With his future at the club beyond June 2025 now uncertain, have reported that the Citizens have earmarked Girona boss Michel as the man to replace their current manager. It has been suggested that the Sky Blues' hierarchy admire the LALIGA coach's tactical prowess, as well as his ability to nurture young talent. It is believed they feel those characteristics are key to helping the club maintain what Guardiola has already put in place. Michel took over at Girona in 2021, and guided them to promotion from the Spanish second tier in his first season. The following campaign, the side finished 10th in LALIGA with 49 points. Most recently, in the 2023/24 season, he led them to a third-place finish with 81 points, four behind Barcelona and 14 behind eventual league winners Real Madrid. While the 48-year-old has reportedly caught the eye of those at the Etihad, there are other candidates who have been shortlisted as potential Guardiola replacements, with the list believed to also include former Brighton & Hove Albion boss Roberto De Zerbi, Germany's Julian Nagelsmann, and Bayer Leverkusen manager Xabi Alonso.",

The 1-0 loss to Cape Town City at Loftus Versfeld on the weekend was coach Rulani Mokwena's first-ever league defeat this season and also ended the team's hopes of finishing the league campaign unbeaten. Prior to the defeat to the Eric Tinkler's men, Sundowns last experienced a defeat in a league match against Tshwane rivals SuperSport United in 2022. \"Sundowns is forever on our lips because they've done a lot of great things, which we are happy to see,\" Buthelezi tells \"What Patrice Motsepe wanted is becoming a reality. First of all, for me, it proves money can buy love. \"That shows with the way Sundowns have been making us as former players happy. \"It's nice to see the boys winning and at the same time making money. The boys proved that the sky is the limit if a club owner respects his players. \"There are club owners that don't respect their players, hence they are not progressing. \"We must thank Patrice Motsepe for turning Sundowns into what it is today. They had a great season Sundowns, they also did well in continental football this season. \"Fatigue is what prevented them from reaching the CAF Champions League final, it was my wish to see them playing in the final.\"",

        "content": "The RAF has grounded a fleet of Spitfire planes after the death of a pilot over the weekend, raising the prospect of the legendary aircraft being absent from the 80th anniversary of the D-day landings next month. Sqn Ldr Mark Long – a Typhoon pilot based at RAF Coningsby – was killed in a crash while flying a Spitfire belonging to the Battle of Britain Memorial Fleet as part of a memorial event. He had been a pilot with the BBMF for the last four years and had been due to take over the event next year. “Following the tragic accident at RAF Coningsby, and while the formal investigation is ongoing, the RAF has instigated a temporary pause in flying for the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight,” an RAF spokesperson said. The air force announcement raises questions about the legendary single-seat fighter aircraft’s participation in the D-day celebrations. They were due to take part in a national commemorative event in Portsmouth on 5 June to mark 80 years since Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy in northern France, turning the tide of the second world war away from Nazi Germany. It is not known when the RAF’s investigation will be complete or when a decision will be made on whether the vintage planes will fly again. King Charles, Queen Camilla and the Prince of Wales will join world leaders – including Joe Biden, the US president, Emmanual Macron, the French president, and Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor – in Normandy for the memorial celebrations. Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The BBMF is a collection of wartime fighter and bomber aircraft that take part in air shows and memorial displays. A few dozen airworthy Spitfires remain, including six based at RAF Coningsby. Paying tribute to Long, Gp Capt Robbie Lees, commander of the Display Air Wing, said on Sunday: “It is with great sorrow that I must confirm the death of Sqn Ldr Mark Long. “Mark was a Typhoon pilot here at RAF Coningsby and for the last four years he has been a pilot with the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight. A great friend, colleague, and a passionate, professional aviator, he will be sorely missed by all who knew him.” “An investigation into the cause of this tragic event has now begun.” The Prince and Princess of Wales led tributes to Long, writing on social media: “Our thoughts ... are with the pilot’s loved ones, the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, and the wider RAF family.

        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked preprint trusted source proofread by Laurence Tognetti, Universe Today How can sunlight reflecting off SpaceX's Starlink satellites interfere with ground-based operations? This is what a study recently posted to the arXiv preprint server hopes to address as a pair of researchers investigate how Starlink satellites appear brighter—which the researchers also refer to as flaring—to observers on Earth when the sun is at certain angles, along with discussing past incidents of how this brightness has influenced aerial operations on Earth. This study holds the potential to help spacecraft manufacturers design and develop specific methods to prevent increased brightness levels, which would help alleviate confusion for observers on Earth regarding the source of the brightness and the objects in question. Here, Universe Today discusses this research with Anthony Mallama of the IAU—Center for the Protection of Dark and Quiet Skies from Satellite Constellation Interference regarding the motivation behind the study, significant results, potential follow-up studies, importance of studying Starlink satellite brightness, and implications for managing satellite constellations in the future. So, what was the motivation behind this study? \"I study the brightness of Starlink satellites under all circumstances,\" Mallama tells Universe Today. \"That includes their operational phase at 550 km [342 mi] altitude, when they are rising from the initial orbit around 300 km [186 mi] to operation height, ordinary flares which occur frequently but have small amplitudes and these extreme flares.\" For the study, the researchers conducted a geometrical analysis of the brightness of Starlink satellites based on the sun's location and angle in the sky. This comes despite SpaceX taking steps to mitigate reflectivity off Starlink satellites, which only decreases reflectivity when the satellites are directly overhead. The study also discussed how reflectivity from Starlink satellites has affected aerial operations, specifically with commercial airline pilots. What were the most significant results from this study? Mallama tells Universe Today, \"This study demonstrated that Starlinks can be exceedingly bright under certain conditions. In one instance they were reported as Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAP) by pilots on two commercial aircraft.\" Regarding potential follow-up studies, Mallama tells Universe Today, \"I am characterizing the brightness of other satellite constellations including Amazon's Kuiper, AST SpaceMobile's BlueWalker/BlueBirds and Planet's Pelicans.\" The study mentions how the UAP incidents occurred in 2022 and was recently discussed in Buettner et al (2024) with the pilots' reporting brightness magnitudes (also called stellar magnitude or apparent magnitude) of -4 to -5. For context, a stellar magnitude of -5 is equivalent to the planet Venus at its brightest, which is known for being observed before sunrise or after sunset periodically throughout the year. The apparent magnitude scale ranges from -30 to 30 with higher numbers corresponding to decreasing brightness. Buettner et al (2024) was recently presented at the 4th IAA Conference on Space Situational Awareness ( ICSSA ). That paper discussed how the incident occurred on August 10, 2022, and was observed by five pilots aboard two separate commercial airline flights over the Pacific Ocean, which resulted in two photographs obtained by the pilot's cell phones. After analyzing a series of simulations and additional data, the researchers determined these UAPs were Starlink satellites launched earlier that day, which were designated as Starlink Group 4-26. Given this incident, what is the importance of studying Starlink brightness/flaring? Mallama tells Universe Today, \"The importance of studying Starlink brightness is that the satellites interfere with astronomical research if they are brighter than magnitude 7. Furthermore, casual sky watchers, such as amateur astronomers and naturalists, are distracted by those brighter than magnitude 6 because they are visible to the unaided eye.\" This study comes as SpaceX's Starlink constellation continues to grow on a regular basis, with the number of current Starlink satellites in orbit having reached more than 5,600 with almost 6,000 having been launched by SpaceX as of this writing. As noted by both the study and Mallama, sunlight reflectivity off Starlink satellites causes issues with both aerial operations on Earth and astronomical observing, with Mallama also conducting research on satellite constellation brightness for Amazon, AST SpaceMobile, and Planet Labs. Therefore, with the number of satellites in orbit rapidly increasing due to constellations, what implications could this study have on managing satellite constellations in the future? Mallama tells Universe Today, \"One approach to reducing satellite brightness is to reflect sunlight into space rather than allowing it to scatter diffusively toward observers on the ground. That works very well most of the time. However, there are certain sun-satellite-observer geometries where it fails and observers see a mirror-like reflection of the sun.\" Mallam published a 2023 article with Sky & Telescope discussing how SpaceX's second-generation of Starlink satellites are fainter than their predecessors. Mallama credits his co-author, Richard Cole, as playing a \"crucial role\" in this study, noting how Cole \"predicted the extreme flares based on his numerical model of Starlink satellite brightness.\" How will sunlight reflectivity off Starlink satellites influence ground operations in the coming years and decades, and what steps can be taken to mitigate this activity? Only time will tell. More information: Anthony Mallama et al, Extreme Flaring of Starlink Satellites, arXiv (2024).

        "description": "KKR leave Andre Russell in splits with viral BPL interview",
        "content": "Listen to Story KKR all-rounder Andre Russell was left in laughter as the franchise's media team recreated his viral interview after the side's triumph in the Indian Premier Leguae (IPL) 2024 Final over SRH on May 26. After marking an emphatic victory over the Pat Cummins-led SRH, KKR became the second-most successful franchise in the history of the IPL by clinching their third-ever title. During an interaction with the KKR media team, Russell was asked the viral question back from his Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) side, Duronto Dhaka's triumph in the 2023 season -\" Final match your perform what happening?\". The video became an instant hit amongst cricket fans around the world in no time. In a video uploaded by KKR's social media handles, the side's media personnel went around the team's stars like Sunil Narine and Russel about their experience of winning the IPL 2024 title. At the end of the video, the two were asked the viral question, which left them comically surprised. In the video from BPL 2023, Russell was left troubled about understanding the question from the interviewer, and that ultimately went on to become a widely used meme all over social media.

Final match you perform what happening @Russell12A ð #KKRvSRH #IPLFinal #IPL2024 pic.twitter.com/ztiYcxzWNc — Wasim Jaffer (@WasimJaffer14) May 26, 2024 After being roped in by KKR ahead of IPL 2014, Russell has since emerged as one of the leading figures and a key part of the franchise for the last 10 years. However, this was a first IPL final for the 36-year-old, after having missed out on the IPL 2014 final for his side due to an injury. In their IPL 2024 campaign, Russell has often played a pivotal role with both the bat and the ball for KKR and helping them clinch the title. A post shared by Kolkata Knight Riders (@kkriders) A post shared by IPL (@iplt20) Batting usually at number 6 or 7 for KKR, Russell showcased his trademark explosiveness with the bat and scored 222 runs in his 15 appearances throughout IPL 2024. With the ball, Russell had a brilliant season which saw him pick 19 wickets across the season.",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

        "content": "FURTHER CUTS TO interest rates and energy prices are on the cards, according to Finance Minister Michael McGrath. Speaking to reporters at the National Economic Dialogue in Dublin Castle today, the minister said Ireland’s inflation rate is one of the lowest in the Euro area, running at around 2%. “We are likely to be at a turning point in the interest rate cycle. We expect further energy price reductions to be passed through the wholesale level to the retail level. We will see an improvement in living standards for many people. “The vast majority of households in Ireland will see gains in real terms across 2024. So that’s very positive,” he said. His comments come as the chief economist of the European Central Bank Philip Lane has indicated that the ECB should be in a position to begin cutting interest rates from next week. McGrath said there is still a need to be careful in the decisions government makes over the next year, due to the “deep uncertainty” surrounding geopolitical tensions. Speaking about the budget this year, the minister said there will be measures to support households with the cost of living. He said there will be a social welfare package and income tax cuts. He said there should be a move away from one-off cost-of-living measures, given the fall in inflation, and a move towards permanent measures and permanent changes to taxation frameworks. While there has been speculation of the budget being brought forward, perhaps in time for an autumn election, McGrath said today that the budget will be at normal time in October. The minister said in the coming weeks he will bring a memorandum to the government to confirm the date of the budget, stating: “There are no plans to change the budget date from normal periods.”",

        "description": "Health authorities are working to gather information on the spread of the H5N1 virus, or bird flu, in U.S. dairy cows—the first confirmation of the virus in cattle.",
        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread by Carol Clark, Emory University Health authorities are working to gather information on the spread of the H5N1 virus, or bird flu, in U.S. dairy cows—the first confirmation of the virus in cattle. \"We have moved into new territory,\" says Thomas Gillespie, professor and chair of Emory University's Department of Environmental Sciences. The dairy cow infections are simply the latest twist in a global pattern: since 2022, bird flu has been infecting a wide variety of mammals. \"You can find this trend around the world, almost anywhere you look,\" Gillespie says. \"This virus has an extremely broad range of hosts that it is able to infect.\" Gillespie is a disease ecologist, studying how pathogens jump across species in the environment. He is a leader in the \"One Health\" approach—considering the deep connections between the health of people, domesticated animals, wildlife and ecosystems—to build pandemic control and prevention. The avian influenza cases in cows have been mild. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed two human cases connected to the outbreak—one in Texas and one in Michigan. Both cases were mild and involved people who worked on a dairy farm. The pasteurization process kills the H5N1 virus, and the CDC describes the current risk to the general public as \"low.\" The H5N1 virus is known as avian influenza, or bird flu, because birds are its natural reservoir. Wild, migrating birds can spread H5N1 globally. The current version has been circulating since 2020 and has infected a greater diversity of bird species than past lineages. The virus has been reported in birds in the United States since 2022. Poultry producers have culled millions of their animals to try to control the spread of the virus. It has long been known that mammals can become infected with H5N1 when they eat infected birds or are exposed to environments contaminated with the virus. What is unprecedented is the current scale and variety of mammals that have been infected. \"Most of these are likely dead-end cases, where a predator eats an infected bird and gets sick but doesn't spread the virus,\" Gillespie says. He adds, however, that recent die-offs of thousands of elephant seals, sea lions and fur seals in South America caused by bird flu raises concerns about the possibility of mammal-to-mammal transmission. \"Not enough surveillance is done in wildlife to know for sure how the virus is spreading,\" he says. H5N1 has also been reported in foxes, otters, lynx, polecats and badgers in Europe and in raccoon dogs and foxes in Japan. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has recorded detections of H5N1 in 200 mammals in the United States since 2022, including a bottlenose dolphin , foxes, bobcats, mountain lions, coyotes, skunks, harbor and gray seals, opossums, squirrels, minks, otters and black and brown bears. Last December, a polar bear on Alaska's North Slope became the first of its species known to die of avian influenza. In 2023, the virus was also been detected for the first time in the Antarctic region—in birds, elephant seals and fur seals—raising fears for the health of the fragile ecosystem. \"Some of the species that are at risk for bird flu are already battling the stressors of climate change and loss of habitat,\" Gillespie says. And each time H5N1 infects a new animal host, it gives the virus a chance to mix with other flu strains and rearrange its genetic material. Accumulating such mutations can change the virus in ways that make it more easily transmissible and more deadly—including to humans. Pigs' immune systems share similarities with humans, making swine especially efficient mixing bowls for viruses that can affect humans. Gillespie cites deforestation and industrialized animal production as major drivers for the risk of pandemics as well as climate change. Forests in tropical regions are rapidly degrading due to cattle ranching and the clearing of land for agricultural crops such as soybeans—which are mainly used as feed for chickens and pigs on industrial farms. \"The resulting cheap meat that we buy does not reflect the true costs to the ecosystems that sustain us,\" Gillespie says. \"If we want to live sustainably, we need to cut down on the amount of animal products that we consume. That will be a win-win for human health and for planetary health.\" Provided by Emory University",

        "content": "Travelers move through Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport ahead of Memorial Day on Friday in Atlanta. Mike Stewart/Associated Press ATLANTA — A record was broken ahead of the Memorial Day weekend for the number of airline travelers screened at U.S. airports, the Transportation Security Administration said Saturday. More than 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports on Friday, surpassing a previous record set last year on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, according to the Transportation Security Agency. “Officers have set a new record for most travelers screened in a single day!” the TSA tweeted. “We recommend arriving early.” The third busiest day on record was set on Thursday when just under 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports. Atlanta, the world’s busiest airport had its busiest day ever. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport broke a traffic record on Thursday when 111,000 passengers, airline crew and airport employees were screened at security checkpoints. The second busiest day followed on Friday when 109,960 people were screened, according to the TSA. With 104.6 million passengers, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, according to Airports Council International. U.S. airlines expect to carry a record number of passengers this summer. Their trade group estimates that 271 million travelers will fly between June 1 and August 31, breaking the record of 255 million set last summer. AAA predicted this will be the busiest start-of-summer weekend in nearly 20 years, with 43.8 million people expected to roam at least 50 miles from home between Thursday and Monday – 38 million of them taking vehicles. The annual expression of wanderlust that accompanies the start of the summer travel season is happening at a time when Americans tell pollsters they are worried about the economy and the direction of the country. In what had long been celebrated every May 30 to honor America’s fallen soldiers, Memorial Day officially became a federal holiday in 1971, observed on the last Monday in May. Jason Redman, a retired Navy SEAL who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, told The Associated Press last year that he honors the friends he’s lost.

        "content": "The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has discovered hundreds of new worlds, with TESS planet candidates now outnumbering the total number of confirmed planets from Kepler. Owing to differences in survey design, TESS continues to provide planets that are better suited for subsequent follow-up studies, including mass measurement through radial velocity (RV) observations, compared to Kepler targets. In this work, we present the TESS-Keck Survey’s (TKS) Mass Catalog: a uniform analysis of all TKS RV survey data which has resulted in mass constraints for 126 planets and candidate signals. This includes 58 mass measurements that have reached ≥5σ precision. We confirm or validate 32 new planets from the TESS mission either by significant mass measurement (15) or statistical validation (17), and we find no evidence of likely false positives among our entire sample. This work also serves as a data release for all previously unpublished TKS survey data, including 9,204 RV measurements and associated activity indicators over our three year survey. We took the opportunity to assess the performance of our survey, and found that we achieved many of our goals including measuring the mass of 38 small (<4R⊕) planets, nearly achieving the TESS mission’s basic science requirement. In addition, we evaluated the performance of the Automated Planet Finder (APF) as survey support and observed meaningful constraints on system parameters due to its more uniform phase coverage. Finally, we compared our measured masses to those predicted by commonly used mass-radius relations and investigated evidence of systematic bias. Alex S. Polanski, Jack Lubin, Corey beard, Jospeh M.

        "content": "First, it was Toys “R” Us. Then, Bed Bath & Beyond. Now, perhaps the most personally painful demise of a legendary franchise that helped to shape my psyche (and my penchant for complimentary appetizers), our local Red Lobster, along with over 90 other locations nationwide, recently bit the dust, or the biscuit – as it were. I guess we all saw it coming in the carnage of crippled restaurant chains that COVID-19 left in its wake. Red Lobster was never quite the same haven of succulent, mass-produced seafood after the pandemic. In particular, they inexplicably excised their scrumptious seafood gumbo from the menu – one of the main reasons I loved the place, and the only reason my eldest and most expensive daughter ever wanted to go. Granted, the carpet was dingy, the nautical decor was corny, and the lobster tanks invoked a sort of morbid fascination that made us all wish they’d take those rubber bands off the lobsters’ claws and let them have a battle royale to entertain us while we waited seemingly forever for our table. But still we went, if for no other reason than those indescribably delicious Cheddar Bay Biscuits, the presentation of which by our server invoked a kind of joy comparable only to the delivery of one’s firstborn child. Well, maybe not that much joy . . . but almost. Speaking of joy, in the late summer after my senior year of high school, when I had finally learned to apply the perfect combination of Right Guard deodorant and Calvin Klein Obsession for Men cologne, I took my future wife to Red Lobster one Sunday after church for our first real date. For an eighteen-year-old aspiring stud-muffin on a city-pool-lifeguard salary, Red Lobster was a big deal, and I thought she’d be especially impressed by the big brass lobster claw door handles. I know I was. It was there, gazing at each other across elegant entrees of fries and popcorn shrimp, that we found true love among the crustaceans. After we had children, we began a tradition of visiting Red Lobster after the evening Christmas Eve service at church since it was usually one of the very few restaurants open and we weren’t in the mood for pancakes – even international ones. I always requested kid’s menus for our daughters – even when they were teenagers – so that we could guess at the silly trivia games, play tic-tac-toe, and take turns embarrassing my wife by inserting crayons in various facial orifices – usually right when the server showed up. Besides, the food at Red Lobster just tasted good. I know there are seafood snobs out there who scoffed at what were undoubtedly pre-cooked, frozen menu items that required little more than a boiling bag, a deep fryer or an industrial microwave, but in East Texas, it was the next best thing to a mess of fried crappie if you asked me, and I’ll miss it.

        "content": "Bill Walton celebrates after the Celtics won the Eastern Conference finals in May 1986. Walton, who starred for UCLA and later played for NBA champions in Portland and Boston before becoming a broadcasting star, died at 71. Steve Pyle/Associated Press Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career – disrupted by chronic foot injuries – lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,’ ” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA Coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Success.

        "content": "GATINEAU, Que. — The Competition Bureau says market concentration, prices and a rising tally of customer complaints are fuelling its study into Canada's airline industry. The regulator says two carriers continue to dominate the skies while new airlines seem to struggle to enter the market. The bureau also says domestic fares appear relatively high and that more and more passengers are filing complaints. The regulator says its market study, which will draw on feedback from the public and interested parties, will pave the way for recommendations to government that would improve competition and make it easier for consumers to make informed choices. The market study announced May 9 is the bureau's first since it gained new powers in December that include the ability to compel information from companies. Over the past 13 months, newer low-cost carriers Swoop and Lynx Air have disappeared from the skies and WestJet scooped up Sunwing Airlines, with the latter two making up 72 per cent of seat capacity from Western Canada last year, according to the bureau.

        "description": "According to the Washington Post, Alito's wife, Martha-Ann, shouted, \"It’s an international signal of distress\" after being probed by the reporter on the flag.",
        "content": "The Washington Post revealed on Saturday that the outlet initially passed on the Samuel Alito flag story in 2021 after its former Supreme Court reporter had a confrontation over it with the justice’s wife. “The Post decided not to report on the episode at the time because the flag-raising appeared to be the work of Martha-Ann Alito, rather than the justice, and connected to a dispute with her neighbors,” the Washington Post report said, citing a spokesperson for the paper. “It was not clear then that the argument was rooted in politics.” Former Washington Post Supreme Court reporter Robert Barnes went to the Alitos’ home in 2021 after receiving a tip on the flag. According to the outlet, Alito’s wife, Martha-Ann, shouted, “It’s an international signal of distress” after being probed by the reporter on the flag. An upside-down American flag, a symbol used by the former president’s supporters who falsely claim President Biden did not win the 2020 election, was seen flying at Alito’s home in the weeks following the Jan. 6 riot, The New York Times first reported last week. Alito previously told Fox News that his wife was the one who hung the flag in response to insults from a neighbor. Cameron Barr, the former senior managing editor, took responsibility for not running the story at the time, according to Semafor. “I agreed with [Supreme Court reporter] Bob Barnes and others that we should not do a single-slice story about the flag, because it seemed like the story was about Martha-Ann Alito and not her husband,” Barr told the outlet. Semafor referred to the decision as “cautious and deferential, and very pre-Dobbs,” suggesting it meant more now after the Supreme Court’s conservative majority overturned Roe v.

Members of the media and prominent Democratic lawmakers are calling on Alito to recuse himself from all cases before the court that are related to Donald Trump. Conservatives have said the story is much ado about nothing and part of a wider effort to delegitimize the Supreme Court. “In retrospect, I should have pushed harder for that story,” Barr told Semafor. Alito’s wife reportedly told the Washington Post reporter to ask their neighbors what they did and told the reporter to get off their property. Another symbol carried by Trump supporters, an “Appeal to Heaven” flag , was seen flying at a beach home owned by Alito in New Jersey, the New York Times reported days after their initial report. The flag, also known as the Pine Tree flag, dates back to the Revolutionary War.",

        "content": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Both the CPM and the state government have found themselves entangled in the controversy over the new liquor policy. The party is of the view that relaxations in the liquor policy are necessary for the development of the tourism sector in the state and to attract more investment in industrial and IT parks. However, the controversy erupted even before the government took a decision on the liquor policy. In this situation, how can the government announce relaxations in the liquor policy? If the government announces relaxations, it will be interpreted as the confirmation of taking bribes from the bar owners. The party and the government are finding it hard to make a decision on the matter. Neither the CPM nor the LDF has held a discussion on the bar owners' bar owners' demands to do away with the dry day system and extend the operating hours of bars. The controversy broke out when a voice message sent by a leader of the bar owners' association asking each bar owner to pay Rs 2.50 lakhs in exchange for the relaxations from the government came out. The voice message was sent by Animon, a state leader of the Federation of Kerala Bar Association. It is alleged that there is a massive bribery deal behind this. The opposition is planning to launch widespread protests against the government even though CPM state secretary MV Govindan and Excise Minister MB Rajesh are claiming that the government has not even started a preliminary discussion on the liquor policy. Opposition targeting Chief Minister The opposition, which demanded the resignation of Excise Minister MB Rajesh, turned against Tourism Minister PA Mohammed Riyas after the details of the meeting called by the Tourism Director came out. It is asking if the Tourism Director would call a meeting without the knowledge of the Tourism Minister. By portraying Minister Riyas as the main mastermind in the bar bribery controversy, the opposition is targeting Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The opposition is also trying to take advantage of the resentment that a section of the CPM has towards Riyas.",

        "content": "OAKLAND — Firefighters stood watch on Monday over the smoldering remains of a long-time lumber yard in Oakland that was scorched by a four-alarm fire this weekend, as an investigation into the blaze begins. The fire consumed Economy Lumber at 750 High Street in Oakland. The Oakland Fire Department said the blaze was first reported around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday. By 11 p.m., the same night, firefighters had contained the fire, Oakland fire spokesperson Michael Hunt said. “Crews are still on scene at Economy Lumber,” Hunt said Monday. “We’ll probably be on scene most of the day.” The wrecked complex is the site of one of four lumber yards that Economy Lumber operates in the Bay Area. Oakland fire investigators were attempting to determine the cause of the fire. The Oakland Fire Department also began working with the property owner and a heavy equipment operator to pull apart the building so crews could reach any remaining hot spots, Hunt said. About 75 firefighters responded to the site of the fire Sunday. No injuries were reported as a result of the blaze. Economy Lumber has been in business since 1935. The company was born as a small lumber business and eventually expanded to four Bay Area locations. It wasn’t immediately known when 750 High Street lumber yard began operating.",

        "content": "The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, on Sunday, announced that it would work with Schlumberger Global to develop frontier oil basins in Nigeria. Schlumberger, globally known as SLB Global, is a major player in the oil and gas industry, while Nigeria’s frontier basins are regions with potential for oil and gas reserves that have not been extensively explored yet. The Chief Executive, NUPRC, Gbenga Komolafe, hosted a delegation from the global oil firm led by its President, Olivier Le Peuch, where both parties discussed developing Nigeria’s frontier basins, according to a statement issued in Abuja by the upstream regulatory commission. “Areas of mutual interest discussed include the development of Nigeria’s frontier basins and the integration of innovative technologies to enhance exploration and production efficiencies,” NUPRC stated, The frontier basins hold promise for increasing Nigeria’s hydrocarbon production and they include the Anambra, Benue Trough (Lower, Middle, Upper), Chad (South-Eastern sector), Dahomey, Bida (Mid-Niger), Sokoto, and Deep/Ultra-deep offshore. The significance of the basins is that they are new sources of oil and gas revenue for Nigeria, with the potential for natural gas reserves for domestic use and export. NUPRC is responsible for overseeing frontier basin exploration through regulations, and the basins are seen as a way to ensure Nigeria’s long-term energy security and economic growth. The statement stated that the meeting between NUPRC and Schlumberger underscored the commission’s commitment to fostering strategic partnerships that would enhance Nigeria’s oil production and operational efficiency. It said the purpose of the visit was to explore specific areas of collaboration and partnership between both organisations. During the meeting, Komolafe said the NUPRC adopts a participatory and collaborative approach to facilitate ease of doing business in the oil sector. He highlighted several of the commission’s feats since its inception in 2021 under the Petroleum Industry Act, adding that key achievements include the establishment of 17 regulations aimed at improving industry standards and operational efficiency. “Additionally, the re-engineering of the Nigeria National Data Repository has been a significant milestone, promoting the monetisation of oil blocks and aligning regulations with global energy transition initiatives and carbon footprint reduction goals,” the commission stated. It said Komolafe also mentioned the ongoing licensing rounds as a testament to the commission’s proactive approach in regulating the sector. “One notable achievement expounded upon was the NUPRC’s commitment to eliminating gas flaring and commercialising flared gas under the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme. “This initiative has designated 49 flare sites for commercialisation, demonstrating the commission’s dedication to environmental sustainability and resource optimisation,” the agency stated. On his part, Le Peuch expressed satisfaction with the commission’s regulatory framework and indicated SLB Global’s readiness to collaborate. He reiterated the importance of such partnerships in unlocking Nigeria’s onshore and offshore oil potential, particularly through leveraging advanced technology. “At the end of the meeting, it was agreed that a contact team would be established to further investigate and identify more opportunities for collaboration. The team will focus on expanding the scope of mutual interests and ensuring that both organisations can effectively work together to achieve their shared objectives,” NUPRC stated.",

        "description": "Boxing legend left nauseous and dizzy after an ulcer flare-up during a journey from Miami to Los Angeles",
        "content": "Sport | Boxing Mike Tyson has reportedly suffered a medical scare during a cross-country flight in the USA, less than two months before he is scheduled to face Jake Paul in his high-profile boxing comeback. American outlet In Touch Weekly first reported on Monday that the former undisputed heavyweight world champion had a medical emergency on a delayed flight from Miami to Los Angeles on Sunday night, with eyewitnesses reporting an announcement asking for a doctor before paramedics boarded the plane following its landing at LAX. In a statement subsequently delivered to the New York Post , Tyson’s representatives insisted that the 57-year-old was now doing well after an ulcer issue caused him to become nauseous and dizzy towards the end of the flight. “Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great,” the statement read. “He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare-up 30 minutes before landing. “He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him. “However, it’s false reporting that his medical attention caused the flight delay. This two-hour delay was due to an air conditioning issue on the aircraft.” Tyson is in the midst of preparing for his sensational and controversial return to the sport where he remains one of the most iconic figures, 19 years since the last of his 58 professional fights when he retired on his stool against Ireland’s Kevin McBride in Washington DC. It was announced back in early March that ‘Iron Mike’ would be coming out of retirement to take on YouTuber-turned-boxer Paul in a blockbuster contest to be held at the 80,000-capacity AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas - home of the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys - on July 20, screened live on Netflix. It will be Tyson’s first involvement in the ring since he fought an eight-round exhibition draw against fellow legendary ex-boxing champion Roy Jones Jr in LA in 2020, with Paul knocking out basketball player Nate Robinson in only his second professional bout on the undercard at Staples Center. It was initially unclear if the fight, which pits Tyson against a man 31 years his junior, would be another exhibition or a professional contest, until confirmation arrived last month that it had been officially sanctioned as a pro bout by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. The fight will consist of eight rounds lasting two minutes each, with heavier 14-ounce gloves and no headgear to be worn. Taylor vs Catterall 2 LIVE!

        "description": "The Oakwood site \"is a profound testament to the enduring spirit and historical significance of New York City’s African American community,” said Concilmember Kamillah Hanks.",
        "content": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — A nearly 100-year-old Oakwood cemetery originally built for African Americans took another step toward landmark status this week after the city’s Landmarks Preservation Commission held a hearing Tuesday. Frederick Douglass Memorial Park, at the corner of Amboy Road and Montreal Avenue , looks poised for landmark status as multiple people testified in support during the hearing, including Councilwoman Kamillah Hanks (D-North Shore), who chairs the Council’s Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Disposition. “Frederick Douglass Memorial Park...is more than a cemetery. It is a profound testament to the enduring spirit and historical significance of New York City’s African American community,” Hanks said. “Landmark status will provide the necessary support and resources to maintain and enhance the park allowing it to continue serving as a place of reflection, remembrance and celebration of African American Heritage.” Hanks’ local colleagues, Council Minority Leader Joseph Borelli (R-South Shore) and Councilman David Carr (R-Mid-Island), have also offered their support to the cemetery’s landmark push. During a recent tour of the grounds, Frederick Douglass Memorial Park Board President Brandon Stradford and members Debbie-Ann Paige and Lisa Wallace said the landmark designation would help them better maintain the cemetery. While rich in historic significance, the memorial park still functions as a modern, 14.88-acre cemetery, accommodating burials a few times each week for people of all races and denominations. It has also been used for the Richmond County Public Administrator’s Burial Program, which provides dignified burials to descendants who have no families to handle them. At Tuesday’s hearing, Stradford told the Landmarks Preservation Commission about the importance of the cemetery to the African American community and to its current stewards, in particular. Most members of the board have family members interred there. “The place is really special to us. It’s not just something of interest, something that we said ‘this has fallen down, oh let’s grab a hold of that,’” he said. “It’s part of my legacy, our legacy.” STEEPED IN HISTORY Rodney Dade, a Harlem funeral director, founded the cemetery in 1933 after seeing the bigotry Black people faced in the five boroughs when burying their loved ones. Cemeteries around the city often segregated Black dead people to undesirable areas on their grounds, and forced their families through various indignities, Mary Ann-Hurley, who presented Frederick Douglass Memorial Park’s landmark case to Landmarks Preservation Commission in March, said at the time. Founders named the park for Frederick Douglass, the 19th century abolitionist and statesman born into slavery, and began burying people in 1935. Douglass is buried in Rochester. As one of the few cemeteries entirely open to Black people, Frederick Douglass Memorial Park accepted a host of prominent figures, including blues singer Mamie Smith, Negro League baseball players Elias “Country Brown” Bryant and King Solomon “Sol” White, Rabbi Wentworth Arthur Matthew, Founder of Commandment Keepers Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation in Harlem and Joanna Berry Shields, a Founder of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first Black sorority. RECOVERING FROM NEGLECT During that recent tour, signs of care, like flowers and other mementos, could be seen at individual graves around the park, but decades of neglect preceding the current board have left the site in need of work. In 2008, the Advance/SILive.com reported that Frederick Douglass Memorial Park was in danger of becoming an abandoned cemetery after years of mismanagement. The state Division of Cemeteries, which regulates nonsectarian cemeteries like Frederick Douglass Memorial Park, first raised alarm bells about management there in 1999. In 2005, the state courts removed a former director of the cemetery, issued a $667,593 judgment against her, and put the cemetery into a receivership. That receivership wasn’t without controversy after the third individual to take on the role tore down historic gates at the park entrance, leading to a lawsuit that was eventually dismissed. Today, the stewards of Frederick Douglass Memorial Park want to move on from the past few decades, and hope securing a landmark status can help them do so. COMMISSION HEARS ‘MOVING TESTIMONY’ Landmarks Preservation Commission Vice Chair Frederick Bland, serves on the board of another city cemetery with landmark status, and said it’s been vital in helping them maintain their grounds. For Landmark Preservation Commissioner Angie Master, the only Staten Islander serving on the Commission, Fredrick Douglass Memorial Park would be the first local site to receive the status since her term began last year . “I’m just so happy with the community support and how the cemetery folks have come out here and express themselves so articulately, and it’s such a deserving individual landmark,” she said. While the Commission has yet to schedule a final vote for whether Frederick Douglass Memorial Park will receive its landmark status, it seems to be trending in the right direction. Commission Chair Sarah Carroll noted as she closed the portion of the meeting related to the Memorial Park that Master’s comments may have been out of place — typically, commissioners wait until their votes to offer their explicit support — but that they were understood given the cause. “We’re not technically commenting today but I think the testimony was so moving it sort of warranted those feelings and thoughts,” she said.",

Sir Keir was first elected to the Commons in 2015 on a Labour manifesto pledge to trim fees to such levels, with universities’ income made up through increased state support. But it would not be lost on him that even though his party had won the argument, Labour lost that election. Tax and spending promises lie at the heart of modern election campaigns in Britain. The experience of being put on the back foot over economic issues has led Labour to an almost crippling cautiousness. Sir Keir has sought to close down opportunities for the Tories to label his plans as “tax bombshells”. There are differences between Labour and the Tories. But they are small. Labour’s proposed tax rises – VAT on private school fees, ending the non-dom regime, and a crackdown on tax avoidance – don’t affect the majority of voters, but they do suggest a targeting of unfair advantage. Labour’s proposals raise about £10bn, a sum dwarfed by the size of the public sector and its problems. Rishi Sunak’s government missed its recruitment target for teachers by more than 13,000 teachers last year. Labour promises to hire just half that number for £350m. The party has also pledged to spend £1.1bn to pay health staff extra for out-of-hours working to deliver the promised 40,000 weekly operations, scans or appointments. That is welcome, but there are 7m GP appointments every week in England alone. Spending is restrained in part because Labour is targeting a balanced current budget. Even if the economy turns out as forecast, this leaves a Labour government having to either deliver spending cuts to non-ringfenced departments or raise taxes. This fiscal rule could be weaponised by Labour to tap into public frustrations about inequality . But Sir Keir is trying to distance himself from the politics of redistribution. Instead, voters are left with austerity economics, as they are with Labour’s retention of the Conservative fiscal rule that debt as a share of GDP has to be falling by the fifth year of a Treasury forecast. Most investment spending won’t pay for itself in such a short period, limiting Labour’s ambitions. Sir Keir should think bigger, because the fixes that the country needs exceed what he has offered so far. Reducing the wasteful consumption of the wealthy to make resources available for socially useful spending must be the aim of Labour’s tax policy. Bolder policies can capture voters’ imaginations, if they are clearly communicated and chime with the public’s priorities. The risk is that they become hostages to fortune. However, Mr Sunak will find it hard to appeal to voters’ sense of prudence when their experience of Conservative government has been rising costs, falling living standards and failing public services.",

        "description": "Photographer Tim Morris got the chance to visit the school he used to attend back in the 1970s",
        "content": "For a lot of us, school days are remembered with affection. From forming lifelong friendships to keeping up with the latest fashion trends, school was the most exciting part of our young lives even if it didn't always seem that way at the time. When we walk through their doors for the last time, for most of us, it's an opportunity we'll never have again. But not for photographer Tim Morris, who got to visit his former school, Dyffryn Lower Comprehensive School in Port Talbot, almost half a century later. Dyffryn Comprehensive School, which was officially opened in 1966, was situated on two sites. Year 7 and Year 8 pupils were taught at the Lower School, which was located on Talcennau Road in the town, while Year 9, 10 and 11 pupils attended the Upper School on Bertha Road in Margam. READ MORE: 25 nostalgic pictures of life in Wales in the 1990s that feel like they were taken yesterday LATEST: 60 photos which show what life was like in Wales 20 years ago Eventually, both schools were closed to make way for a bigger school - Ysgol Cwm Brombil, which is now home to children from the ages of three to 16. In 2019, the former Upper School buildings were demolished, and in the same year, the Lower School building was deemed as \"surplus\" to the operational requirements of the Education, Leisure and Lifelong Learning Directorate. Now, the former school on Talcennau Road is facing a new chapter in its life. In May of last year, Neath Port Talbot Council's planning committee approved plans for new homes. It is set to see the construction of 43 affordable properties built on the site by developers Linc Cymru, along with an internal road network, landscaping, and additional car parking. You can read more about the proposed plans here. Ahead of the work taking place, developers got in contact with Tim Morris, to invite him to take photographers of the old site before the major changes get underway. The photographer took pictures of the derelict site in the space of four supervised visits with the developers. Here are some of the best photos of the school. He also shared his experience of taking photographs of his former school. Tim Morris explained that the first time he went to Dyffryn Lower Comprehensive School as a pupil was in 1974 at the age of 11 - almost 50 years ago Tim has been an avid photographer all his life and mostly enjoys taking photographs of buildings \"I hadn't done schools until now,\" he said. \"I've done farm houses, industrial places, military places. They were all legal - I don't break into these places. Going into my old school and having a look around was great.\" Tim said he attended the nearby Central Junior School before going to Dyffryn Lower. He said: \"Dyffryn was a much bigger school, they had more children than we had in the junior school. Coming from the Central School, I was one of the biggest, largest boys and then I went to Dyffryn - even though there were only two years there, I became one of the youngest.\" \"As an 11-year-old, you don’t really appreciate the architecture of the school or the buildings while you're in it,\" Tim said. \"I could walk to the school because my parents’ house in Port Talbot was about a five-minute walk away. I could walk to it then and I could see it.\" \"I was aware that the school had closed, but didn’t know when it had closed. I go to Port Talbot to visit my parents, but I don’t really socialise in Port Talbot anymore - up until recently I didn’t keep up with what was going on in the town.\" Tim explained that he became a member of various art walk groups on social media, one of which is located in Port Talbot. From there, a representative of Linc Cymru got in contact with the group asking if a photographer wanted to take photos of the closed school before work would begin on the site, which Tim volunteered to do. \"The reason I got involved in this is because there is a heritage project aiming to record the school, and also when it’s demolished, to try and have some sort of memorial for the school built into the new housing development.\" Tim first visited the old school in September of last year and went back to take more photographs three more times Tim said: \"I went in twice in September of last year, the next time I wandered from the outside, and then the last time I went in was January of this year.\" When asked what it was like, Tim said that it was \"quite bizarre\" He added: \"The outside buildings haven’t really changed, but the inside - it has changed completely from when I was there, I was trying to remember what it was like.\" \"The old woodworking room is no longer there, that had been repurposed.\" \"The lower part of the school was for the lower year, and it’s strange to think, we were all taught in that building for the whole of our first year.\" \"The only building that had remained the same was the gym - that hadn’t changed since the 70s, it had the same wooden floors and the beams.\" Tim revealed that his favourite subjects while at Dyffryn Lower Comprehensive School were the scientific subjects “I was quite glad that I could go back in a few times. I went in for the first time, and there were things I hadn’t photographed or I thought I hadn’t photographed well. So to go back in a few times afterwards, I could explore the same buildings but from a different angle.\" Dyffryn Comprehensive School, which was officially opened in 1966, was situated on two sites, and Year 7 and Year 8 pupils were taught at the Lower School Some of the work that former pupils did while at Dyffryn Lower \"Going in, I had no idea what it was like, so there was no plan. I remember the layout being there as a boy, but in terms of what the state was like, I just wanted to see what it was like.\" According to Tim, some rooms, including the gym, had remained in tact, while others had been affected by the weather and other elements He said: “The gym photos are the ones that stand out for me, the room seemed fairly intact. But to go to the other extreme, the very first form room that I was in has been badly damaged by rain and various things.\" \"You’ve got the contrast where the building is intact and then the room that has been destroyed.” \"The gym was the highlight for me because it was just like it was back in the 70s, it hadn’t changed whatsoever.\" Even a pair of PE daps had been left in the school \"The changing rooms were the same, very simple, very basic.” The school kitchen had also been frozen in time 'Is it good to live forever?' Even former pupils' work had been left on the school floor Some more work Ystafell yr Athrawon Tim said he \"enjoyed\" the experience of taking photographs of his former school Tim said: \"I’ve shared it on a Facebook group that has been specifically set up for former pupils of Dyffryn School, I joined that and shared the photos. People loved the pictures, but I think people’s memories of the school were good and bad.\" \"Some people had good times, some people had bad times with the place.\" For Tim, he had nothing but fond memories of his former school. He explained that he went on to work within the IT industry and retired as a computer programmer last year, which meant that he had \"more time\" to focus on his photography “I’m surprised with how small the school seems now compared to when I was there.\" Tim said he was \"proud\" of the work that he produced while visiting his former school",

        "description": "Benjamin Netanyahu admits 'tragic mistake' after Rafah strike kills 45",
        "content": "Listen to Story Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local officials. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas, with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel's military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighbourhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from some of Israel's close allies. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto, in a TV interview, said such bombings are “spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren.” Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strike. Egypt's Foreign Ministry called it a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80 per cent of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and UN officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine.",

        "content": "S ector by sector, private equity is making deep inroads into UK public services. More than a decade ago, the collapse of Southern Cross , the private-equity-owned care home operator, revealed the havoc that can be wreaked when essential public services are run by heavily indebted businesses with complex financial structures. Typically, such owners maximise profits by using low-tax jurisdictions, loans, and sale-and-leaseback arrangements that split holding companies from property assets. Present trends show that this cautionary tale is being ignored. A forthcoming report from the Common Wealth thinktank uses the example of the companies that lease trains to railway operators, to demonstrate that private equity companies are pressing their advantage from financial engineering. Britain’s transport network has joined health and social care, children’s homes and some areas of education in offering rich pickings to private-equity investors . The advantages to businesses are obvious. Because these are essential services, whose continued operation is guaranteed in law and by the public’s need for them, the risks are low. On the railways, contracts guaranteeing revenue have turned rolling stock companies into hugely profitable entities at a time when the rest of the industry was forced to make cuts. In health, social care and special needs education, a long-term lack of public investment has limited the options available to commissioners, including NHS bodies and councils. Privately owned businesses are filling the gaps. In 2021, a review by the Competition and Markets Authority noted the high profit margins of children’s home operators and judged the market they are part of to be “dysfunctional”. Yet Tory ministers rejected most of the recommendations of the independent reviewer they had appointed to look at the children’s social care system. Anne Longfield, the former children’s commissioner, is among critics of how businesses based in low-tax jurisdictions are enabled to take money out of statutory services “at an alarming rate”. Yet far from cracking down on opaque accounting, capping profits or making efforts to re-shore taxes, Conservative governments have let a similar pattern emerge in early-years education and childcare. A Guardian investigation last year found investment funds had doubled their stake in childcare in four years, and further expansion is all but guaranteed given the government’s pledge to fund more places, without enabling the public sector to provide them. Awareness of the harm caused by tax havens is wider than it used to be, but international efforts to tackle it have stalled, and UK overseas and crown dependencies have rejected transparency. Meanwhile, the mobile, intangible nature of digital businesses has made it far easier for multinational corporations to avoid taxation. This is a global problem as well as a national one. But the siphoning of profits from heavily subsidised public services – the subsidy is worth around £28bn a year in the case of rolling stock – must be curbed. As the Common Wealth authors point out, austerity and tax havens are a destructive combination. Offshore boots should never be filled at taxpayers’ expense.",

        "content": "Dozens of people were injured on Sunday when strong wind caused large tarpaulins to collapse at two campaign events in México state. The México state government said in a statement that 58 people sustained minor injuries at an event for a mayoral candidate in Xonacatlán, while around 20 people became trapped when a tarp collapsed at an event for a mayoral candidate in Ixtlahuaca, according to reports. Three people were reportedly injured in the latter incident. In Xonacatlán, located about 60 kilometers west of downtown Mexico City, 55 people were treated on-site for minor injuries while one person sought medical care at a hospital “by their own means,” the México state government said. Two other people were taken to hospital by ambulance, one of whom was suffering a nervous breakdown, the government said. In Ixtlahuaca, located around 100 kilometers northwest of Mexico City, three people suffered “bumps” when the tarp and the structure supporting it collapsed, according to the Excélsior newspaper. Paramedics and other emergency personnel assisted and treated the injured in both Xonacatlán and Ixtlahuaca. The accidents occurred at “close of campaign” events for Morena party mayoral candidates in the respective municipalities. They happened five days after strong wind caused a stage to collapse at a Citizens Movement campaign event in the metropolitan area of Monterrey, Nuevo León. Nine people were killed at that event and more than 100 others were injured. Morena’s mayoral candidate in Xonacatlán, Alfredo González, said that “strong gusts of winds” brought the tarp down at his event. The party’s mayoral candidate in Ixtlahuaca, Guadalupe Díaz said in a video message that heavy rain and strong wind caused the tarp to collapse at her event. “Fortunately, ... there aren’t lives to mourn,” she said. Díaz and González are among hundreds of candidates vying to become mayors in the 125 municipalities of México state, Mexico’s most populous state. Mexicans will elect some 20,000 municipal, state and federal representatives — including a new president — in the country’s largest ever elections this Sunday.

        "content": "The Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Mr Nyesom Wike, has said there is hope for Nigerians, considering the achievements of President Bola Tinubu in just one year in office. Wike stated this in Abuja on Monday, after he inspected the Southern Parkway Road and Abuja Rail Mass Transit, in preparation for commercial inauguration on May 29. According to Wike, Tinubu has done very well in FCT and the country in just one year, particularly in physical infrastructure and human capital development. “Mr President’s “Renewed Hope” agenda is no longer a story; it’s a reality. It is a promise made and a promise fulfilled. “I think Mr. President has done very very well in terms of reassuring Nigerians that he is committed to deliver the dividend of democracy. “From what we have seen on the ground, there is really hope for Nigerians. “So, we are very happy.” He added that in FCT, Tinubu has rekindled the hope of civil servants by instituting their career progression “and I am sure the civil servants are happy”. The minister noted that although there were some areas that needed to be looked into, one year was not enough for Tinubu to deliver 100 per cent expectations of Nigerians. On the inauguration of the projects, Wike said: “We are good to go; just putting finishing touches. “We have been to the Southern Parkway, and we are 100 per cent ready. Here in the Metro Line, we are also ready. “We are happy that all our efforts have come to fruition. “The residents are very happy and by the end of the day, the train services will be available for Nigerians. “So, for us at FCTA, we are very very happy,” the minister said.

        "content": "An Israeli airstrike that caused a huge blaze at a tented area for displaced people in Rafah has killed 45 people, medics have said, with images of charred and dismembered children prompting an outcry from global leaders and putting ceasefire talks in jeopardy. Bombing overnight that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said targeted senior Hamas militants in a precision strike appears to have ignited fires that spread quickly through tents and makeshift accommodation, overwhelming a nearby field hospital operated by the International Committee of the Red Cross and overstretched local hospitals. “We pulled out people who were in an unbearable state,” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the north-western neighbourhood of Tel al-Sultan, told the Associated Press. “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal.” The health ministry in the Hamas-controlled area said about half of the dead were women, children and older adults. Barefooted children wandered around the smoking wreckage on Monday as searches for the dead continued and mourning families prepared to bury their loved ones. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in parliament that “something unfortunately went tragically wrong” with the airstrike. “We are investigating the incident and will reach conclusions, because this is our policy,” he said. The US, Israel’s staunchest ally and weapons supplier, described the images from the aftermath as devastating. The strike, one of the deadliest single incidents in the eight-month war to date, came two days after the international court of justice in The Hague, which arbitrates between states, ordered Israel to stop its operation in Rafah immediately . More than 85% of the Palestinian territory’s population had sought shelter in the area having fled fighting elsewhere, and a million people have been forced to move again since Israel’s ground operation began on 6 May. Israeli ground troops have so far probed Rafah’s southern and eastern outskirts, rather than its overcrowded centre. Aid deliveries have slowed to a trickle, with the Rafah and nearby Kerem Shalom crossings effectively blocked. International censure of Israel’s war against Hamas has grown steadily in tandem with the death toll and humanitarian crisis in the strip, but Israeli officials have vowed that a ground operation in Rafah, where it believes Hamas’s leadership and four battalions of fighters are camped out with Israeli hostages, is necessary for “total victory”. Friday’s order from the ICJ is binding, but not enforceable. Several countries called on Israel to obey the judges’s 13-2 majority decision in the wake of the Rafah strike. Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages, said the Rafah casualties would complicate the protracted negotiations. The Israeli daily Haaretz reported later on Monday that Hamas had decided to pull out of the latest proposed talks over what its senior leadership described as a massacre. Neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strike. Relations between Egypt and Israel, cool at the best of times, have reached a nadir since the Rafah operation began. The situation deteriorated further on Monday after the Israeli military confirmed there had been an exchange of fire between Israeli and Egyptian soldiers in the Rafah crossing area in which at least one member of Egypt’s security forces was killed. Both countries’ militaries are reviewing the incident. France, a European ally of Israel, said it was outraged by the Rafah strike. “These operations must stop,” the country’s president, Emmanuel Macron, posted on X. “There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire.” The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, posted: “Horrified by news coming out of Rafah on Israeli strikes killing dozens of displaced persons, including small children. I condemn this in the strongest terms.” Italy’s defence minister, Guido Crosetto, said that bombings such as Sunday night’s would have long-standing repercussions for Israel. Speaking to Sky TG24, he said: “Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision.” The head of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, said: “The state of Israel continues to violate international law with impunity and in contempt of an international court of justice ruling ... ordering an end to its military action in Rafah.” After criticism of the Rafah strike, the IDF said it had not anticipated civilian casualties, and had bombed an area outside the latest “evacuation zone” to where Palestinians have been ordered to move, although that claim appeared to contradict a previous “safe zone” map from 22 May. The bombing had killed Hamas’s chief of staff for the West Bank and another senior official responsible for deadly attacks on Israelis, the IDF said. Several rightwing Israeli journalists celebrated the attack in appearances on Israeli television and social media site X, likening it to this week’s Jewish bonfire festival, Lag B’Omer. Commentator Naveh Dromi retweeted another user’s post which also showed a fire in Rafah, adding her own: “Happy Holidays.” About 1,200 Israelis were killed and another 250 taken hostage in Hamas’s 7 October attack that triggered the latest conflict. According to the local health ministry, more than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory operation, which has left desperate civilians without healthcare, food or water and reduced most of the coastal territory to ruins. After a week in which Israel’s global standing had plummetted , Sunday’s attack attracted more attention than usual in the Hebrew-language media, which has often avoided daily reporting on the scenes of death and destruction in Gaza. Hostilities also flared on Israel’s northern border on Monday. Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah said it had launched a salvo of rockets at Israeli territory in response to a deadly Israeli strike outside a hospital in southern Lebanon earlier in the day. Israel has been locked in a battle of attrition with the Iranian-backed militia since 8 October, when Hezbollah began firing missiles at the Jewish state to aid Hamas. Several rightwing Israeli journalists celebrated the Rafah attack in appearances on Israeli television and Twitter, likening it to this week’s Jewish bonfire festival, Lag B’Omer.

        "content": "Listen to Story England white-ball skipper Jos Buttler is set to miss the third T20I against Pakistan with his wife Lousie expecting the birth of their third child. England will take on Pakistan in the third game of the four-match series on Tuesday, May 28 at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff. In Buttler’s absence, vice captain Moeen Ali will be seen leading the side as England look to seal the series in the upcoming encounter. Buttler guided his team to a 23-run win in the second T20I with a magnificent innings of 84 (51). The wicket keeper batter smashed eight fours and three sixes helping England score 183/7 batting first in their 20 overs. Following England’s win, the 33-year-old travelled back to his home in London and missed the training session on Monday afternoon ahead of the third T20I. His marvellous stroke play will be missed in the second game as decides to be along with his family on the joyous occasion for the couple. “Jos Buttler is set to miss our third IT20 match vs Pakistan as his wife Louise is expecting the birth of their third child Wishing Jos, Louise and the family all the best,” wrote England Cricket on their X account. Jos Buttler is set to miss our third IT20 match vs Pakistan as his wife Louise is expecting the birth of their third child ðèâðéâðçâðç Wishing Jos, Louise and the family all the best ð pic.twitter.com/5KRJ9xmMGT — England Cricket (@englandcricket) May 27, 2024 Buttler’s participation in the fourth T20I of the series is still under question. However, he’s expected to travel with the team to the Caribbean on May 31 for the T20 World Cup 2024. In his absence, Will Jacks or Ben Duckett is likely to open the innings alongside Phil Salt in the third T20I. Notably, Buttler left the Indian Premier League 2024 earlier this month along with other national teammates Salt, Jonny Bairstow and Sam Curran to prepare for the ongoing series which serves as the preparation for the upcoming T20 World Cup 2024. With England leading the series 1-0 after the first game got washed out, the hosts will look to close it out with a win in the third T20I as well and go into the World Cup on a winning note. The Three Lions are the defending champions of the upcoming event having won the tournament back in 2022 after beating Pakistan in the final. They’ve been placed in Group B alongside Australia, Namibia, Oman and Scotland against whom they will start their campaign on June 4 at Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados.",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 in what could be his last match at Roland Garros. It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has lost a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. The 14-time champion, known as the 'King of Clay', was roared on by family, friends and rivals at the scene of his greatest triumphs. Having returned to the tournament he skipped in 2023 and refused to confirm any farewells ahead of his opener, Nadal showed flashes of top form again on Court Philippe Chatrier but the 37-year-old ultimately went down fighting. A post shared by Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) 14 titles 112 victories 4 defeats 19 career Roland Garros appearances 96.5% wins 14 finals, 0 defeats 7 sets lost in final, 42 won Three 30+ win streaks 31 (2005-09), 33 (2017-21), 39 (2010-15) Nadal was persuaded afterwards by tournament director Amelie Mauresmo to say a few words to the crowd. \"I don't know if it's gonna be my last time here in front of you, not 100 per cent - but if it is I enjoyed it,\" he said. \"The feelings that I have are difficult to describe, it's so special to feel the love of the people in the place I love the most. How Nadal went down to defeat against Zverev... Murray remains proud of French Open legacy despite defeat French Open contenders and who will win at Roland Garros? Everything you need to know ahead of Roland Garros \"I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries and I went through a process with the dream of being back at Roland Garros. \"The first round was not the dream one but I was competitive and had my chances. It's difficult to say what's going on in the future, a big percentage that I won't be back but I can say 100 per cent I am enjoying playing and having fun. \"Maybe in two months I'll say it's enough, but it's something I don't want yet and I want to be back on this court for the Olympics. \"I never could imagine when I was a kid that I would be here at almost 38 with all the success I had here. I really hope to see you again - but I don't know.\" Victory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals. Nadal, the 22-time Grand Slam champion who won the Musketeers' Cup for the first time in 2005 and last raised the trophy in 2022 before a serious hip injury derailed his career, has previously said this year could be his final one on the tour. A post shared by Wimbledon (@wimbledon) A post shared by Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) The seats behind the players' boxes were crammed with current stars including Carlos Alcaraz - Nadal's heir apparent - long-time rival Novak Djokovic and women's No 1 and three-time champion Iga Swiatek. Also in attendance were Nadal's wife Xisca, who rarely watches his matches, baby son Rafael Jr and uncles Toni - his former coach - and Miguel Angel, the ex-Spain footballer. Manchester City midfielder Rodri, no stranger to titles himself, was another famous face in the crowd. Nadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavourable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain earlier. Nadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop. The crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two break points before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tie-break.

His celebrations were low key as Nadal sent a forehand wide on match point, before Chatrier rose, possibly for one last time, to salute their hero. Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, came into the French Open unseeded for the first time and saw his career record at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament fall to 112-4. His three other losses came against Soderling in 2010 and twice against Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. \"To be honest, I don't know what to say. First of all: thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,\" Zverev said. \"It's such a great honour. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. Today is not my moment. It's Rafa's moment.\" Italian world No 2 Jannik Sinner looked fully recovered from his injury problems as he saw off American Christopher Eubanks 6-3 6-3 6-4. Sinner, the Australian Open champion, withdrew from the Madrid Open and missed Rome with a hip injury, but was back on form at Roland Garros as Eubanks exited at the first hurdle for the second successive year. \"The hip is good, I'm glad that my team and myself, we were working very hard to be on court as soon as possible,\" Sinner said. \"For sure, the general shape is not at 100 per cent yet, so we try to build every day.\" The Italian broke twice in the opening set to lead 4-1 before Eubanks broke back but Sinner saw out the set with another break, and needed just one break in each of the next two sets to take his place in the second round. A post shared by Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) \"Honestly, I'm just happy to be back on court, I was injured, so I'm very happy to be back here,\" Sinner said. \"It's a very special tournament for me, it was the first time in a quarter-final of a grand slam, so I have some great memories.\" Djokovic, who returned to the top of the rankings in September, now needs to at least reach the final to have any chance of staying there. The 37-year-old Serb, who said he has \"low expectations and high hopes\" of defending his title in Paris, faces French wild card Pierre-Hugues Herbert in his first-round match on Tuesday.

        "content": "Jaraka: Ahead of Phase IV twin polls in Odisha, violence erupted at Dharmasala in Jajpur district on Monday afternoon, after a former Sarpanch drove his SUV into an election rally of the BJD, injuring four activists. According to reports, on Monday, BJD Dharmasala MLA candidate Pranab Kumar Balabantaray was campaigning in a bike procession on National Highway No. 53 in the Pakhara Panchayat. In the meanwhile, the former Sarpanch of Pakhara Panchayat, Dilip Behera, who was driving a Mahindra Scorpio, ran into the rally. As a result, four BJD activists were left injured on the spot. However, Behera managed to flee from the scene. In order to vent their anger, scores of people entered the market complex of Behera on Osara Chhak and resorted to vandalism. The mob ransacked Dilip’s office in the market complex and also broke the window glasses of four Hyvas, belonging to the ex-sarpanch. After Dharmasala Police, Jajpur Road SDPO, Jajpur SP Vinit Agarwal reached the spot with a platoon of police force, the mob dispersed soon after. “Strict action will be taken against whoever is found guilty in this incident... A platoon of police force has been deployed in the locality to maintain law & order and avoid any other untoward incident,” said Jajpur SP Vinit Agarwal.",

        "content": "Boxing legend Mike Tyson suffered a medical scare en route to Los Angeles, from Miami, prompting medical emergencies according to his representatives. It was reported that he became dizzy, prompting flight attendants to ask passengers if a doctor was on board to assist. Paramedics met the plane upon landing in Los Angeles and treated Tyson after a two-hour delay caused by Miami heat. His representative however said after the incident that the 57-year-old was now in good condition. “Thankfully, Mr. Tyson is doing great,”. The incident comes after initial reports surfaced on Monday morning alleging Tyson “had some kind of medical emergency on the plane and paramedics boarded.” Passengers on the flight claimed cabin crew requested a doctor 30 minutes before landing and the message appeared on passenger screens. An eyewitness described the scene: “He was in first class, but we were an exit row. They asked us to stay on the plane and landed so paramedics could enter. [The stewardess] said something like, ‘He’s a really important passenger so we wanna make sure he’s OK.’ I knew it was him, but I just mouthed the words ‘Mike Tyson’ and she nodded her head yes.” READ ALSO: Boxing legend Mike Tyson to face Jake Paul in exhibition fight The plane landed at LAX and experienced another delay of 25 minutes while paramedics treated Tyson. Tyson admitted to using marijuana daily and has reportedly stopped using the drug in preparation for the fight with Paul. He has also revealed he has temporarily given up sex as part of his training regimen. “He only stopped as a means of following all of the rules,” Tyson’s publicist recently told USA Today Sports. “But he is still a strong advocate for the medicinal benefits of cannabis for his well-being and others like him.” The fight between Tyson and Paul is set for AT&T Stadium in Dallas on July 20. The legendary boxer will be 58 on that night. “I don’t see too many people critical about it. Look at this,” Tyson said at a press conference earlier this month. “Who? Name me somebody. You? Who?” The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation has sanctioned the fight as a professional bout. Although it will be contested over eight two-minute rounds instead of the standard ten or twelve three-minute. The fight will also use heavier gloves (14 ounces instead of 10) to reduce the power of punches. Tyson retired from professional boxing in 2005. His most recent fight was an exhibition bout against Roy Jones Jr. in California in November 2020. You must be logged in to post a comment. Why are you flagging this comment?

        "content": "NBA Hall of Famer and broadcaster Bill Walton succumbed to cancer on Monday, the league announced. He was 71. “Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position,” NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a press release. “His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. “Bill then translated his infections enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events -- always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” In 468 career games in the NBA, Walton, a center, averaged 13.3 points per game and 10.5 rebounds. He played for the Portland Trail Blazers, San Diego/LA Clippers and Boston Celtics, winning two NBA crowns -- in 1976-77 season with Portland and then later with the Boston Celtics during the 1985-86 season. Walton played for John Wooden at UCLA, leading the school to NCAA championships in 1972 and 1973 and an 88-game winning streak.",

        "description": "\"I think it’s funny you said you were gonna make a 'proper cup' of tea and then almost instantly chose violence,\" one Englishman observed.",
        "content": "They’re royally tea’d off. A hapless American influencer’s disastrous attempt at making a “proper” cup of tea stirred up a real brew-haha that’s left Britons seething — with some even claiming to need “therapy” after witnessing the sacrilegious display. Kelsey Pomeroy, an eager Bridgerton fan hailing from Kansas, left the special relationship more than a little strained after sharing her tea travesty on Instagram. In a cringe-inducing video celebrating the third season of the hit Netflix show set in the U.K., Pomeroy told followers she would be making “the perfect cup of British tea” — only to fail spectacularly. Eyebrows shot up when Pomeroy mixed cold water and milk in a pot, boiling it into a frothy nightmare. One outraged Brit commented, “My eye is twitching with English rage.” “I am an American learning how to make a proper cup of British tea because I’m throwing a high tea party in honor of the Bridgerton premiere,” Kelsey said, addressing her 178,000 followers. “The internet told me to buy PG Tips and Yorkshire Gold. Someone said the perfect way is to boil the milk with the water first, then pour it on top of the tea and then add sugar. But no, I’ll put it in a pan,” she said. The Kansas mom left her British followers bewildered as she heated up her unheard of concoction. Looking puzzled, she asked, “How hot am I supposed to boil? Low and slow, or hot and high? I don’t know.” Kelsey then steeped a tea bag in a mug, pouring the milky mix over it, adding a spoonful of sugar. Unsure about the brewing time, she pondered, “One tea bag or two? The box says brew for one to two minutes, but I feel like the internet said at least three to four. Do I do one to two minutes or three to four minutes? ... I let the tea bag steep for three minutes.” Desperate for advice, she asked, “If you know how to make a proper cup of British tea, what should I change? Should I have boiled it in the kettle?” British social media users didn’t hold back in the comments. One joked, “Sending hate from the UK x,” while another fumed, “As a Brit I’m going to need an obscene amount of therapy to get over the boiling milk.” Another user quipped, “I think it’s funny you said you were gonna make a ‘proper cup’ of tea and then almost instantly chose violence.” A fourth exclaimed, “WHO TF TOLD THIS WOMAN TO BOIL THE MILK.” One even joked, “Genuinely think you may be banned from the UK for this.” For the actual perfect cup, legendary British tea merchant Fortnum & Mason suggests beginning with loose tea leaves, which are easily available at higher-end grocery stores in the U.S. You’ll also need a tea strainer — which can be found for a couple of bucks on Amazon . Once you’ve handled that, here are their specific instructions for making the perfect cup of British tea:",

The NHL fined the Rangers captain $5,000 for elbowing the Panthers’ Evan Rodrigues during the Blueshirts’ Game 3 overtime win in the Eastern Conference Final on Sunday, the league announced. The $5,000 is the maximum allowable under the collective bargaining agreement. Trouba elbowed Rodrigues high at 17:35 of the second period after slashing Sam Bennett, giving the Panthers a four-minute power play. Trouba elbows Rodrigues Rangers will have to kill off 4 minutes on both penalties committed by Trouba pic.twitter.com/7MUXHjBj7l But it was the Rangers who lit the lamp during that stretch, with Barclay Goodrow scoring shorthanded to give the Blurshirts a 4-2 lead on his second goal of the game and sixth of the playoffs. The play was controversial as some believed Trouba should’ve been assessed a major penalty for the hit. Panthers coach Paul Maurice mocked the fine on Monday. “Take the hat, pass it around. Poor lad. Poor Jake,” Maurice told reporters . “He won’t be able to eat.” The Panthers scored twice in the third to force overtime before Alex Wennberg won it for the Rangers with his first goal of the postseason, giving the Blueshirts a 2-1 series lead. Trouba, who also committed a holding penalty in the third period, has 20 penalty minutes in 13 games this postseason. Game 4 is Tuesday at 8 p.m.",

        "content": "According to the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, governance is “the process of decision-making and the process by which decisions are implemented (or not implemented). Governance can be used in several contexts such as corporate governance, international governance, national governance and local governance.” In the opinion of UNESCAP, “Good governance has eight major characteristics. It is participatory, consensus-oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective and efficient, equitable and inclusive and follows the rule of law. It assures that corruption is minimised, the views of minorities are taken into account and that the voices of the most vulnerable in society are heard in decision-making. It is also responsive to the present and future needs of society.” In Nigeria, the governance structure is such that there are 11,082 elective political offices comprised of the seat of the president, 36 state governors, 109 senators, 360 members of the House of Representatives, 993 state Houses of Assembly members, 768 local government chairpersons, six area council chairmen and 8,809 councillors representing each of the political wards in the country. This calculation deliberately left out the positions of vice president, deputy governors and vice chairmen of local government and area councils because they are not stand-alone positions. As a notable Nigerian politician jokingly said, they are ‘spare tyres.’ Note also that there are three tiers and three arms of government in Nigeria. The three tiers are the federal, state and local government; while the three arms are the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. These tiers and arms draw their funding largely from the federal purse as laid down by law. While the arms of government receive their funding annually through the federal budget, the states and local governments draw their funding monthly through the Federation Account Allocation Committee. The three arms of government are governed by the principles of separation of powers as well as checks and balances. It is very simplistic and naïve to blame the President for bad governance and incompetence without taking into cognisance that he is not the sole administrator of the country. It is true that Nigeria has an executive president deemed to be among the most powerful individuals in the world, however, he is merely a superintendent. To succeed, he needs the collaboration and support of his lieutenants. His aides whether they are ministers or heads of Ministries, Departments and Agencies must cooperate with him in order to succeed in delivering the dividends of democracy. The public servants must play their roles nobly as the engine room of the government’s bureaucracy. While it is true that the president can hire and fire, he must use his presidential powers with utmost discretion in order to avoid sabotage. A president must have eyes for details, be alive to his responsibilities and have an independent way of getting information about the public mood without excessively relying on his advisers many of whom will only tell him what he wants to hear and not what he needs to hear. For there to be good governance, the local government chairpersons and the governors must be conscientious and selfless in the performance of their duties. Personal aggrandisement should not be the sole purpose of being in government. Nigeria suffers from underdevelopment today because our political leaders across the board see their offices as avenues for corrupt enrichment and opportunities to feather their own nests. This is not in sync with the principle of good governance. If we use the eight characteristics of good governance as espoused by UNESCAP, namely – participatory, consensus-oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective and efficient, equitable and inclusive, how are Nigerian political leaders going to fare? Do our leaders believe in the rule of law or the rule of thumb? How much allegiance do our leaders hold to the constitution of the country? There is a provision for the federal character principle in sections 14 (3) and (4) of the 1999 Constitution. Unfortunately, this principle meant to cement national cohesion and national loyalty is observed in the breach. Appointments into civil service and even leadership of MDAs often do not follow the federal character principle. How transparent and accountable are our political leaders? The budgeting process in many states is shrouded in secrecy. Unlike the federal budget that is online, only members of the state Houses of Assembly get to see the budget of many states. In Rivers State, the N800bn budget of the government for this year was presented to a four-member Assembly who returned it to Governor Siminalayi Fubara the following day for his signature. What a mockery of due process! Most local governments do not even have annual budgets; the local council, which is supposed to be the legislative arm, hardly meets. In fact, not a few people believe that local government is virtually non-existent in Nigeria as their roles have been taken over by the state government. Do we have participatory and inclusive governance in Nigeria? If we do, why are the vulnerable groups viz. – women, youths and persons with disability, underrepresented in the governance system of the country? The National Gender Policy of Nigeria stated 35 per cent slot for women in appointive positions but none of the tiers of government have paid due attention to that. Not even President Bola Tinubu has up to 20 per cent of women in his 48-member cabinet. There are only nine women in his cabinet with one of them, Dr. Beta Edu, suspended since the beginning of the year. There are about 11 under-50-year-olds in Tinubu’s cabinet of 48 members. As for PWDs, they don’t even have any seat at the table of the president. He only appointed a Senior Special Assistant. Not a single member of his cabinet is a PWD. This same nonchalance to the marginalised groups is replicated across the three tiers and three arms of government. How then can you claim you’re running a participatory and inclusive government? Ensuring good governance is not the responsibility of only the people holding political offices. Citizens too have a role to play. We should stop placing a heavy financial burden on political office holders. You cannot have your cake and eat it. You can’t be going to politicians for ‘chop’ money and asking them for stomach infrastructure and expect them not to steal to meet your insatiable demands. The reason many lawmakers don’t like to go to their constituency offices is due to heavy financial demands on them by their constituents who want them to send them on holy pilgrimage, help them pay school fees, bankroll the funeral of their dead parents and pay their hospital bills, among others. We’re not talking of a few individuals here but hundreds of people. Failure to meet this need gets the legislature into the black book of the constituents who will promise to punish him or her at the next election. Citizens should also pay their taxes and levies, stop vandalising government or public utilities and generally be law-abiding. It is all these collaborative efforts that will lead to good governance which has become a buzzword.",

        "content": "With the closing arguments set for Tuesday in the trial of former president Donald Trump, defense counsel are in a rather curious position. There is still debate among legal experts as to the specific crime that District Attorney Alvin Bragg is alleging. Trump’s lawyers are defending a former president who is charged under a state misdemeanor which died years ago under the statute of limitations. It was then zapped back into life in the form of roughly three dozen felonies by claiming that bookkeeping violations — allegedly hiding payments to Stormy Daniels to ensure her silence about a supposed affair with Trump — were committed to hide another crime. But what is that second crime? Even liberal legal analysts admitted that they could not figure out what was being alleged in Bragg’s indictment. Now, after weeks of trial, the situation has changed little. Originally, Bragg referenced four possible crimes, though is now claiming three: a tax violation or either a state or federal campaign financing violation. The last crime is particularly controversial because Bragg has no authority to enforce federal law and the Justice Department declined any criminal charge. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) did not even find grounds for a civil fine. Judge Merchan has ruled that the jury does not have to agree on what that crime is. The jury could split into three groups of four on which of the three crimes were being concealed and Merchan will still treat it as a unanimous verdict. The jury has been given little substantive information on these crimes, and Merchan has denied a legal expert who could have shown that there was no federal election violation. This case should have been dismissed for lack of evidence or a cognizable crime. The jury will be reminded that the burden is on the government, not the defense. However, the presumption of innocence is often hard to discern in criminal cases. Most jurors believe that clients are sitting behind the defense table for a reason. That is why many prosecution offices have conviction rates in the 80%-90% range. That presumption is even more difficult to discern when the defendant is named Trump and the jury sits in Manhattan. A classic closing pitch by lawyers is to use a physical object like a three-legged stool. If any leg is missing, the stool collapses. In this case, the government needs to show that there was a falsification of business records, that the records were falsified to conceal another crime and that Donald Trump had the specific intent to use such “unlawful means” to influence the election. Even a cursory review of the evidence shows this case does not have a leg to stand on. Subscribe to our daily Post Opinion newsletter! Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy . Never miss a story. The dead misdemeanor that is the foundation for this entire prosecution requires the falsification of business records. It is not clear that there was such falsification or that Trump has any knowledge or role in any falsification. Witnesses testified that Trump would sign checks prepared by others and that the specific checks in this case were signed while Trump was serving as president. Some of these checks, labeled “legal expenses,” were allegedly for attorney Michael Cohen to pay off Stormy Daniels. Most importantly, Jeffrey McConney, the Trump Organization’s retired controller and senior vice-president, testified that it was not Trump who designated these payments as “legal expenses.” Rather, the corporation used an “antiquated” drop-down menu where any payments to lawyers were designated “legal expenses.” There is a plausible reason why payments to an attorney were listed as legal expenses. The government also cites the designation of payments to Cohen as part of his “retainer,” which included reimbursement for the payment of the Daniels non-disclosure agreement. However, that designation was the result of discussions between Cohen and former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg, who is sitting in a jail cell in New York City. The government could have called Weisselberg, but did not. The government has made a big deal over the fact that retainer agreements are supposed to have written contracts. However, that was the failure of Cohen, who was later disbarred as an attorney. For a businessman like Weisselberg, monthly payments to an attorney could have seemed perfectly logical. Once again, there was no evidence that Trump knew of how the payments were denoted. The government must also show that any falsification was done to further or conceal another crime. This is where the defense needs to bring greater clarity to its own narrative. Trump’s team needs to drive home that a non-disclosure agreement is common in political, business and entertainment circles. The payment of money to quash a story before an election is neither unlawful nor unusual. Indeed, Keith Davidson, Stormy Daniels’ attorney, described the NDA as routine and said that it was not hush money but a simple contractual transaction: “It wasn’t a payoff. It wasn’t hush money. It was consideration.” This is where the testimony of David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Inquirer, was particularly damaging to the government. Pecker detailed how killing such stories was a common practice at the National Inquirer and that he had done so for Trump for over a decade before he ran for president. He also killed stories for an impressive list of other celebrities, including Tiger Woods, Mark Wahlberg, Rahm Emanuel and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Mechan has allowed the jury to repeatedly hear of “election violations,” while blocking a legal expert to explain that there is no federal election law violation. The payment of hush money is not a campaign contribution and, again, the federal government not only declined to bring any criminal charge, but found no basis for even a civil fine. Had he been allowed to testify, Bradley Smith, the former Federal Election Commission (FEC) chairman, would have explained that, even if it were a campaign contribution, it would not have been needed to be filed until after the election — demolishing the notion that this was an effort to influence an election that would have run before any filing had to be made. The defense has to hammer away on the fact that no one has testified that it was a federal campaign violation. Various witnesses, including former Trump aide Hope Hicks, testified that Trump was motivated to protect his family from embarrassment. She recounted how Trump even “wanted me to make sure the newspapers weren’t delivered to their residence that morning.” Pecker testified that he previously killed stories about Trump going back over a decade. That included stories that were demonstrably untrue, such as a claim of a doorman that he fathered a child out of wedlock. In addition to being a married man, Trump was the host of a major television program subject to a scandal clause. He was also an international businessman. Given all of those interests, it is impossible to claim absolutely that the campaign was the reason for the NDA, which was chump change for a billionaire. The government spent considerable time proving facts not in dispute. There is no dispute that there was a NDA or that Trump signed checks on these payments. It is like repeatedly telling a court that a driver drove 55 miles an hour down a highway and elected to change lanes with a signal. The intent is to convince the jury that somehow proving that an NDA was paid and that an affair occurred is proof of an offense. It is not. The supervisor in charge of processing payments said that permission to cut Cohen’s checks came not from Trump, but from Weisselberg and McConney. Trump’s White House secretary, Madeleine Westerhout, testified that it was common for Trump to sign checks in the White House without reviewing them. The entire basis for the alleged criminal intent is Michael Cohen, a disbarred lawyer and serial perjurer. Yet even Cohen did not offer a clear basis for showing a criminal intent to use unlawful means to influence the election. Everything Cohen described could be true and only show a desire to kill an embarrassing story before an election — again, not a crime. Cohen described the mechanics on the payments, but the only person who discussed these payments in detail with Cohen was Weisselberg. Even liberal experts on CNN admitted that Cohen was trashed on the stand. The only crime that was clearly established in his trial was the grand larceny that Cohen admitted to under oath (after the statute of limitations had run out). Cohen said that he stole tens of thousands from the Trump corporation, a crime far more serious than the dead misdemeanor or even the felonies alleged against Trump. However, the most significant testimony by Cohen may be his latest alleged perjury in front of the jury. Many of us guffawed when Cohen claimed that he secretly taped Trump to protect him and keep Pecker honest. No one can explain how that could possibly be true. If it were, he would have told Trump. There is nothing in the call that would have any impact on Pecker, and Cohen admitted to regularly taping others without telling them. Another alleged perjury came with the key telephone call in which Cohen claimed Trump was informed that the Daniels deal was concluded. The defense showed that that 96-second-long call was to Trump’s bodyguard, Keith Schiller, in late October 2016. It was preceded and followed by text messages that clearly shows that the conversation was about a teenager harassing Cohen, not the NDA. Other witnesses trashed Cohen as unprofessional, prone to exaggeration, bitter against Trump, at times suicidal over being denied positions like attorney general and simply “a jerk.” Hope Hicks, a former aide to Trump, said that Cohen “used to like to call himself Mister Fix It, but it was only because he first broke it.” Those were the government’s witnesses. Cohen’s lack of credibility and his admitted financial interest in attacking Trump only highlight again the absence of Weisselberg, whom Cohen references repeatedly as the key person making decisions on how these payments were made and described. If what Cohen said was true, corroboration was sitting a car ride away in Rikers Island. Traffic may be bad but it is not that bad. The only reason not to call Weisselberg was that he would contradict Cohen. The prosecution preferred to use a serial perjurer who roughly half of the country views as dishonest as almost the entirety of their case. Even beyond Weisselberg, there is no corroboration for Cohen’s vague allegations on the record. In the end, this three-legged stool is the very thing that all of us must stand on when accused. Who on the jury would want to stand on this stool with their own liberty at stake? In the end, the defense needs to be honest with these jurors. The question is whether hatred for this man is enough to ignore the obvious injustice in this case. They may have come to this case with little doubt about Donald Trump, but the question is whether there is not any reasonable doubt about the crimes alleged against him. In the end, we are all standing on that wobbly stool when the government seeks to convict people without evidence or even a clear crime. If we allow a conviction, it is more than a stool that will collapse in this Manhattan courtroom. Jonathan Turley is an attorney and professor at George Washington University Law School.",

        "content": "While Ottawa seeks to deliver a national strategy aimed at curbing auto theft and subsequent vehicle exports, police in Saskatchewan say when it comes to stolen vehicles in the province, few are being resold. Further details were provided on the federal government’s plan last month which gathered representation from police agencies, provinces, municipalities and other partners across the country. The Liberal government proposed Criminal Code amendments and reserved $28 million in its federal budget to prevent theft. Approximately 90,000 vehicles were stolen in Canada last year, the conference heard. In a statement the Saskatchewan Chiefs of Police said to date they have not received any additional mandates from Ottawa on stolen vehicles but “welcome any renewed efforts provincially or nationally.” Mitch Yuzdepski, the executive director for the Saskatchewan Association of Chiefs of Police said auto theft presents differently in the Prairies. “Our experience in Saskatchewan is quite different than what has been an issue in Ontario, Quebec and B.C. where high-end vehicles have been stolen and shipped abroad,” Yuzdepski said in an email to paNOW . A third of stolen vehicles in the province are the result of keys being left inside the vehicle, he said, noting many cars are recovered locally. Anecdotally, many of the stolen vehicles in Saskatchewan are used for joyriding, dangerous driving or being used in conjunction with another criminal offence, such as break and enter. SGI’s spokesperson Tyler McMurchy cited a former colleague of his: “when you have stolen vehicles, there are almost always guns and/or drugs,” he wrote in an email. The province received 3,404 insurance claims for stolen vehicles last year, a decrease from last year’s 3,597 although not every theft results in an insurance claim, McMurchy said. Prince Albert Police Chief Patrick Nogier noted Prince Albert’s statistics are in line with other cities. “The context of the theft differs when compared to other areas of the country,” he said. “Anecdotally we don’t see a huge number of stolen vehicles making their way to the used market.” Nogier said PA Police does not have a unit dedicated to stolen vehicles, nor the analytics to determine whether there were exports. Last year officers responded to 495 stolen vehicle files, which was a nearly seven per cent increase from 2022. Nogier said the more alarming statistic front line officers face is roughly 80 per cent of cases in which drivers failed to stop for a police officer involved stolen vehicles. The upshot is thefts are trending downward for the police service and while prevention efforts continue, Nogier said the primary focus is reducing the threat to the public when thieves drive dangerously. —With files from the Canadian Press — glynn.brothen@pattisonmedia.com",

        "description": "Bill Walton, who helped UCLA win national titles during John Wooden's career and later won two NBA titles, has died following a cancer battle.",
        "content": "Bill Walton, a UCLA basketball legend who became an NBA star and an outspoken advocate for the virtues of the Pac-12 conference as a broadcaster, died Monday at the age of 71 following a prolonged cancer battle. The NBA announced Walton’s death, launching a series of tributes to the gregarious La Mesa, Calif., native who was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame and National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. “Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams,” NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. “Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton grew up listening to UCLA basketball radio broadcasts and quickly committed to joining the Bruins despite numerous other scholarship offers. His laid-back approach to life clashed at times with Wooden, but Walton called the legendary UCLA coach his lifelong mentor and friend. Freshmen were not allowed to play on the varsity squad during Walton’s college career. He was the Bruins’ starting center for three seasons (1972-74), playing on UCLA’s only varsity teams to record back-to-back 30-0 seasons in 1972 and 1973. He led UCLA to back-to-back NCAA titles as a sophomore and junior (1972 and 1973). “On behalf of everyone with the UCLA men’s basketball program, we are deeply saddened to learn of Bill Walton’s passing,” Bruins coach Mick Cronin said in a statement. “... It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball. Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories, and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind, and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Following his NBA career, Walton became a star broadcaster known for his high-energy commentary and frequent tributes to the Grateful Dead. He was an unabashed cheerleader for his alma mater and the Pac-12 conference, which he tirelessly referred to as the “Conference of Champions.” He lamented UCLA and USC leading teams defecting from the Pac-12 in search of greater financial stability. The Pac-12 hosted its final event, the conference baseball tournament championship game, during the weekend. Walton was surrounded by his family when he died. He is survived by his wife, Lori; his sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris; and extended family. Check back soon for updates on this developing news story.",

        "content": "Brisbane legend Jason Akermanis has challenged 2017 No.1 draft pick Cam Rayner to finally deliver on his potential as the Lions claw to salvage their season. After a promising three weeks, the Lions came crashing back to earth on Sunday with a 25-point defeat to bogey team Hawthorn - their fifth-straight loss against the Hawks. It has left the Lions reeling in 12th with a 4-6-1 record heading into the bye after making last year's grand final. Rayner had just seven possessions against Hawthorn - only touching the ball more than sub Harry Sharp and tall Brandon Ryan, who was making his Lions debut. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. That quiet performance came just six weeks after Rayner produced arguably the best game of his career in a match-winning midfield turn in an upset of Melbourne at the MCG. Since being heralded for what shaped as a breakout game, the 24-year-old has again slipped back into inconsistency. \"Cam Rayner, he's an incredible player, but he hasn't really produced now he's in his seventh season,\" Akermanis told AAP. \"He's really due to play way better footy. \"More in the midfield, 20 plus possessions and a couple of shots on goal (a game) and he's just not even doing any of that - win, lose or draw. \"You watch a guy like (West Coast's No.1 draft pick) Harley Reid in his first year play incredibly well at home. \"For Cam there's not really a reason, unless he's injured and we don't know about it.\" Akermanis played tagging roles in defence and in the midfield before he became a Brownlow medallist and a genuine superstar of the AFL in 2001 when the Lions won the first of three-straight premierships. The Australian Football Hall of Famer suggested the Lions try something similar with Rayner to boost his output. \"Unless you're a natural ball-winner, which he he doesn't really seem to be a guy that accumulates and gets in the right spots, like other players who play midfield all the time,\" Akermanis said. \"He's not getting anywhere near the ball so let's put him in a spot, whether he tags straight out in the midfield and learns where to run and how to run on good players who can take him near the ball.\" Despite the Lions staring at missing the finals for the first time since 2018, Akermanis insists the future is bright for Brisbane and they could use the second half of the season as a springboard into 2025. The Lions have been hit hard by injury with five players - Will Ashcroft, Keidean Coleman, Tom Doedee, Lincoln McCarthy and Darcy Gardiner - sidelined with long-term knee issues. \"The younger guys are getting a taste, where they've just been denied for the last number of years,\" said Akermanis, adding there was \"so much to like\" amongst the Lions' group of less experienced players. \"If I was Chris (Fagan) I would keep working on the six, seven role players you need, to keep them hungry. \"Get them playing a brand that is slightly different to what it is now - even though when they play it well, it works - but the tweaks that they need.\"",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, . Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” The following has been released by the NBA. — NBA Communications (@NBAPR) Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.”",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family.

For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA Tim Reynolds, The Associated Press",

        "content": "Jeopardy! fans stunned by rule shake-up that allows four-day winner Grant DeYoung to compete in Tournament of Champions DeYoung enjoyed a winning streak last week on the beloved game show Host Ken Jennings hinted that he would return for Tournament of Champions However, fan argued that contestants needed to have at least five wins streak By Nola Ojomu For Dailymail.Com Published: 13:22 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 13:37 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 10 shares 1 View comments Jeopardy! viewers were left puzzled by an apparent shake-up in the show's rules after it was hinted that four-day winner Grant DeYoung would likely be taking part in the next Tournament of Champions. DeYoung, who works as a grocery store clerk, thrilled viewers with a four-day winning streak earlier this month - which officially came to an end on May 21 after he racked up a $81,203 haul. Host Ken Jennings then told DeYoung that 'with your four wins I think that it is very likely that we will be seeing you in the Tournament of Champions.' This raised several eyebrows of fans who believed that the Arizona native couldn't take part due to the fact he had failed to reach the usual requirement of five consecutive wins. Viewers soon took to social media to question how DeYoung would be allowed to take part despite not meeting the necessary number of wins. Jeopardy! viewers were left puzzled by a shake-up in the show's rules for eligibility that would allow contestant Grant DeYoung (pictured) to take part in the Tournament of Champions It was hinted by host Ken Jennings (pictured) that the four-day winner would likely be taking part in the next Tournament of Champions Read More Jeopardy! contestant leaves host Ken Jennings STUNNED with shock on-air confession about the moment he learned he had landed a spot on the hit game show When one fan commented on Instagram, 'Why will he be back? I thought 5 wins for toc (Tournament of Champions)?' To which another replied: 'All 4 game champions were eventually qualified at TOC in the last 3 editions.' They then added: 'With a shorter eligibility window and the expansion of TOC field in the last 2 editions. I think Grant might get in the 32nd TOC. 'Since 2021 TOC where all 4 game champions competed, some of them made it to the semifinals like: Veronica, Ryan B, Ryan H, Maureen, John & David.' Another fan stated that they hoped DeYoung would get the chance to compete as they wrote: 'I hope so. They brought back Yogesh and I think he only won a couple of games.' The last tournament in March saw Yogesh Raut, Ben Chan, and Troy Meyer battle it out in the finals, with Raut being crowed the winner. It wasn't the only rule that DeYoung has ended up revealing to viewers during his run on the show, as many fans were also shocked by the fact that contestants could use chairs. Throughout the rounds he participated in, eagle-eyed viewers spotted that DeYoung was seated in a chair , which is a rarity on the show, with most competitors opting to stand behind their podiums. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jeopardy! (@jeopardy) Fans believed that the Arizona native couldn't take part due to the fact he had failed to reach the usual requirement of five consecutive wins - but that has not been the case recently Another fan explained that 'they brought back Yogesh and I think he only won a couple of games' highlighting a recent change in the rules In a podcast Inside Jeopardy!, producer Sarah Whitcomb explained why Grant was seated rather than standing - revealing all contestants have the option. 'Fans have been noticing that Grant is sitting in a chair during his games. This is something that we always offer to contestants,' she shared. She added: 'We don't ask why. It's not our business. If you want a chair, we'll give it to you... So there you have it!' DeYoung was sitting on a black swivel chair that was adjusted up to the same standing height as the others, allowing him to see out over the podium. In the Jeopardy! subreddit from last week, a curious viewer asked why the contestant was in a chair. 'They give it if you ask - I have some back arthritis that makes standing still for that long very difficult,' DeYoung explained in a comment in the discussion thread. 'I wouldn't expect everyone who sits for Jeopardy! to disclose their reason for needing one but I don't mind saying mine.' While he appeared on the show, DeYoung also revealed he was hit by a car after learning he had made it onto the hit ABC show - but he was so excited he didn't even notice. It wasn't the only rule that DeYoung has ended up revealing to viewers during his run on the show Many fans were shocked by the fact that contestants could use chairs, and DeYoung explained that he suffered from 'back arthritis that makes standing still for that long very difficult' The grocery clerk, who hails from Prescott, Arizona, revealed that he was involved in a road traffic accident at the exact moment he received a text message confirming the news. 'I got off work and got in the car and pulled my phone out and it was sinking in,' he recalled on Wednesday night's show. 'I'm on the verge of tears there staring down at it, and I got hit and ran....' A stunned Ken asked: 'A car hit you while you were getting the text?' 'I had people coming up to me after [saying]: \"Are you aware you just got your car hit?\" and I was like \"no\" holding my phone and staring at the message.' Ken then asked whether he was doing okay. 'The car needs some work but I'm certainly fine, thank you,' Grant said. Earlier in May it was announced that a Jeopardy! spinoff was coming to Amazon Prime and it would give the web-obsessed a chance to test their knowledge. Pop Culture Jeopardy! marks the first time that the brainy series, which was created by Sony Pictures Television's game show division, will hit a streaming service. It will mimic the set up of the original game show - but the question segment will focus on music, films, TV shows, sports, and more.

The untreated raw sewage came from Plano, a rich suburb north of Dallas, and it turns out, this wasn't the first time. Plano's sewage has ended up in the Texas lake 30 times in the last seven years, according to environmental records obtained by D Magazine . With such a disgusting track record, the City of Dallas is considering suing Plano, best known as home to posh soccer moms with $1,000 baby strollers and major corporate headquarters (Toyota Motor North America, JC Penney and Frito Lay [PepsiCo] to name a few.) 'Same sh**, different day,' Paula Blackmon, the Dallas council representative for White Rock Lake told the magazine. White Rock Lake, where over one millions gallons of untreated sewage have been dumped over the last seven years, is popular with Dallas crowds in the summer 'They [Plano] are aware that we [Dallas] are not happy and that they need to stop. I did call Plano myself and talked to [Director of Policy and Government Relations] Andrew Fortune. They need to get their stuff working. 'B****ing and yelling from the highest mountain isn’t going to solve the problem. They need to fix their infrastructure.' The Dallas official added there were other conversations that happened in executive session regarding the matter, but she couldn't speak about them publicly. The latest spill happened March 14 when a valve at a Plano waste water facility failed, according to Dallas Morning News . It flooded the station and overflowed into a creek that empties in White Rock Lake- some 30 miles south. For 38 hours, brown water gushed into the lake, with an estimated 500 gallons of sewage per minute flowing in. A waste water treatment plant in Plano has repeatedly been the source of sewage leaks into a lake downstream in Dallas White Rock Lake is a popular outdoor venue in East Dallas, surrounded by multi-million dollar homes When the water was tested on March 21, high levels of E. coli were still detected, although it wasn't clear how bad the contamination was. Water sports and other recreational activities were suspended until a clean-up effort or chlorine tablets and clean waster were added to the lake to return the water to safe levels. It's unclear whether the City of Plano has been fined for this or any of its previous sewer spills. In November 2021 more than 320,000 gallons of sewage spilled into the creek after a storm damaged a sewage line. In June 2018, recreational activities at White Rock Lake were also suspended after 1 million gallons of feces water escaped into the lake-- blamed on a broken pipe in Plano. In that case, the contractor breaking the pipe was fine $7,500, according to the local paper. For its part, the City of Plano claims it is replacing old sewer pipes and making improvements to facilities. After sewage leaks into White Rock Lake, outdoor recreational activities have been suspended until water levels are safe E.Coli Texas Share or comment on this article: Texas city at war with nearby small town that's been dumping sewage into popular tourist lake for seven years e-mail Add comment",

        "content": "Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory used additive manufacturing to produce the first defect-free complex tungsten parts for use in extreme environments. The accomplishment could have positive implications for clean-energy technologies such as fusion energy. Tungsten has the highest melting point of any metal, making it ideal for fusion reactors where plasma temperatures exceed 180 million degrees Fahrenheit. In comparison, the sun's center is about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit. In its pure form, tungsten is brittle at room temperature and easily shatters. To counter this, ORNL researchers developed an electron-beam 3D-printer to deposit tungsten, layer by layer, into precise three-dimensional shapes. This technology uses a magnetically directed stream of particles in a high-vacuum enclosure to melt and bind metal powder into a solid-metal object. The vacuum environment reduces foreign material contamination and residual stress formation. \"Electron-beam is promising for the processing of complex tungsten geometries,\" said ORNL's Michael Kirka. \"This is an important step for expanding the use of temperature-resistant metals in that will support a sustainable, carbon-free future.\"",

        "description": "An Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah killed at least 45 people, according to local officials.",
        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local officials. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas, with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel's military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. Video below: Why are war crimes hard to prosecute? In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from some of Israel's close allies. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto, in a TV interview, said such bombings are “spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren.” Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strike. Egypt's Foreign Ministry called it a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine.",

        "content": "Photo: District of Coldstream Construction on Rotary Pier in Coldstream has been pushed back. Mayor Ruth Hoyte told Castanet in January that work on the pier was ready to begin this summer as long as provincial permits came through in a timely manner. An update to Coldstream Council ahead of its meeting Monday says work will now begin in the fall. “Archaeological (land disturbance) permits are approved. The environmental permit is expected shortly, with construction expected to begin mid-September,” reads the update. “In the interim, Parks continues to monitor the pier and ensure it remains safe for use.” In January 2023 council heard the pier could collapse in five years. Castanet asked the Ministry of Forests for a status update on permits in January. The ministry was unable to provide a timeline at the time, but said it continued to work with the district. \"The Ministry of Forests’ Archaeology Branch administers the Heritage Conservation Act (HCA) and applications for permits to identify, investigate and/or alter heritage sites across British Columbia, in compliance with the HCA,\" said the ministry in an email. \"The Archaeology Branch is consulting with all affected First Nations on the proposed Rotary Pier Heritage inspection and alteration permits that were submitted to the Province.\"",

        "content": "Pitcher Zach Penrod was promoted from the Double-A Portland Sea Dogs to Triple-A Worcester. Shawn Patrick Ouellette/Staff Photographer The Red Sox promoted left-handed starting pitching prospect Zach Penrod to Triple-A Worcester after he dominated at Double-A for the Portland Sea Dogs. Penrod made seven starts for Portland. He went 4-0 with a 2.80 ERA, 1.02 WHIP, 53 strikeouts and 13 walks in 35 1/3 innings. Opponents batted .183 against him. He averaged 13.5 strikeouts and 3.3 walks per nine innings. Penrod is an interesting pitcher to keep an eye as someone who could make his big league debut this year. Boston signed him out of the independent Pioneer League last Aug. 16. He went on to post a 2.18 ERA (20 2/3 innings, five earned runs) in four regular season starts for High-A Greenville, then made four starts for Glendale in the Arizona Fall League. He led all AFL starters in ERA (1.29). The 26-year-old throws a 94-97 mph fastball, 85-89 mph power slider and changeup. On his journey to signing with the Red Sox, he laid floors with his dad and paid for his own MRI. Texas initially signed him as a non-drafted free agent in 2018. But he missed the 2019 season because he underwent Tommy John surgery in April 2019 and the Rangers released him June 1, 2020. At the time, many minor leaguers throughout the league were released due to the COVID shutdown. Success. Please wait for the page to reload.

        "content": "Time is running out to find survivors of a huge landslide that buried many hundreds of people in a remote Papua New Guinea village as Australia prepares a $2.5 million aid package to assist. PNG's National Disaster Centre said more than 2000 people had been buried alive by Friday's landslide in remote Enga province. Australia will send technical experts and $2.5 million in initial aid to PNG as the death toll continues to rise following the catastrophic landslide.

Australia is ready to consider additional support beyond Monday's announcement, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said. \"(This) package will assist the urgent needs of those affected by this devastating landslide,\" she said. The head of the International Organisation for Migration in PNG Serhan Aktoprak said the conditions on the ground were hampering rescue and aid efforts.

A spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the reported loss of hundreds of lives. \"He extends his heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and expresses his solidarity with the people and government of Papua New Guinea,\" the spokesperson said. \"The United Nations and its partners are supporting the government's response efforts.",

        "content": "A rapid-fire probe into gendered-violence prevention has been launched following a sharp rise in the number of women killed this year. A team of experts on gender-based violence, social policy, diversity and inclusion, men's mental health and the justice system has been assembled to offer practical advice to the federal government. The first part of the research will be completed by the end of June. A number of high-profile cases involving women who were killed by men they knew has sparked public outcry and put the government under pressure to do more. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Social Services Minister Amanda Rishworth said one life lost to intimate partner homicide was one too many. \"In order to reach our shared goal of ending violence against women and children in one generation we must have a considered focus on perpetrator intervention and prevention activities,\" she said in a statement. Labor has promised to end violence against women and children in one generation. The newly-assembled panel will consider all opportunities to intervene and prevent incidents, including \"stronger accountability and consequences for people who choose to use violence\". Shifting attitudes and accelerating that process will also be investigated. Australia's Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence Commissioner Micaela Cronin, Commonwealth Office for Women executive director Padma Raman and Department of Social Services secretary Ray Griggs will co-convene the panel. Leigh Gassner, assistant commissioner at Victoria Police, will also be on the panel, as will journalist and coercive control educator Jess Hill, along with other experts from relevant fields. In Australia, one-in-five women and one-in-16 men have experienced sexual violence since the age of 15. Women were most likely to experience harm at the hands of an intimate partner. National cabinet held an emergency meeting earlier in May on domestic violence prevention. Following the meeting, the government pledged more than $900 million to make permanent a program to provide one-off $5000 payments to women fleeing violence. 1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732) Lifeline 13 11 14",

        "content": "After a lengthy delay, Android’s Find My Device network is finally here and, with it, AirTag-like trackers for Android. As shipping begins, we’ve just had a chance to set up Chipolo’s new One Point and One Card trackers for the Android Find My Device network – here’s how they work. What’s in the box with Chipolo One Point and Card? Chipolo sells two trackers compatible with the Android Find My Device network. The first is the One Point , a device similar in design and size to Apple’s AirTag. The other is the One Card , which is a thin device similar in size to a credit card. It’s designed to fit in a wallet. Both trackers ship in small, colorful packages. After removing a sticker, you can slide the inner portion out and then pull out the tracker itself. There are instructions printed on the packaging as well as a small user manual in the back. These include setup assistance, troubleshooting, warranty information, and, in the case of the Point, information on how to replace the battery. You can’t replace the battery on the One Card, but there is a discount code in the box for a 50% off replacement when the battery wears out after “at least” two years. Both devices come with a 2-year warranty. How to set up Chipolo tracker with Android Find My Device After opening up each device, the setup process is incredibly simple. Everything is handled through Fast Pair. With a simple tap of the button on each tracker (dead center on Point, in the bottom left corner on Card), you’ll activate it and trigger Fast Pair setup on your nearby Android phone. Or, at least that’s how it’s supposed to work. My Pixel 8 Pro didn’t get the pop-up immediately on the One Point despite already having the Find My Device network available on the phone but, eventually , it did kick in. There is no way to manually add a tracker. Fast Pair is the only way to add a Chipolo tracker to your account. During setup, you’ll be asked to link the device to your Google account and reminded to use the device in a “responsible, safe, and legal way.” You have to agree to the “Acceptable Use Policy” to continue with setup, with the policy largely focusing on the inappropriate use of trackers to track and individual without their knowledge. Google explains three key points on a support page saying that you cannot use one of these trackers to: Track people or track property that does not belong to you. Identify a person’s presence or lack thereof in a physical location without their knowledge and consent. Otherwise attempt to obtain any information about another individual through the placement of a tracker tag without their knowledge and consent. Once you agree to the policy (clicking to read the full policy restarts the pairing process, frustratingly) you can finish setup and the tracker will then appear in the Find My Device app. The process is identical for both trackers. What if you don’t have the Find My Device available? In our testing, setting up one of these trackers can flip the switch and activate the network if it hasn’t shown up prior to that. Your results may vary. What can you do with Chipolo tracker in the Find My Device app? Once paired, what can you actually do with the tracker in Google’s Find My Device app? You can: See the tracker’s location Play a sound from the tracker Share the tracker with someone else Sharing, notably, is handled through a simple link share. When the device is not with you, you can also mark it as lost and get directions to its last known location. Those options only appear if the device is not with you, though. There’s a settings menu where you can rename the tracker (it defaults to the product name) and change the “category” of the object it’s attached to with options such as bag, wallet, and others. Notably, there’s also a way to be “guided” to the tracker’s location. While no UWB is used, the Find My Device app will point you in the general direction of the tracker as you approach it simply by telling you that you’re getting closer. What else do you want to know? We’ll be testing out these Find My Device network trackers from Chipolo as well as ones from Pebblebee in the weeks to come. But, in the meantime, what else do you want to know? Leave comments below and let us know any specific aspects of these trackers you’d like to see tested. The Find My Device network is rolling out to all Android users now, and early tracker orders are shipping starting today. You can pre-order Chipolo One Point and One Card now starting at $28, with new orders shipping in July.

        "description": "The mother of a schoolgirl whose body was found inside a barrel with gunshot wounds will testify for a second day in the murder trial of her former partner.",
        "content": "Kallista Mutten could face claims that she shot her own daughter Charlise as she continues giving evidence in the murder trial of her former partner. Justin Stein's trial continues in the NSW Supreme Court on Tuesday with Ms Mutten returning for a second day of testimony. Stein, 33, has pleaded not guilty to murdering nine-year-old Charlise, claiming he witnessed Ms Mutten shoot her own daughter. Charlise's body was found by police in a barrel by the Blue Mountains' Colo River on January 18, 2022 with gunshot wounds to her face and back. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Following a full day of evidence on Monday, Ms Mutten will now face cross-examination by Stein's lawyer, Carolyn Davenport SC. The court heard last week that following his arrest, Stein told a corrections officer he was traumatised after seeing Ms Mutten shoot the girl. \"I heard a shot and then I heard her screaming out for me. Then I ran back and she shot her again,\" Stein said, according to the officer. Ms Davenport told the jury during her opening address that it would become apparent Ms Mutten, not Stein, had motive to kill the girl. At the time of her death, Charlise had been visiting her mother and Stein over the Christmas holidays from Tweed Heads, where she lived full-time with her grandparents. During the visit, the group spent their time between a Mount Wilson property owned by Stein's mother, and a caravan at the Riviera Ski Park about a 90-minute drive away. The trial heard earlier from neighbours of the Mount Wilson property who said they heard conversations regarding Charlise's parental custody which hinted at plans not to send her back to Queensland. One neighbour had previously attended a dinner with his wife and mother-in-law where Stein, his mother, Charlise and her mother were also present. \"(Stein) said that if anything happened and the child didn't go back to Queensland that he would end up in prison again,\" the neighbour said. During her evidence on Monday, Ms Mutten told the trial she saw her daughter for the last time on January 11, when the nine-year-old travelled alone to spend the night with Stein at Mount Wilson while she remained at the caravan park. She said the following day Stein told her he left Charlise in the care of an auctioneer who was working at the Blue Mountains property where they were staying. Stein claimed Charlise had been vomiting and was too unwell to travel, and that she was in good hands because the woman was a mother of three and \"practically a nurse\", the court was told. Stein later said he believed the woman was not who she said she was and that Charlise may have taken by former associates from his criminal past. \"I said, 'we should go to police',\" Ms Mutten told the court through tears. \"He said, 'no, because if you ring the police they will kill her'.\" On January 13, while phone data tracked Stein allegedly travelling to three boat ramps across Sydney and eventually the exact location where Charlise's body was found, Ms Mutten believed he was \"going to war\" to find her daughter, the court heard. \"Justin said he's gonna go to war and go to places that he might think that she might be and go look for her and get her,\" Ms Mutten said. Later, she said, \"Justin had called me and said that he 'badly hurt' the man that was in the house (where) he thought Charlise was ... and stabbed him\". When he returned in the early hours of the next day, Ms Mutten says Stein told her, \"It's not them, you can call the police in the morning\". Ms Mutten called police to report her daughter missing shortly after 8am the next morning.",

        "description": "\"Walton was truly one of a kind,\" said NBA commissioner Adam SIlver. \"As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position.\"",
        "content": "Basketball Hall of Famer Bill Walton, who played two seasons for the Celtics during the 1980s, has died at age 71, the NBA announced Monday. Walton died “following a prolonged battle with cancer,” the NBA said. Walton played in the NBA from 1974 to 1987 for the Trail Blazers, Clippers, and Celtics. He was the NBA’s most valuable player in 1978 with the Trail Blazers and the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year in 1986 with the Celtics, and he was chosen as an NBA All-Star twice. Walton starred for legendary coach John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting. He was a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. NBA commissioner Adam Silver issued the following statement: Advertisement “Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. “Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered. “As a cherished member of the NBA family for 50 years, Bill will be deeply missed by all those who came to know and love him. My heartfelt condolences to Bill’s wife, Lori; his sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris; and his many friends and colleagues.” Advertisement Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games. Walton missed the 1978-79, 1980-81, 1981-82, and 1987-88 seasons because of foot injuries. He won NBA championships in 1986 with the Celtics and Trail Blazers in 1977. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game – UCLA against Memphis – in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ‘Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. Advertisement “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton was also known for his fanaticism for the music group The Grateful Dead. He frequently appeared on television broadcasts and other events wearing tie-dyed shirts with the band’s logos and markings. Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris, and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. “I am sad today hearing that my comrade & one of the sports worlds most beloved champions & characters has passed,” former NBA star Julius Erving write on social media. “Bill Walton enjoyed life in every way. To compete against him & to work with him was a blessing in my life. Sorry for your loss Walton family. We’ll miss him too. Doc.” The NBA’s Clippers, for whom Walton played when they were located in both San Diego and Los Angeles, shared a message on social media. “We have lost one of the greatest players and personalities that this franchise, this sport, and this region have ever known. Bill Walton is synonymous with Southern California basketball: a San Diego native, a UCLA phenom, a Clipper icon. Advertisement “He defined the game as a player, a broadcaster and an ambassador, spreading joy for generations. Wherever he went, whatever he did, Big Red stood above the crowd. The Clippers organization extends our deepest condolences to the Walton family, as well as our utmost gratitude. Bill was a singular force, and we were privileged to know him.” the Clippers wrote.

        "content": "Prey Veng Football Club, a Cambodian Premier League (CPL) member, officially announced on Monday that it has decided to dissolve the club and will no longer participate in football tournaments due to financial issues. There have been better days than this for Cambodian football fans and for football development in Cambodia with the unfortunate news that Prey Veng is withdrawing from CPL competition. The reason that the club is ending its run is an all too common story in Cambodia: the club does not possess enough financial resources to continue operations, leaving it with no choice except to dissolve. “The club has chosen to discontinue participation in football events since we recognise that our financial resources are far insufficient to meet our requirements. With this, we also ask to remove our membership from the Football Federation of Cambodia (FFC) and dissolve the club from now on,” the club said in an official statement. Prey Veng fans expressed their sadness at the news, and they are urging sponsors and others with substantial assets to help out the club to that it may re-enter the league. Satoshi Saito, previous CEO of the CPL, said during a meeting with journalists in September last year that the Cambodian football league is experiencing issues, and pointed out that the CPL is not as competitive as leagues in neighbouring countries like Thailand and Vietnam. This makes it more difficult to attract serious investment, he said. He suggested that several improvements must be made to the league to make it more interesting to football fans. One of them is to strengthen the league’s level of competition, its infrastructure, and promotion to a larger audience. By doing so, CPL teams can attract more spectators to the stadium, thereby encouraging sponsors to invest in football during a time when the league is receiving more attention than ever. Prey Veng is one of two clubs promoted from Cambodian League 2 (CL2) to the CPL for the 2023-2024 season. This season, Prey Veng finished eighth out of the ten league clubs. Puth Thyda, president of the Boeung Ket Football Club, another CPL member, revealed in an interview with reporters in March of this year, that her club is among those experiencing financial difficulties. She admitted that she considered dissolving the club due to the difficulty of finding sponsors to fund the team. “We love football and want to continue operating our club, but it is difficult to obtain sponsors to finance the team. There are few investors interested in financing Cambodian football clubs. It’s hard,” she said. Local media has reported that Prey Veng FC players will try to further their football careers with other local clubs.",

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than June 17, 2024 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) production of AST SpaceMobile’s five Block 1 BlueBird satellites had been negatively impacted by two suppliers of key subsystems; (2) as a result, AST SpaceMobile had not substantially completed the production of the Block 1 BlueBird satellites; (3) as a result, AST SpaceMobile’s five Block 1 BlueBird satellites were not on track to launch in the first quarter of 2024; and (4) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about AST SpaceMobile’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

        "description": "As Americans commemorate the sacrifices of wars past, Ukrainians are serving, donating, volunteering and dying now.",
        "content": "It looks like a video shot with a phone from an apartment window. The camera pans a line of cars stopped on the roadway below, and it takes a minute to understand what we’re looking at. Then a cortege comes into view : about 50 people walking slowly behind a coffin draped with the Ukrainian flag. When the shot widens, we see that traffic traveling in the other direction on the eight-lane road has come to a halt, and people have gotten out of their cars. A few are standing solemnly as the funeral passes; most are kneeling on the asphalt, heads bowed in respect. By the time I see the social media post, “The funeral of a fallen defender in Kyiv today,” nearly a thousand viewers have reacted with comments or emojis. Among the most common: Heroyam slava — glory to the heroes. Memorial Day in the U.S. was set aside to honor those who fell in the Civil War. Now Americans play “Taps” and put flowers on graves of those who died in many wars, all in the past. Here in Ukraine, people can only dream of the day when the flag-draped funerals have ended and battles are distant memories commemorated by a nation at peace. More than two years after the Russian invasion in February 2022, Ukrainians are tired. The war hasn’t been going well. Many of Ukraine’s friends abroad, particularly in the U.S., appear to be losing interest. According to a March 2024 survey, more than two-thirds of Ukrainians have a close friend or relative who is serving or has served at the front, and with the death toll reaching into the tens of thousands, all too many have lost someone. So perhaps it’s not surprising that the ardor and enthusiasm of 2022 have faded. The most conspicuous sign: In contrast to the first days of the war, when thousands rushed to recruitment centers and waited, often more than 12 hours, for a gun and a uniform, today the army is struggling to enlist fresh fighters , and the troops are suffering for it. It’s one of Russia’s main advantages on the battlefield. Still, even now, exhausted and disheartened as many are, Ukrainians have not lost their respect for sacrifice and honor. On the contrary, it seems to come up one way or another in almost every conversation. Some of my friends, civilians who have not served, argue that we’re all sacrificing just by remaining in the country. Nearly 6.4 million Ukrainians, some 16% of the population, remain abroad, after all, and those still here pay some price every day. “I could be in graduate school in Europe,” said one young man, a civil servant who doesn’t want to be named. “Instead, I’m sitting in the dark, with no running water and no way to heat food, waiting for the next air alert — a siren warning that a ballistic missile is heading my way.” Others dispute that civilian life requires heroism. “The only people sacrificing are those who are risking — and giving — their lives,” economic researcher Alvina Seliutina, 33, insists. “I can’t compare myself to them.” Still, there’s no mistaking her sense of duty. “It’s my country, it’s my family. You don’t abandon your family just because times are tough.” In fact, a recent poll suggests, 83% of Ukrainians are still donating regularly or volunteering, mostly to help the armed forces. Every business seems to have a fund; every social media channel solicits daily. Even students find ways to give. One tries to spare a few hryvnia every time he’s asked. “I don’t want to be the kind of person who ever ignores a fundraising request,” he tells me. Others give on a schedule. One volunteers at a clinic every third weekend; another shells out several thousand dollars every other month to pay for a drone for a friend at the front. Soldiers have mixed views, some more bitter than others, about the growing reluctance to enlist. Valery Shyrokov, 47, an infantryman and mortar gunner who volunteered in 2022 and served, among other places, in the bloody battle for Bakhmut, uses the word “disappointed,” but his manner suggests something far stronger. “I no longer speak to friends who haven’t served,” he tells me. “I can’t stand to be around them.” Yevhen Shramkov, 46, recently wounded in the fighting near Chasiv Yar, is more baffled than angry. “I’m not in the habit of judging other people,” he explains on a Zoom call from the hospital where he is recovering. “But I don’t understand those sitting it out. It’s like passing someone in the street who’s injured or endangered. Who doesn’t stop to help?” He expects to spend another month in the hospital and then head back to the front to join his unit. Both those who are serving and those who aren’t think that if the war were going better, more men would be enlisting. “If we had enough ammunition, if we felt the West were standing by us, things would be different,” one friend explained. “No one wants to be a meat shield for Europe. No one wants to die if we can’t win.” Maybe, maybe not. But the mood is nothing like in the U.S. in the Vietnam era or Europe at the end World War I. Elite units that promise skilled commanders and adequate training have no trouble recruiting. The legendary Azov Battalion is said to attract more applicants than it can accept. And it isn’t hard to sense the guilt, conscious or unconscious, that eats at most of my male friends who aren’t serving. “We know what the fight’s about,” my friend the civil servant reminded me. “Whatever sacrifice they’re making, however big or small, everybody understands why. Our lives are at stake and our existence as free Ukrainians.” Tamar Jacoby is the Kyiv-based director of the Progressive Policy Institute’s New Ukraine Project.",

        "description": "A new study has found that the common over-the-counter painkiller paracetamol does not cause in ADHD in children, a fear that has led many pregnant mums-to-be to worry needlessly, writes Dr Miriam Stoppard",
        "content": "When a woman is pregnant , she instinctively wants to protect her unborn baby from any harm and often refuses to take even the most ­commonly used over-the-counter drugs, such as paracetamol. Well, now pregnant mums can rest easy and take that painkiller. A study has given paracetamol a virtually clean bill of health . This new work is doubly important as it scotches the rumours that paracetamol causes autism and ADHD in the unborn babies of mothers who take it. Mums-to-be should now be freed of those anxieties, as should doctors. The study by Drexel University in ­Philadelphia, US, is the largest ever ­undertaken on paracetamol use, and was done in collaboration with the Karolinska Institute in ­Stockholm, Sweden. Together, they carried out the most robust risk analysis on giving birth to children with autism, ADHD or ­intellectual disability. Frankie Bridge fans obsessed with 'amazing' £45 linen River Island dress The strength of the study lies in the fact comparisons were made between siblings, where one baby had been exposed to paracetamol in the womb because the mum took it, and the other had not. The study encompassed data from 186,000 children whose mothers were prescribed paracetamol during pregnancy. “By comparing siblings, we can control for important family factors,” says Brian Lee, an associate professor at Drexel University and co-author of the study. During its follow-up, which spanned up to 26 years, the researchers saw a slight increase in the prevalence of autism, ADHD and intellectual disability in the entire population. So this study is important as it ­distinguished between trends in the general population and trends in the specific group of mums-to-be who take paracetamol. But when siblings exposed and unexposed to paracetamol in utero were compared, the researchers found no differences. This is very good news. “We did not see any increased risk of ADHD, autism or ­intellectual disability in the children that could be attributed to paracetamol use during pregnancy”, says Renee Gardner, associate professor of ­epidemiology and researcher at the Department of Global Public Health at Karolinska Institute, and co-author of the study. “We hope that our findings can ­reassure parents-to-be who are faced with the choice of whether or not to use paracetamol during pregnancy. “However, you should always listen to your doctor’s assessment of whether or not the medication is safe in each individual case,” she adds. I feel sure this is reassuring news for mums-to-be, midwives, health visitors and doctors. Dunelm's 'most comfortable' hanging egg chair is 'perfect for British weather'",

The aptly-named The Haven is one of just a handful of homes on a secluded headland, hidden out of sight and only accessible by foot. The five-bedroom property is on Hawks Point, on the edge of Carbis Bay in Cornwall and boasts an incredible uninterrupted sea view . It looks down on Porthkidney Sands, one of Cornwall's prettiest and most unspoilt beaches, just a five-minute walk away down a coastal path. The current owners knocked down the original old structure and built the existing property in 2011. An idyllic coastal home in Cornwall has gone on the market for £2.5million The five-bedroom property is on Hawks Point, on the edge of Carbis Bay in Cornwall It looks down on Porthkidney Sands, one of Cornwall's prettiest and most unspoilt beaches The property comes with breathtaking views, close access to nearby beaches and a sea-facing terrace complete with a hot tub The bedrooms look out onto the picturesque coast of Carbis Bay, Cornwall They used it as a family holiday home and also made a good income renting it out but have decided to sell. The property has 2,296 sq ft of accommodation with a reception hall, open plan kitchen/dining/sitting room, bedroom, bathroom and utility room on the ground floor and four more bedrooms, all with en suite bathrooms, on the first floor. There is a sea-facing terrace off the main living space and a hot tub to enjoy the views from. Off two of the bedrooms is a decked balcony which agents Lillicrap Chilcott says has some of the finest coastal views in Cornwall. The breathtaking views span the entirety of St Ives Ba, stretching to Hayle Estuary and along the coast to Godrevy and its famous lighthouse. Porthkidney Sands is a beautiful and unspoilt tidal beach, popular with surfers and dog walkers but remains fairly quiet even in the height of summer due to its relative inaccessibility - there are no near car parks and its sole access is from the coastal footpath. Carbis Bay is a popular area on the outskirts of St Ives and the beach there, renowned for water sports, was the site of the 2021 G7 Summit. Porthkidney Sands is a relatively quiet and unspoilt cove in Cornwall, remaining tranquil even in the height of summer thanks to low accessibility The spacious and airy home has an open plan kitchen, dining room and living space The 'magical property' sits almost within touching distance of the water and has an other-worldly feel Aptly named The Haven, the home is one of just a handful situated on the secluded headland Mark Bracey, from Lillicrap Chilcott, said: 'This house is in a magical setting with truly world class panoramic views. 'It sits out on a promontory above Porthkidney Sands beach and there are about half a dozen properties that can only be accessed on foot. 'That access might mean it is not likely to be someone's first home, but as a holiday home it is ideal. It feels like you are really in a different world. 'It is like no other house I have been to. You hear nothing but birdsong and the waves crashing below. 'Porthkidney is one of the most unspoilt beaches in Cornwall and one of the most beautiful, and it does not get too busy even in summer due to its remote position away from roads. 'The Carbis Bay branch line that takes you into St Ives is a short walk away. If you want the hustle and bustle it's just a short distance away but you can step out of that into this blissful enclave for peace and tranquillity. 'The view and the outlook are second to none. You have a private path that joins up to the coastal path and it's just a couple hundred steps and you're down on the beach within a few minutes.'

He was 71. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

        "content": "The clock is ticking for students camped at the Australian National University as a police deadline to vacate the area by noon approaches and those refusing to leave risk further action. Police told the protesters on Monday they could continue to protest but that it had to be at another location. \"Your current position is situated within the primary fire evacuation zone for the Kambri precinct,\" the police said on Monday. \"Non-compliance with this direction by 12pm tomorrow may result in further action by ACT Police.\" Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Those at the camp said they would hold on as they prepared to spend another night in tents amid chilly temperatures. \"We currently have no plans to shut down,\" one protester told AAP. \"There will be discussions based on how this plays out.\" The escalation at ANU follows news of other camps at the University of Melbourne and Curtin University in Western Australia packing up and going home. Campus security told the Canberra protesters to clear the area early on Monday following a directive from ANU. However, the students dug their heels in and put out a call for support from the community. More than 100 people showed up to support the camp as protesters linked arms around the tents to stop anyone from entering. As pressure mounted to make a decision on whether to stay or leave as the police presence grew, protesting students held a vote in which an overwhelming majority voted to stay. The ANU pro-Palestine encampment is demanding the university cut ties with weapons manufacturing companies, disclose and divest from all entities complicit in the \"genocide in Gaza\" and cut academic ties with Israel. The university maintains it has never told the students to stop protesting but they must move to another area to avoid safety risks to all students on the campus. The encampment currently sits in a main evacuation route for the campus and a failed evacuation on Wednesday highlighted \"intolerable risk to students, staff and wider public\". \"Everyone at ANU shares the same sense of responsibility for the safety and wellbeing of our community,\" the university said in a statement. Students at the encampment say the university has refused to meet with them to discuss a compromise before they were surprised with an eviction notice early Monday morning. On October 7, designated terrorist group Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1200 people and taking more than 200 hostages, according to Tel Aviv. Israel retaliated, launching a bombing campaign and counter-offensive in Gaza that, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, has killed nearly 36,000 Palestinians, injured more than 80,000 and displaced more than 1.7 million.",

        "content": "Rugby league player Taylan May is expected to face court accused of punching a woman in the face during an argument. The 22-year-old centre from NRL club Panthers is due to appear in Penrith Local Court on Tuesday to plead on charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and two counts of stalking or intimidating another person with the intention of causing them to fear physical or mental harm. May was arrested on May 18 after police allege he assaulted the woman on April 8 by punching her in the face during an altercation between the two. He was stood down indefinitely by the NRL on May 23, falling under the game's no-fault stand-down policy, which excludes him from playing until his court case is finalised. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. The league's decision comes after the player recently signed a two-year extension at Penrith Panthers worth close to $1.5 million. Despite their decision, the NRL has said it \"should in no way be interpreted as a view on the innocence or guilt\" of May. A statement issued by the club following May's arrest said they \"will continue to provide support to all parties involved and will not make any further comment at this time\". 1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732) Lifeline 13 11 14",

        "content": "Two senior Hamas commanders were killed and many were injured in Israel’s airstrikes that hit Rafah targeting a Hamas compound on Sunday night, reported Israel Media. The Israeli attack followed Hamas’s first rocket attack on Tel Aviv in months. As per Hamas health authorities, 35 people and two senior Hamas commanders were killed in Israel’s airstrikes injuring many more. Meanwhile, the Israel Defence Forces said the intelligence-based targeted strike had killed Yassin Rabia, the Hamas commander of the West Bank and Khaled Najjar, another senior member of the unit. In 2001 and 2002, Rabia committed several deadly attacks killing Israeli soldiers while Najjar was involved in commanding shooting attacks and other terror activities in the West Bank. He carried out several attacks during 2001 and 2003 killing Israeli citizens and soldiers. Najjar was also involved in funding Hamas terror activities, said the IDF.",

        "content": "There was a heavy presence of security personnel, including policemen, soldiers, and officials of the Department of State Services, among others, on Saturday at the Gidan Sarki Nasarawa, which is home to the dethroned Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado Bayero, Sunday PRIMANEWS can confirm. One of our correspondents, who monitored the development, also sighted some soldiers at the residence of the current Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi II; the Kano State Government House and some strategic places within the metropolis as part of efforts to beef up security following the tussle for power in the emirate. Following a new law repealing four emirates earlier created by a former governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, Governor Abba Yusuf of Kano installed Sanusi as the 16th Emir of the state. Sanusi had in 2020 been dethroned by Ganduje over allegations of corruption and other allegations. He was replaced by Bayero, who was enthroned as the 15th Emir of Kano. Ganduje also appointed Emirs for each of the five Emirates, but the controversial splitting of the ancient Kano Emirate into five domains resulted in widespread criticism across the state. Following his dethronement in 2020, Sanusi found himself at the centre of a contentious power struggle but his eventual reinstatement came alive on Friday, May 24, 2024, when the House of Assembly repealed the law signed by the former governor on December 5, 2019. The new law abrogated the establishment of the five new emirates in the state and reverted to the former status of a single Emir in Kano, thereby removing all the current Emirs except for the central Emir of Kano. Governor Yusuf, upon signing the law, gave all the Emirs affected by the law 48 hours to vacate their palaces and hand them over to the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs. The governor subsequently announced the reinstatement of Muhammadu Sanusi, whom Ganduje had deposed in 2020 as Emir of Kano. Yusuf said, “By the powers conferred on me by the Kano Emirate Council Law of 1984 and 2024, and supported by the recommendation of the kingmakers, I have the singular pleasure of confirming the reappointment of Muhammadu Sanusi II as the Emir of Kano and the head of the Kano Emirate Council.” Meanwhile, after receiving his reappointment letter on Friday, Sanusi led the Jumat prayers at the Government House, Kano, and returned to the palace early Saturday. A viral video sighted by one of our correspondents showed the moment he was driven back to the palace in a convoy. He was accompanied by the governor, his deputy, Aminu Abdussalam, and other government officials. However, his reinstatement heightened tension within the state as the deposed Emir, Aminu Ado Bayero, whose whereabouts were unknown after the governor deposed him on Thursday, also returned to Kano on Saturday. After his dethronment, a deployment of soldiers arrived at his mini-palace on Thursday. It was reported that other dethroned Emirs – Alhaji Nasir Ado Bayero (Bichi), Alhaji Kabiru Muhammad Inuwa (Rano), Alhaji Ibrahim Abubakar II (Karaye), and Alhaji Aliyu Ibrahim Abdulkadir (Gaya), complied with the directive. Meanwhile, Bayero’s aircraft landed at the Aminu Kano International Airport on Saturday at 4:30 am, where he was immediately greeted by supporters. He then urged residents to maintain law and order, pledged to obey the position of the law, and called on appropriate authority to deliver justice in the matter, saying justice would prevail. He said, “I call on the people to remain law-abiding while awaiting the outcome of the legal process in this tussle. We call on the authorities to do justice in this matter. Kano is a very influential state in Nigeria. Whatever affects Kano affects Nigeria. “May peace reign in Kano. We pray for Allah to bless Kano with responsible and just leaders. Justice is the way to go on every issue. There will be justice. Nobody is above the law. We will accept whatever the law says. I appreciate all the people who have shown concern. As I said, justice will take its course. We will keep on praying for peace in Kano State. May Allah the Almighty protect us.” ‘Arrest Bayero’ But, in a statement on Saturday by the Director-General, Media and Publicity, Government House, Kano, Sanusi Tofa, the governor ordered the immediate arrest of the deposed monarch for allegedly creating tension in the state. The statement partly read, “As the Chief Security Officer of the state, His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Kano State, Alhaji Abba Kabir Yusuf, has directed the Commissioner of Police to arrest the deposed Emir with immediate effect for disturbing public peace and attempting to destroy the relative peace the state enjoys.” Kano CP speaks Although no official statement has been given regarding the reason for the heavy presence of security operatives, an impeccable security source told one of our correspondents that the men were deployed by the Inspector General of Police, Kayode Egbetokun, to the three places to enhance security. According to the source, the deployment of security personnel to all the places was necessary to prevent aggrieved supporters of the two monarchs from attacking one another other. One of our correspondents monitoring the situation gathered that despite the ongoing debacle, the ancient city remained calm as residents continued to go about with their normal and lawful businesses. Meanwhile, the governor and other top officials were still with Emir Sanusi at the main palace while the deposed Emir remained in the Nasarawa palace. Closed-door meeting Earlier in the day, Governor Yusuf and Sanusi had a closed-door meeting with top security chiefs in the state. The top security chiefs who also had similar meetings with the deposed monarch included the Commissioner of Police, the Director of the DSS, the Army Brigade Commander, and the NSCDC commander at the mini palace in the Nasarawa area of the state. When contacted to give insight on the agenda of the meeting, the Command’s Public Relations Officer, SP Abdullahi Haruna, declined to speak. He, however, said the deployment of security agents was a normal security deployment. “The deployment of the security personnel is all over the state and it’s meant to enhance security given the current happenings,” Haruna said. ‘No breakdown on law, order’ Meanwhile, security agencies in the state had promised to prevent a breakdown of law and order as the safety and security of all the residents in the state remain sacrosanct. The Commissioner of Police, Usaini Gumel, in a joint security press conference at the command’s headquarters in Bompai Kano, on Saturday, said security agencies would enforce the court order restraining the state government from dissolving five newly created emirates in the state. Gumel said, “We are calling on members of the public to know that the police in the state are working together with the military and other security agencies and are at full capacity for providing adequate security to everyone as we are committed to carrying out our statutory duties as provided by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” Atiku sues for peace Meanwhile, former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, has said the action of the Federal Government in deploying soldiers in Kano in the tussle over the throne of the ancient city is an “upset to the peace and security of the state, and a breach of the constitution”. He said the Kano State House of Assembly passed the amended Kano State Emirate Council (Repeal) Bill (2024) in consonance with the provision of Section 4 of the Constitution 1999 (as Amended). “Governor Abba Kabir Yusuf’s signature on the bill repealed the 2019 version which balkanised the ancient Kano Emirate into five. The foregoing circumstances happened within the confines of the law and in compliance with the powers conferred on the Governor as provided by Section 5(2) of the 1999 Constitution as amended; and also in consultation with the Kingmakers of Kano, reappointed Sanusi Lamido Sanusi (also known as Muhammadu Sanusi II) as the 16th Emir of Kano State and accordingly handed him a letter of appointment,” he said. Speaking in a statement by his Media Adviser, Paul Ibe, on Saturday, Atiku said the former Emir could not have made his way into the Nasarawa Palace without the support of the Federal Government, alleging that he did so with the support of the army and other security agencies in his company. “We wish to state unequivocally that if for any reason, law and order breaks down in Kano State, particularly Kano Municipal, the Federal Government should be held responsible for the act of providing security cover to the former Emir, Aminu Ado Bayero, to come back to Kano is an invitation to anarchy,” he wrote. NNPP fingers Ganduje Meanwhile, the New Nigeria People’s Party, on Saturday, accused supporters of the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Dr Abdullahi Ganduje, who is a former governor of Kano State, of attempting to cause chaos in Kano to pave the way for a state of emergency. But Ganduje’s aide and the ruling APC described the immediate dissolution of the state’s four emirates and Thursday’s reinstatement of the 16th Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido, as a “vendetta mission”. The development comes in the wake of two demonstrations on Friday where protesters marched to the Aso Rock Villa and the National Assembly over Sanusi’s reinstatement. Speaking on the issue, the National Publicity Secretary of the NNPP, Ladipo Johnson, said the action of the NSA and the recent weird behaviour of the police showed that they were truly deploying federal might. He said, “It is not a surprise to us anymore as the police commissioner in Kano is beginning to say it is that court order he is following. That was why they used soldiers to take Ado Bayero to wherever they took him to. These people are the ones we believe want to cause a crisis in Kano.” Efforts to get the National Publicity of the APC, Felix Morka, to comment on the matter were unsuccessful. As of the time of filing this report, he had yet to respond to text messages sent to his line for clarification nor did he answer his phone calls when Sunday PRIMANEWS tried to reach him for a comment. Ganduje’s aide alleges coup But Ganduje’s Senior Special Assistant on Public Enlightenment, Chief Oliver Okpala, described the “palace coup” in Kano as a desperate move by the Kwankwasiyya movement and the governor to desecrate his principal’s legacies in the state. “Everybody knows that the government is a continuum. When Ganduje was in power, we all know he did his best and the people of Kano State can testify to that. He left some legacies that are yet to be matched by anybody. “What Ganduje has done in Kano cannot be destroyed overnight by political malice from any quarter. This is because what he left in Kano are monumental legacies,” he said. The APC National Director of Publicity, Bala Ibrahim, also shared Okpala’s sentiments. Ibrahim said he found it surprising that it was the same NNPP government that used to cry that is now ‘approbating and reprobating’ on the issue of Kano emirate. “When it suits them, they obey the court. When it doesn’t, they will disobey. They are forgetting the fact that they are products of a court order. No problem. This is the beauty of democracy though,” he said. When prodded to explain why Aminu Bayero is refusing to let go of the throne after Sanusi’s reinstatement, the APC publicity director believed his action was justified because he has not been officially dethroned. Ibrahim also knocked Governor Yusuf for rushing to issue the former Central Bank of Nigeria governor a reinstatement letter instead of borrowing a leaf from Ganduje’s diplomacy. The APC spokesman also faulted the Kano government over his claim that the judge issued the ex parte order from the United States. Ibrahim said argued that a court order can be secured from a serving judge even outside the courtroom. Don’t resort to self-help The Chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association, Kano State chapter, Sagir Gezawa, has begged all parties involved in the matter not to resort to self-help. Gezawa emphasised the constitutional duty of state assemblies to legislate and the governor’s prerogative to assent to such laws. According to the NBA, the implementation of law falls under the state’s apparatus and enforcement by a competent court of law once it is assented to by the governor. He also said that it is within the purview of courts to interpret such law to be in tandem with other existing laws or the Constitution. Gezawa urged NBA members to approach courts with competent jurisdiction responsibly. “Anyone found disobeying a court order must be proved to have been notified of its existence through the issuance of Form 48 and subsequently Form 49, as per the Sheriff and Civil Processes Act and various state laws,” Gezawa said. ‘Let peace reign’ The forum of Islamic clergy in Kano, Ulama, has urged President Bola Tinubu to intervene and prevent any actions that may lead to a disruption of law and order in the state. In a statement signed by 18 members of the Ulama, the clergies expressed their concerns regarding the ongoing dispute over the monarchy. The Ulama said, “Kano State is one of the most peaceful states in Nigeria despite its political complexity. The recent happenings in the Emirate if not carefully handled could escalate and degenerate into chaos. “President Bola Ahmed Tinubu must take all necessary steps to maintain peace in the State. Mr President as the leader of the nation should not allow the contest for a royal stool to degenerate into violence. We are calling on Mr President to allow the people of Kano State to resolve these issues amicably without the use of any force and loss of lives. They also maintained that the state government needed the cooperation and support of the Federal Government. Additional reports by Solomon Odeniyi and Daniel Ayantoye",

Acknowledging that his grief was not the same as that of families who lost loved ones during the course of their military service, Joe Biden told those in the audience that he understood \"how hard it can be to reopen that black hole in the middle of your chest\" whenever they remember them. \"As it is for so many of you, the pain of his loss is with me every day, still sharp, still clear,\" he said Monday. Beau Biden, a former Delaware state attorney general who reached the rank of major in the Judge Advocate General's Corps before he died from brain cancer in 2015 at the age of 46, was awarded a Bronze Star Medal for his yearlong service in Iraq . Joe Biden has repeated that his son's cancer was caused by his exposure to toxic burn pits while he was abroad. Biden also indirectly alluded to former President Donald Trump with a statement of the importance of democracy and respecting those who serve or have served. \"We gather at this sacred place for this solemn moment to remember, to honor, the sacrifice of the hundreds of thousands of women and men who have given their lives to this nation,\" he said. \"Each one bound by a common commitment, not to a place, not to a person, not to a president, but to an idea unlike any idea in human history: the idea of the United States.\" Earlier Monday, Biden hosted a Memorial Day breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leadership, veterans, and Gold Star family members before taking part in the wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier with Vice President Kamala Harris , Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin , and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Charles Q. Brown, Jr . \"Thanks to our fallen, the bedrock of our liberty remains unshaken,\" Brown said during the event at the nearby Memorial Amphitheater. \"It's up to us to further the cause for which our fallen died and uphold the freedoms for which they fought.\" \"In the end, America's greatest strategic asset will always be our people,\" Austin said. \"So let us always remember our fallen heroes and let us always strive to defend the democracy, [for] which they fought and die.

        "content": "Business in Cameroon | Fitch Ratings maintained Cameroon’s long-term foreign currency rating at “B” in its recent assessment published on May 17, 2024. This decision reflects a diversified regional economy and robust GDP growth. However, Fitch has downgraded the outlook from stable to negative. The agency said the state debt of Cameroon, including guarantees, arrears, and debts of the National Refining Company (Sonara), is expected to decrease to 39.2% of GDP by 2025, down from 43.2% of GDP at the end of 2023. This performance, significantly below the median expected “B” rating of 52.3%, is attributed to robust nominal GDP growth and low fiscal deficits. Despite these positive aspects, Fitch highlighted ongoing debt management issues. Cameroon temporarily accumulated a moderate amount of external arrears to the European Investment Bank (EIB) in August and September 2023, before settling all external arrears in a matter of days. This is a further non-compliance with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) target of no external arrears after 0.1% of GDP in 2022 and 0.2% of GDP in the first half of 2023, according to the agency. Persistent weaknesses in public finance management are also underscored by Fitch, with poor cash management and underestimated expenditures, notably fuel subsidies and unplanned security expenses, leading to off-budget expenditures and the accumulation of previous arrears. Although the stock of domestic arrears decreased to 0.6% in 2023 from 0.7% of GDP in 2022, it increased to 1.6% by the end of March 2024. Furthermore, Fitch noted that the government’s debt deficit narrowed to 0.6% in 2023 based on commitments, down from 1.1% of GDP in 2022, due to higher revenues, lower capital expenditure execution, and the deferral of fuel subsidies (0.4% of GDP) to 2024. On a cash basis, Fitch estimated that the deficit decreased to 0.4% of GDP in 2023 from 1.2% in 2022, with net arrears amounting to 0.2% of GDP. The agency forecasted that Cameroon’s financing needs will rise to 5.2% of GDP in 2024 and 4.6% in 2025, up from 4.3% in 2023, due to higher cash deficits. External debt amortization will average 1.9% of GDP in 2024 and 2025, including an annual Eurobond payment of 0.1% of GDP. IMF programs will provide access to financing and support reform efforts. Fitch also forecasts that the current account deficit will average 3.9% of GDP in 2024, compared to an estimated 4.0% in 2023. In political terms, the uncertainty surrounding the next presidential elections scheduled for 2025 contributes to the negative outlook. President Paul Biya, re-elected in 2018 for a seventh term, could run again, increasing political risk in an already tense political climate, according to the rating agency. Despite these challenges, Cameroon is showing resilient economic growth, with GDP growth forecasts of 3.9% in 2024 and 4.1% in 2025, driven by non-oil sectors such as agriculture, forestry, transport and energy infrastructure. By maintaining Cameroon’s “B” rating with a negative outlook, Fitch Ratings acknowledged both the country’s strengths and challenges. This decision comes amid varied positions taken by other rating agencies. In a recent analysis, Moody’s decided to maintain a harsh rating (Caa) for Cameroon, despite projections of debt stability until 2027. On the other hand, Standard & Poor’s recently upgraded Cameroon’s rating from CCC+ (high risk) to B- (highly speculative) with stable outlooks.",

        "content": "NEW YORK -- Two-time NBA champion and NBA Hall of Famer Bill Walton has passed away following a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA announced on Monday. Walton was surrounded by his family, according to the statement. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career - disrupted by chronic foot injuries - lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. \"One of my guards said, 'Let's try something else,\" Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden's response during that timeout: \"Why? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. \"It's very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA's program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. \"As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It's hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.\" The first overall pick of the 1974 NBA draft by the Portland Trail Blazers, the 6-foot-11 Walton played 10 seasons in the NBA, winning championships with the Blazers (1977) and the Boston Celtics (1986). He averaged a double-double over his career, totaling 6,215 points (13.3 per game), 4,923 rebounds (10.5 per game), 1,034 blocks (2.2 per game) and 1,590 assists. A two-time All-Star, he led the NBA in rebounding and blocks in 1977 and was the league's Sixth Man of the Year in 1986. After his NBA career, Walton turned to broadcasting where he entertained generations of basketball fans. Walton originally joined ESPN in 2002 as a lead analyst for NBA games before shifting to college basketball in 2012. He was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all-time by the American Sportscasters Association in 2009.. \"But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life,\" Silver said. \"He was a regular presence at league events - always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" --- Information from the NBA, ESPN and the Associated Press",

Insights into all the reactions that have since come to light, regarding Prince Harry’s absence from the upcoming wedding have been shared by a pal. This pal in question spoke to The Times and was quoted saying, “‘It’s incredibly sad it has come to this. Hugh is one of the very few close friends of William and Harry who has maintained strong bonds... with both.” In reference to this admission Ms Rebecca English also stepped forward with her own take to the matter. She dished over everything in one of her pieces for The Daily Mai land wrote, “It’s like a game of Twister, a tangled web of turbulent toffs that has sadly been pulled apart.” “I imagine William, though outwardly beaming, will actually feel a great deal of sadness that such a happy day cannot be shared. Catherine will not be by his side, as she continues her recovery from surgery.”",

Their appearance comes after the record producer was involved in a brawl with the rapper at Richie Akiva’s annual “The After” afterparty in Cannes, France. According to Page Six , the fight broke out last Friday around 5 a.m when Travis and Alexander’s friend Tyga were both in the DJ booth at the same time. Richie pulled out the mic and gave a shout out to Tyga and Alexander saying, “We got T-Raww and A.E in the house.” This didn’t sit well with Travis who returned to the stage, allegedly pushing Alexander which prompted him to drag Travis as well. Recently, the couple was seen putting on a united front while strolling around Monaco after arriving via helicopter from St Tropez. Cher and Alexander were also seen entering the celeb favorite hotspot Club 55. Their appearance also comes after the legendary singer said that she’s working on new music with her beau. Cher told a reporter at the 2024 Cannes Festival, “He and I are gonna start a new album. We haven't started yet; he's going to produce it.”",

        "content": "Social media is amassed with funny and viral videos showing how cats react to cucumbers after seeing them suddenly near them while eating. A number of clips show that the owner of cats subtly places a cucumber when their pet is eating. After suddenly seeing a cucumber near them, cats jump and go far away, making it funny for the onlookers. An expert in animal behaviour Jill Goldman told while speaking with the National Geographic Channel that the cucumbers were triggering the cats' natural startle reflexes, reported Independent . She said while explaining cats' terrifying reaction: \"With a startle response, a cat will often try to get out of there as quickly as possible and then reassess from a distance.\" Pam Johnson-Bennett, who is the author of Think Like a Cat was also quoted by the publication that placing cucumbers near where cats eat may confuse the cats further because they often associate those areas with safety and security. Goldman added that it was also possible cats may associate the cucumber with snakes, which can be deadly predators. \"If you cause stress to an animal that's probably not a good thing,\" Goldman stated.",

The Taoiseach made the comments as his party launched its local and European election manifesto in Dublin yesterday [mon]. As reported by the Irish Mirror last week, Fine Gael reported that the majority of the 16 migrant candidates it is running have received abuse.

Mr Harris called for leaders to “unite against the threat of political violence to our democracy”. “I'm deeply concerned by the increased targeting of local election candidates of all parties and none both online and in person by individuals intent on spreading division and hatred. “This is unacceptable and disturbing to individuals, to their families and to our democracy,” he said. “Let me be clear, the vast majority of people in this country are good, decent people whether they agree with you or disagree with you, they do so in a respectful democratic means. I fully respect that. “But I condemn those who shout and roar in people's faces in public, who follow them, who video who put the footage up widely after the incident by perpetrators to amplify the incidents. “The very horrific incidents as we've seen recently of people being attacked while trying to put up their election posters. “This tries to create fear, humiliation, anxiety for the targeted individuals, their families, their friends and their teams. “Shame on those who are involved in that. Let's make sure they never succeed in any way silencing democratic participation in this great country of ours. “Now is the time for all political leaders in all political parties and none to unite against the threat of political violence to our democracy. “Together, we must ensure that our democratic processes are safe, that they're inclusive, and that they reflect the values of all ordinary decent Irish people.” Ahead of the elections on June 7, Mr Harris told his party that if they had “done one housing estate and think it is time to go home for the cup of tea, do another”. “When you have knocked on 10 doors, find another,” he added.

        "content": "COOKSHIRE-EATON, Que. — Quebec provincial police are investigating after an entire herd of about 75 cattle were allegedly stolen in the Eastern Townships region last week. Farm co-owner Jonathan Fortin said he went to his field Friday morning to check his herd of Black Angus cows and calves, only to find they had vanished. Fortin says the alleged thieves left behind a broken fence and vehicle tracks, and that neighbours reported seeing trailer lights and hearing a commotion in his field the previous evening. He said the loss of about $200,000 worth of cattle represents a good portion of his life savings and four hard years of work building up his farm in Cookshire-Eaton, near Sherbrooke. Police spokesman Louis-Philippe Ruel confirmed that police opened a criminal investigation after arriving at the farm Friday and finding the cattle had “disappeared.” He didn’t say how police were planning to retrace the herd, but noted the thieves would need to have access to equipment and a place to put the animals.

        "content": "Cambodia’s national junior team won fourteen medals, including four silver and ten bronze, at the Badminton Asia SEA Regional Junior Championship 2024, which took place last Wednesday through Sunday in Laos. The Cambodia Badminton Federation sent four male and four female players along with two coaches to the tournament. Lieutenant General Cheam Sophea, the secretary general of the Cambodia Badminton Federation, told reporters that the Cambodia U17 team won two silver and four bronze medals, and the U15 team won one silver and five bronze medals. He added that in the Mix Team Event, which comprised both U15 and U17 teams, Cambodia earned one silver and one bronze medal. The SEA Regional Junior Championship 2024 saw five countries compete in the U15 and U17 categories: Laos, Timor-Leste, Myanmar, Brunei and Cambodia. Prime Minister Hun Manet expressed his admiration to the Cambodian national team following their triumph. However, the federation was disappointed, since it failed to achieve its goal to win two gold medals in the competition. Despite this, it believes the event was a great step forward for young Cambodian players eager to gain sporting experience. “Our athletes are inexperienced and young, and it was their first time competing on the international stage. So, we believe that it is an incredible chance for them to learn and improve themselves to become better in the future,” the secretary-general said. This was the Cambodian badminton team’s second appearance in the SEA Junior Championship tournament. The national team made their international debut in Cambodia last year, capturing one gold, six silver and seven bronze medals to finish second in the standings. The medal haul in Laos shows yet more progress for the development of badminton in Cambodia. The country made history at the SEA Games, winning its first gold medal ever in mixed-team badminton. The federation has said that it intends to promote the sport to a bigger national audience while at the same time fostering more young talent to join the national squad in preparation for major future competitions. The federation announced it will bid to host the Badminton Asia SEA Regional Junior Championship again next year. Through the tournament, the federation hopes to raise the profile of badminton – especially among prospective young athletes. With increasing numbers of people playing, badminton is becoming popular in the Kingdom, both as a hobby and professionally.",

        "content": "Reacting sharply to Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav’s accusations that the BJP is stealing the reservations of backward class, Dalits and tribals, Uttar Pradesh BJP President Bhupendra Singh Chaudhary said SP and INDI alliance leaders are always promoting religion-based reservations. Hitting out at SP and INDI alliance, Chaudhary said, “The leaders of Samajwadi Party and INDI alliance always talked about Muslim quota and they are promoting religion-based reservations wherever they form the government.” “When the election results come on June 4, you will not find Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi here. They will go to Bangkok or Thailand for vacation,” he further said. Speaking on the performance of the BJP in the ongoing Lok Sabha polls, Chaudhary said, “Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP is moving towards winning all the seats in Uttar Pradesh... BJP is winning all 80 seats. We will move ahead with the resolution of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make India a developed nation.” Meanwhile, Akhilesh Yadav accused the BJP of stealing the reservations of backward class, Dalits, and tribes, adding that after June 4, politics of “negativity” will be over. “They (BJP) stole the reservation of backward class, Dalits and tribes...The ‘P’ in PDA means Purvanchal, progressive; NDA is negative...They do negative politics....The time of doing negative politics is over...They are against social justice, reservation, caste census, the happiness of farmers....They not only want to take the nation backward but also put the people of the country in poverty,” Akhilesh Yadav told reporters. Uttar Pradesh is voting in all seven phases of the Lok Sabha polls, the last phase of which is scheduled on June 1. The Congress is fighting the polls in partnership with the Samajwadi Party in the state and have a seat-sharing agreement with each other. As per the seat agreement between the Samajwadi Party and Congress in Uttar Pradesh, Congress is contesting on 17 seats and the Samajwadi Party has the remaining 63 seats in the electorally crucial state. In the 2019 general elections, the BJP emerged triumphant, securing 62 out of 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh, supplemented by two seats clinched by its ally Apna Dal (S). Mayawati’s BSP managed to secure 10 seats, while Akhilesh Yadav’s SP garnered five. Conversely, the Congress party secured only one seat. The election for 543 Lok Sabha seats will be held in seven phases starting April 19. The counting of the votes will be held on June 4",

        "content": "A secretly recorded album by hip hop greats Wu-Tang Clan dubbed the world's rarest has been loaned to a Tasmanian museum. Only one copy of the 128-minute double-album 'Once Upon A Time In Shaolin' exists on two CDs, which were pressed in 2014 after six years of clandestine recordings. The 31-track work, which is enclosed in a hand-carved nickel-silver box, was stored in a vault in Morocco before being auctioned. It has changed hands several times before being bought by digital art collective Pleasr in 2021 for $US4 million ($A6 million). Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Tasmania's Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) on Tuesday announced the album would be on display from June 15-24 as part of its 'Namedropping' exhibit. The gallery will also host ticketed free listening parties in which a curated 30-minute mix of the album will be played from a personalised Wu-Tang Clan PlayStation 1. A legal agreement means the album cannot be commercially exploited until 2103, although it can be played at listening parties. \"Every once in a while, an object on this planet possesses mystical properties that transcend its material circumstances,\" MONA director of curatorial affairs Jarrod Rawlins said. \"(It) is more than just an album, so when I was thinking about status, and what a transcendent 'Namedrop' could be, I knew I had to get it into this exhibition.\" Wu-Tang Clan formed in New York in 1992 and are considered one of the greatest hip hop groups of all time. The album's master tracks were deleted and it cannot be streamed or downloaded. MONA says it has only been heard by a handful of people around the world and it is the first loan to a museum since the original sale. In a statement, Pleasr said it was honoured to partner with MONA to support Wu-Tang Clan's vision. \"Ten years ago, the Wu-Tang Clan had a bold vision to make a single-copy album as a work of fine art,\" Pleasr said. \"To 'put it in an art gallery ... make music become a living piece like a Mona Lisa or a sceptre from Egypt.'. \"With this single work of art, the Wu-Tang Clan's intention was to redefine the meaning of music ownership and value in a world of digital streaming and commodification of music.\" The group has said the album \"encapsulates the Clan's legendary dark funk and avant-garde sound and is produced in the original Wu-Tang style of the '90s\". Tickets for the listening parties will be up for grabs at 10am on Thursday. The exhibition also features original handwritten lyrics to David Bowie's 'Starman', showing edits and spelling corrections.",

        "content": "A filthy criminal threw faeces into the faces of two prison officers during a \"dirty protest\" in his jail cell. Michael Fitzimmons had smeared excrement across the walls and ceiling before blocking the sink and turning on the taps, flooding his cell with watery waste, which started to seep out onto the wing at HMP Northumberland , in March last year. When two prison officers, a man and a woman, spoke to Fitzimmons through an observation hatch in his cell door he threw bowls of the dirty water into their faces, with the male officer being hit in the eye. The court heard both were left \"stinking\" and in fear they may have been contaminated with disease that they could spread to their families. READ MORE: Road rage driver who bragged of 'street justice' convicted of manslaughter Keep up to date with all the latest breaking news and top stories from the North East with our free newsletter Fitzimmons, 30, of no fixed address, refused to co-operate with the court process. He entered no pleas, refused to give instructions to legal representatives or attend for trial. He was convicted of two charges of administering poison or noxious substance and one of criminal damage after a trial that was held in his absence. At his sentence hearing, which he also refused to attend, Judge Robert Adams sentenced him to two-and-a-half years behind bars. The court heard he was serving a 29-month sentence for false imprisonment when he staged the \"protest\" and would have been released from that in December last year. Judge Adams said: \"He was in his cell and decided to stage a dirty protest. He smeared faeces over walls and ceiling and blocked the sink. The sink overflowed and the water mixed with faeces.\" The judge said the water covered the cell floor before it started to spread to other cells and prison staff were alerted. When two officers arrived at Fitzimmons' cell door they spoke to him through the hatch and put towels down to try and stem the flow of water. Fitzimmons told them he was worried he would lose his \"canteen\" rights, where inmates can buy items they need but he was told that was not the case. The court heard they had never had any issues with him before but during the conversation he used a bowl to scoop out contaminated water from the blocked sink and threw it at their faces. One of the officers said in a statement: \"This has got to be the worst kind of assault. It's disgusting and I should not have to put up with it.\" The court heard a maintenance crew was called out to deal with the damage caused. The court heard Fitzsimmons refuses to leave his cell on the segregation unit and sits in it all with no TV. He has refused a mental health assessment and Judge Adams said \"there are undoubtedly mental health issues\".",

        "content": "England captain Jos Buttler is set to miss their third T20I clash against Pakistan on Tuesday in Cardiff due to paternity leave. According to ESPNcricinfo, Buttler returned to his home in London after England went ahead in the series following their 23-run win against Pakistan in the second T20I on Saturday. Buttler and his wife are expecting a child very soon. On Monday he missed England’s afternoon training session in Cardiff ahead of the third T20I on Tuesday. He will likely miss the third T20I however, it is yet to be seen if he will be available for the final clash of the series at The Oval on Thursday. Buttler had previously indicated that he would be present during the birth of his child which has raised concerns over his availability in the group stage matches of the T20 World Cup. England’s T20 World Cup defence will begin against Scotland on June 4 at the Kensington Oval in Barbados. They will then play group matches against Australia, Oman, and Namibia in Barbados and Antigua. England’s vice-captain, Moeen Ali last week gave his take on the significance of a possible leadership change. “Obviously if it happens, then it’s a great honour – as it always is. I’ll be fine. Nothing will change too much: it’s just taking over from what he’s doing and then when he comes back, he takes over,” Moeen said. “Hopefully, the baby comes at the right time where he doesn’t miss too many games. For me, it’s just whatever will happen, will happen. [Deputising] is not really difficult, to be honest with you, because we speak often, me and Jos. We talk about other things, the team, and all that. We’re on the same page anyway,” he added. Buttler was at his best during the second T20I against Pakistan with his 84-run blitz off 54 deliveries. His knock laid the foundation of England’s triumph in the second T20I. (ANI)",

        "description": "TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people.",
        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The mistake only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas, with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel’s military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night’s attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers “pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza’s population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from Israel’s strongest supporters. The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images” from the strike on Rafah “are heartbreaking.” It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. “There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he wrote. The Foreign Office of Germany, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel for decades, said “the images of charred bodies, including children, from the airstrike in Rafah are unbearable.” “The exact circumstances must be clarified, and the investigation announced by the Israeli army must now come quickly,′ the ministry added. “The civilian population must finally be better protected.” Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. The ICC only intervenes when it concludes that the state in question is unable or unwilling to properly prosecute such crimes. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine.",

        "content": "The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, on Monday, turned down the bail application filed by the detained President of the Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, Bello Bodejo. The Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore leader was arrested by the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) for unlawfully establishing an ethnic militia group, Kungiya Zaman Lafiya to promote terrorism, has been in the custody of the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) in Abuja. He was arraigned in March on a three-count charge filed by the office of the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), in which he was accused of violating the Terrorism (Prevention and Prohibition) Act, 2022. He denied all the charges. Bodejo had, through his counsel, Dr. Ahmed Raji (SAN) pleaded with Justice Inyang Ekwo to admit his client to bail on various grounds ranging from ill health to fundamental rights. He asked the court for, “an order admitting the defendant to bail on liberal terms pending the hearing and determination of the charges preferred against him.” The senior lawyer predicated the bail request on the ground that Bodejo “suffers from grave ill-health and that the offences are bailable. Citing Section 36 of the Nigerian constitution, Raji said his client is presumed innocent until proven guilty adding that the charge against Bodejo did not disclose any crime against him. Contrary to government assertions, Raji informed the court that launching of the group by his client was done in a public place with Police Commissioner and personnel of other security agencies as well as Nasarawa State government officials in attendance. Ruling on the bail application brought before the court by the Miyetti Allah’s leader, Justice Ekwo agreed with the submissions of counsel to the Federal Government, Y.A Imana that, the charges against the defendant borders on threat to national security. Imana had, while objecting to the bail application for the detained Miyetti Allah, urged the court to refuse him bail on the ground that the charges preferred against the defendant borders on threat to national security. Meanwhile, the court, after ruling on the bail application of the Defendant, fixed May 29 for his trial.

        "content": "IMD has announced that this year the southwest monsoon is likely to set in over Kerala on May 31. New Delhi: India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecasted above-average monsoon rains in the country this year in its Updated Long Range Forecast Outlook on Monday, confirming its April forecast of a good monsoon. “Quantitatively, the southwest monsoon seasonal rainfall over the country as a whole is likely to be 106 per cent of the Long Period Average (LPA) with a model error of 4 per cent. Thus above normal rainfall is most likely over the country as a whole during the monsoon season from June to September 2024,” IMD said. IMD has based the forecast of the good monsoon on the fact that the strong El Nino conditions which tend to disrupt the monsoon have weakened rapidly into weak El Nino conditions and are currently transitioning into ENSO-neutral conditions. The latest climate model forecasts indicate ENSO-neutral conditions are likely to establish during the beginning of the monsoon season and La Nina conditions, which result in good rains, are likely to develop during the later part of the monsoon season. IMD has announced that this year the southwest monsoon is likely to set in over Kerala on May 31. A good monsoon augurs well for the country’s agricultural sector which was hit by erratic weather last year. The monsoon plays a key role in the Indian economy as close to 50 per cent of the country's farmland does not have any other source of irrigation. The monsoon rains are also crucial for recharging the country’s reservoirs and aquifers from which the water can be used later in the year to irrigate crops. India has emerged as a key exporter of foodgrains but had to resort to curbing overseas shipments of sugar, rice, wheat and onions in order to increase domestic supplies and keep prices in check due to the erratic monsoon last year which hit farm production. The IMD defines average or normal rainfall as between 96 per cent and 104 per cent of a 50-year average of 87 cm (35 inches) for the June-Sept season.",

        "content": "The Lagos State Commissioner for Local Government, Chieftaincy Affairs and Rural Development, Bolaji Kayode Robert, has said that the state government directly interfaces with local government councils in its efforts to bring development to the grassroots. Robert, who made the disclosure on Monday in Alausa, Ikeja, while rolling out the achievements of his Ministry under Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s administration in the last one year, added that the ministry has continued to engage critical stakeholders in the state for grassroots development. This, according to Robert, “has yielded developments at the grassroots, and has culminated in the on-going rural-urban renewal projects, which have aided in reducing rural-urban migration.” “One of these efforts is the two-day capacity building workshop the ministry recently organised for 376 councillors across the councils, being part of the state government’s roles in improving the law-making capacity of councillors across the 57 councils”, he added. Robert said that the Lagos State government has reassured Lagos residents of its commitment to grassroots development in line with its Security and Governance pillar of the T.H.E.M.E.S. Development Plus Agenda. To this end, he noted that the state government assured that people at the grassroots would continue to be at the centre of its development policy, to ensure that the dividends of democracy are taken to the door-steps of the common man. He stated that Governor Sanwo-Olu intends to actualise the dream of Making Lagos a 21st Century Economy and delivering the reality of a greater Lagos. The commissioner noted that the state government has committed huge resources to paying insurance benefits to families of deceased local government and SUBEB staff, adding that Three Hundred and Ninety-One Million, Two Hundred and Twenty-Six Thousand, Six Hundred and Thirty-Six Naira and Five Kobo (N391,226,636.05) has been disbursed to One Hundred and Sixty-Four (164) beneficiaries of the deceased Staff in the last one year. Robert affirmed that his ministry remains undaunted, focused and unrelenting in its drive towards bringing the dividends of democracy to the doorsteps of the residents of the state and fully actualising the T.H.E.M.E.S. Plus Agenda of this administration. He also hinted that the ministry has continued to monitor and inspect projects and markets across the 57 councils to ensure proper hygiene, cleanliness, waste management and structural safety of facilities in the markets, which, he added, has led to safety and cleanliness in public markets. While noting that the involvement of traditional institutions in governance has continued to enhance peaceful co-existence among people of diverse backgrounds in the state, the commissioner stated that the approval and reconstitution of 84 members into the State Council of Obas and Chiefs by the Governor Sanwo-Olu administration has helped to promote a sense of belonging, equity and unity in the state. He further disclosed that the present administration has so far installed 50 traditional rulers without any rancor or dispute, attesting to people’s support and belief in the leadership quality of governor. In the same vein, Special Adviser to the Governor on Rural Development, Dr. Nurudeen Yekinni Agbaje, while responding to questions at the press briefing, disclosed that the ministry, through the Office of Rural Development, has in the last one year committed to strategic and critical infrastructural development in the rural communities, which includes ongoing road constructions in rural communities, consisting of a 400-metre road in Ijake Community, Oto-Awori LCDA; a 510-metre road at Ganiyu-Oduntan in Ikorodu with four other road constructions in Iganke Community, Agbowa LCDA; Ayubu-Bashorun Road in Ijede; Erelu-Amikanle Road in Alimosho and Onishon Street in Ibeju-Lekki. “Also, in our ongoing efforts in ensuring the provision of community-based projects, we have provided 500KVA transformers to communities such as Yologbo Estate 1, Igbe Alagbe Community in Ikorodu, and eight (8) other communities across the State, which includes Odan-Ilogbo-Eremi PH1 in Olorunda; LASU Campus, Ojo; Oral Estate CDA, Mojoda, Eredo in Epe; Owu CDA in Ibeju-Lekki; Gengenla CDA, Agunfoye in Ikorodu; Ama St, Ijede; Agbede Omolaye in Ikorodu and Liberty Estate CDA in Igbogbo-Baiyeku”, he noted. Dr Agbaje added that the projects and achievements chronicled by the ministry are noticeable in communities across the state because of Mr Governor’s unalloyed commitment to a greater Lagos project as envisioned in the T.H.E.M.E.S. Plus development agenda. While assuring that most of these projects would cut-across the state, Nurudeen also urged Lagos residents to take possession of the rural projects executed by the governor and guard them from vandalisation or destruction, considering that the projects are part of the efforts of the state government in improving the lives of people in Lagos. Present at the Annual Press Briefing is the Chairman, House Committee on Local Government, Chieftaincy Affairs and Rural Development; Sanni Okanlawon; The Commissioner for Information & Strategy; Gbenga Omotosho; the Permanent Secretary Ministry of Local Government, Chieftaincy Affairs and Rural Development; Kikelomo Bolarinwa, alongside her counterpart, Ministry of Information & Strategy; Olumide Shogunle and directors from the Ministry.",

        "content": "Scientists have predicted that by 2040, almost 50 percent of the world's electric power will be used in computing. What's more, this projection was made before the sudden explosion of generative AI. The amount of computing resources used to train the largest AI models has been doubling roughly every 6 months for more than the past decade. At this rate, by 2030 training a single artificial-intelligence model would take one hundred times as much computing resources as the combined annual resources of the current top ten supercomputers. Simply put, computing will require colossal amounts of power, soon exceeding what our planet can provide.One way to manage the unsustainable energy requirements of the computing sector is to fundamentally change the way we compute. Superconductors could let us do just that.Superconductors offer the possibility of drastically lowering energy consumption because they do not dissipate energy when passing current. True, superconductors work only at cryogenic temperatures, requiring some cooling overhead. But in exchange, they offer virtually zero-resistance interconnects, digital logic built on ultrashort pulses that require minimal energy, and the capacity for incredible computing density due to easy 3D chip stacking.Are the advantages enough to overcome the cost of cryogenic cooling? Our work suggests they most certainly are. As the scale of computing resources gets larger, the marginal cost of the cooling overhead gets smaller. Our research shows that starting at around 1016 floating-point operations per second (tens of petaflops) the superconducting computer handily becomes more power efficient than its classical cousin. This is exactly the scale of typical high-performance computers today, so the time for a superconducting supercomputer is now.At Imec, we have spent the past two years developing superconducting processing units that can be manufactured using standard CMOS tools. A processor based on this work would be one hundred times as energy efficient as themost efficient chips today, and it would lead to a computer that fits a data-center's worth of computing resources into a system the size of a shoebox.The Physics of Energy-Efficient ComputationSuperconductivity—that superpower that allows certain materials to transmit electricity without resistance at low enough temperatures—was discovered back in 1911, and the idea of using it for computing has been aroundsince the mid-1950s. But despite the promise of lower power usage and higher compute density, the technology couldn't compete with the astounding advance of CMOS scaling under Moore's Law. Research has continued through the decades, with a superconducting CPU demonstrated by a group at Yokohama National University as recently as 2020. However, as an aid to computing, superconductivity has stayed largely confined to the laboratory.To bring this technology out of the lab and toward a scalable design that stands a chance of being competitive in the real world, we had to change our approach here at Imec. Instead of inventing a system from the bottom up—that is, starting with what works in a physics lab and hoping it is useful—we designed it from the top down—starting with the necessary functionality, and working directly with CMOS engineers and a full-stack development team to ensure manufacturability. The team worked not only on a fabrication process, but also software architectures, logic gates, and standard-cell libraries of logic and memory elements to build a complete technology.The foundational ideas behind energy-efficient computation, however, have been developed as farback as 1991. In conventional processors, much of the power consumed and heat dissipated comes from moving information among logic units, or between logic and memory elements rather than from actual operations. Interconnects made of superconducting material, however, do not dissipate any energy. The wires have zero electrical resistance, and therefore, little energy is required to move bits within the processor. This property of having extremely low energy losses holds true even at very high communication frequencies, where losses would skyrocket ordinary interconnects.Further energy savings come from the way logic is done inside the superconducting computer. Instead of the transistor, the basic element in superconducting logic is the Josephson-junction.A Josephson junction is a sandwich—a thin slice of insulating material squeezed between two superconductors. Connect the two superconductors, and you have yourself a Josephson-junction loop.Under normal conditions, the insulating \"meat\" in the sandwich is so thin that it does not deter a supercurrent—the whole sandwich just acts as a superconductor. However, if you ramp up the current past a threshold known as a critical current, the superconducting \"bread slices\" around the insulator get briefly knocked out of their superconducting state. In this transition period, the junction emits a tiny voltage pulse, lasting just a picosecond and dissipating just 2 x 10-20 joules, a hundred-billionth of what it takes to write a single bit of information into conventional flash memory.A single flux quantum develops in a Josephson-junction loop via a three-step process. First, a current just above the critical value is passed through the junction. The junction then emits a single-flux-quantum voltage pulse. The voltage pulse passes through the inductor, creating a persistent current in the loop. A Josephson junction is indicated by an x on circuit diagrams. Chris PhilpotThe key is that, due to a phenomenon calledmagnetic flux quantization in the superconducting loop, this pulse is always exactly the same. It is known as a \"single flux quantum\" (SFQ) of magnetic flux, and it is fixed to have a value of 2.07 millivolt-picoseconds. Put an inductor inside the Josephson-junction loop, and the voltage pulse drives a current. Since the loop is superconducting, this current will continue going around the loop indefinitely, without using any further energy.Logical operations inside the superconducting computer are made by manipulating these tiny, quantized voltage pulses. A Josephson-junction loop with an SFQ's worth of persistent current acts as a logical 1, while a current-free loop is a logical 0.To store information, the Josephson-junction-based version of SRAM in CPU cache, also uses single flux quanta. To store one bit, two Josephson-junction loops need to be placed next to each other. An SFQ with a persistent current in the left-hand loop is a memory element storing a logical 0, whereas no current in the left but a current in the right loop is a logical 1.Designing a superconductor-based data center required full-stack innovation. Imec's board design contains three main elements: the input and output, leading data to the room temperature world, the conventional DRAM, stacked high and cooled to 77 kelvins, and the superconducting processing units, also stacked, and cooled to 4 K. Inside the superconducting processing unit, basic logic and memory elements are laid out to perform computations. A magnification of the chip shows the basic building blocks: For logic, a Josephson-junction loop without a persistent current indicates a logical 0, while a loop with one single flux quantum's worth of current represents a logical 1. For memory, two Josephson junction loops are connected together. An SFQ's worth of persistent current in the left loop is a memory 0, and a current in the right loop is a memory 1. Chris PhilpotProgress Through Full-Stack DevelopmentTo go from a lab curiosity to a chip prototype ready for fabrication, we had to innovate the full stack of hardware. This came in three main layers: engineering the basic materials used, circuit development, and architectural design. The three layers had to go together—a new set of materials requires new circuit designs, and new circuit designs require novel architectures to incorporate them. Codevelopment across all three stages, with a strict adherence to CMOS manufacturing capabilities, was the key to success.At the materials level, we had to step away from the previous lab-favorite superconducting material: niobium. While niobium is easy to model and behaves very well under predictable lab conditions, it is very difficult to scale down. Niobium is sensitive to both process temperature and its surrounding materials, so it is not compatible with standard CMOS processing. Therefore, we switched to the related compound niobium titanium nitride for our basic superconducting material. Niobium titanium nitride can withstand temperatures used in CMOS fabrication without losing its superconducting capabilities, and it reacts much less with its surrounding layers, making it a much more practical choice.The basic building block of superconducting logic and memory is the Josephson junction. At Imec, these junctions have been manufactured using a new set of materials, allowing the team to scale down the technology without losing functionality. Here, a tunneling electron microscope image shows a Josephson junction made with alpha-silicon insulator sandwiched between niobium titanium nitride superconductors, achieving a critical dimension of 210 nanometers. ImecAdditionally, we employed a new material for the meat layer of the Josephson-junction sandwich—amorphous, or alpha, silicon. Conventional Josephson-junction materials, most notably aluminum oxide, didn't scale down well. Aluminum was used because it \"wets\" the niobium, smoothing the surface, and the oxide was grown in a well-controlled manner. However, to get to the ultrahigh densities that we are targeting, we would have to make the oxide too thin to be practically manufacturable. Alpha silicon, in contrast, allowed us to use a much thicker barrier for the same critical current.We also had to devise a new way to power the Josephson junctions that would scale down to the size of a chip. Previously, lab-based superconducting computers used transformers to deliver current to their circuit elements. However, having a bulky transformer near each circuit element is unworkable. Instead, we designed a way to deliver power to all the elements on the chip at once by creating a resonant circuit, with specialized capacitors interspersed throughout the chip.At the circuit level, we had to redesign the entire logic and memory structure to take advantage of the new materials' capabilities. We designed anovel logic architecture that we call pulse-conserving logic. The key requirement for pulse-conserving logic is that the elements have as many inputs as outputs and that the total number of single flux quanta is conserved. The logic is performed by routing the SFQs through a combination of Josephson-junction loops and inductors to the appropriate outputs, resulting in logical ORs and ANDs. To complement the logic architecture, we also redesigned a compatible Josephson-junction-based SRAM.Lastly, we had to make architectural innovations to take full advantage of the novel materials and circuit designs. Among these was cooling conventional silicon DRAM down to 77 kelvins and designing a glass bridge between the 77-K section and the main superconducting section. The bridge houses thin wires that allow communication without thermal mixing. We also came up with a way of stacking chips on top of each other and are developing vertical superconducting interconnects to link between circuit boards.A Data Center the Size of a ShoeboxThe result is a superconductor-based chip design that's optimized for AI processing. A zoom in on one of its boards reveals many similarities with a typical 3D CMOS system-on-chip. The board is populated by computational chips: We call it a superconductor processing unit (SPU), with embedded superconducting SRAM, DRAM memory stacks, and switches, all interconnected on silicon interposer or on glass-bridge advanced packaging technologies.But there are also some striking differences. First, most of the chip is to be submerged in liquid helium for cooling to a mere 4 K. This includes the SPUs and SRAM, which depend on superconducting logic rather than CMOS, and are housed on an interposer board. Next, there is a glass bridge to a warmer area, a balmy 77 K that hosts the DRAM. The DRAM technology is not superconducting, but conventional silicon cooled down from room temperature, making it more efficient. From there, bespoke connectors lead data to and from the room-temperature world.Davide ComaiMoore's law relies on fitting progressively more computing resources into the same space. As scaling down transistors gets more and more difficult, the semiconductor industry is turning toward3D stacking of chips to keep up the density gains. In classical CMOS-based technology, it is very challenging to stack computational chips on top of each other because of the large amount of power, and therefore heat, that is dissipated within the chips. In superconducting technology, the little power that is dissipated is easily removed by the liquid helium. Logic chips can be directly stacked using advanced 3D integration technologies resulting in shorter and faster connections between the chips, and a smaller footprint.It is also straightforward to stack multiple boards of 3D superconducting chips on top of each other, leaving only a small space between them. We modeled a stack of 100 such boards, all operating within the same cooling environment and contained in a 20- by 20- by 12-centimeter volume, roughly the size of a shoebox. We calculated that this stack can perform 20 exaflops (inBF16 number format), 20 times the capacity of the largest supercomputer today. What's more, the system promises to consume only 500 kilowatts of total power. This translates to energy efficiency one hundred times as high as the most efficient supercomputer today.So far, we've scaled down Josephson junctions and interconnect dimensions over three succeeding generations. Going forward, Imec's road map includes tackling 3D superconducting chip-integration and cooling technologies. For the first generation, the road map envisions the stacking of about 100 boards to obtain the target performance of 20 exaflops. Gradually, more and more logic chips will be stacked, and the number of boards will be reduced. This will further increase performance while reducing complexity and cost.The Superconducting VisionWe don't envision that superconducting digital technology will replace conventional CMOS computing, but we do expect it to complement CMOS for specific applications and fuel innovations in new ones. For one, this technology would integrate seamlessly with quantum computers that are also built upon superconducting technology. Perhaps more significantly, we believe it will support the growth in AI and machine learning processing and help provide cloud-based training of big AI models in a much more sustainable way than is currently possible.In addition, with this technology we can engineer data centers with much smaller footprints. Drastically smaller data centers can be placed close to their target applications, rather than being in some far-off football-stadium-size facility.Such transformative server technology is a dream for scientists.

        "content": "Scientists have predicted that by 2040, almost 50 percent of the world's electric power will be used in computing. What's more, this projection was made before the sudden explosion of generative AI. The amount of computing resources used to train the largest AI models has been doubling roughly every 6 months for more than the past decade. At this rate, by 2030 training a single artificial-intelligence model would take one hundred times as much computing resources as the combined annual resources of the current top ten supercomputers. Simply put, computing will require colossal amounts of power, soon exceeding what our planet can provide.One way to manage the unsustainable energy requirements of the computing sector is to fundamentally change the way we compute. Superconductors could let us do just that.Superconductors offer the possibility of drastically lowering energy consumption because they do not dissipate energy when passing current. True, superconductors work only at cryogenic temperatures, requiring some cooling overhead. But in exchange, they offer virtually zero-resistance interconnects, digital logic built on ultrashort pulses that require minimal energy, and the capacity for incredible computing density due to easy 3D chip stacking.Are the advantages enough to overcome the cost of cryogenic cooling? Our work suggests they most certainly are. As the scale of computing resources gets larger, the marginal cost of the cooling overhead gets smaller. Our research shows that starting at around 1016 floating-point operations per second (tens of petaflops) the superconducting computer handily becomes more power efficient than its classical cousin. This is exactly the scale of typical high-performance computers today, so the time for a superconducting supercomputer is now.At Imec, we have spent the past two years developing superconducting processing units that can be manufactured using standard CMOS tools. A processor based on this work would be one hundred times as energy efficient as themost efficient chips today, and it would lead to a computer that fits a data-center's worth of computing resources into a system the size of a shoebox.The Physics of Energy-Efficient ComputationSuperconductivity—that superpower that allows certain materials to transmit electricity without resistance at low enough temperatures—was discovered back in 1911, and the idea of using it for computing has been aroundsince the mid-1950s. But despite the promise of lower power usage and higher compute density, the technology couldn't compete with the astounding advance of CMOS scaling under Moore's Law. Research has continued through the decades, with a superconducting CPU demonstrated by a group at Yokohama National University as recently as 2020. However, as an aid to computing, superconductivity has stayed largely confined to the laboratory.To bring this technology out of the lab and toward a scalable design that stands a chance of being competitive in the real world, we had to change our approach here at Imec. Instead of inventing a system from the bottom up—that is, starting with what works in a physics lab and hoping it is useful—we designed it from the top down—starting with the necessary functionality, and working directly with CMOS engineers and a full-stack development team to ensure manufacturability. The team worked not only on a fabrication process, but also software architectures, logic gates, and standard-cell libraries of logic and memory elements to build a complete technology.The foundational ideas behind energy-efficient computation, however, have been developed as farback as 1991. In conventional processors, much of the power consumed and heat dissipated comes from moving information among logic units, or between logic and memory elements rather than from actual operations. Interconnects made of superconducting material, however, do not dissipate any energy. The wires have zero electrical resistance, and therefore, little energy is required to move bits within the processor. This property of having extremely low energy losses holds true even at very high communication frequencies, where losses would skyrocket ordinary interconnects.Further energy savings come from the way logic is done inside the superconducting computer. Instead of the transistor, the basic element in superconducting logic is the Josephson-junction.A Josephson junction is a sandwich—a thin slice of insulating material squeezed between two superconductors. Connect the two superconductors, and you have yourself a Josephson-junction loop.Under normal conditions, the insulating \"meat\" in the sandwich is so thin that it does not deter a supercurrent—the whole sandwich just acts as a superconductor. However, if you ramp up the current past a threshold known as a critical current, the superconducting \"bread slices\" around the insulator get briefly knocked out of their superconducting state. In this transition period, the junction emits a tiny voltage pulse, lasting just a picosecond and dissipating just 2 x 10-20 joules, a hundred-billionth of what it takes to write a single bit of information into conventional flash memory.A single flux quantum develops in a Josephson-junction loop via a three-step process. First, a current just above the critical value is passed through the junction. The junction then emits a single-flux-quantum voltage pulse. The voltage pulse passes through the inductor, creating a persistent current in the loop. A Josephson junction is indicated by an x on circuit diagrams. Chris PhilpotThe key is that, due to a phenomenon calledmagnetic flux quantization in the superconducting loop, this pulse is always exactly the same. It is known as a \"single flux quantum\" (SFQ) of magnetic flux, and it is fixed to have a value of 2.07 millivolt-picoseconds. Put an inductor inside the Josephson-junction loop, and the voltage pulse drives a current. Since the loop is superconducting, this current will continue going around the loop indefinitely, without using any further energy.Logical operations inside the superconducting computer are made by manipulating these tiny, quantized voltage pulses. A Josephson-junction loop with an SFQ's worth of persistent current acts as a logical 1, while a current-free loop is a logical 0.To store information, the Josephson-junction-based version of SRAM in CPU cache, also uses single flux quanta. To store one bit, two Josephson-junction loops need to be placed next to each other. An SFQ with a persistent current in the left-hand loop is a memory element storing a logical 0, whereas no current in the left but a current in the right loop is a logical 1.Designing a superconductor-based data center required full-stack innovation. Imec's board design contains three main elements: the input and output, leading data to the room temperature world, the conventional DRAM, stacked high and cooled to 77 kelvins, and the superconducting processing units, also stacked, and cooled to 4 K. Inside the superconducting processing unit, basic logic and memory elements are laid out to perform computations. A magnification of the chip shows the basic building blocks: For logic, a Josephson-junction loop without a persistent current indicates a logical 0, while a loop with one single flux quantum's worth of current represents a logical 1. For memory, two Josephson junction loops are connected together. An SFQ's worth of persistent current in the left loop is a memory 0, and a current in the right loop is a memory 1. Chris PhilpotProgress Through Full-Stack DevelopmentTo go from a lab curiosity to a chip prototype ready for fabrication, we had to innovate the full stack of hardware. This came in three main layers: engineering the basic materials used, circuit development, and architectural design. The three layers had to go together—a new set of materials requires new circuit designs, and new circuit designs require novel architectures to incorporate them. Codevelopment across all three stages, with a strict adherence to CMOS manufacturing capabilities, was the key to success.At the materials level, we had to step away from the previous lab-favorite superconducting material: niobium. While niobium is easy to model and behaves very well under predictable lab conditions, it is very difficult to scale down. Niobium is sensitive to both process temperature and its surrounding materials, so it is not compatible with standard CMOS processing. Therefore, we switched to the related compound niobium titanium nitride for our basic superconducting material. Niobium titanium nitride can withstand temperatures used in CMOS fabrication without losing its superconducting capabilities, and it reacts much less with its surrounding layers, making it a much more practical choice.The basic building block of superconducting logic and memory is the Josephson junction. At Imec, these junctions have been manufactured using a new set of materials, allowing the team to scale down the technology without losing functionality. Here, a tunneling electron microscope image shows a Josephson junction made with alpha-silicon insulator sandwiched between niobium titanium nitride superconductors, achieving a critical dimension of 210 nanometers. ImecAdditionally, we employed a new material for the meat layer of the Josephson-junction sandwich—amorphous, or alpha, silicon. Conventional Josephson-junction materials, most notably aluminum oxide, didn't scale down well. Aluminum was used because it \"wets\" the niobium, smoothing the surface, and the oxide was grown in a well-controlled manner. However, to get to the ultrahigh densities that we are targeting, we would have to make the oxide too thin to be practically manufacturable. Alpha silicon, in contrast, allowed us to use a much thicker barrier for the same critical current.We also had to devise a new way to power the Josephson junctions that would scale down to the size of a chip. Previously, lab-based superconducting computers used transformers to deliver current to their circuit elements. However, having a bulky transformer near each circuit element is unworkable. Instead, we designed a way to deliver power to all the elements on the chip at once by creating a resonant circuit, with specialized capacitors interspersed throughout the chip.At the circuit level, we had to redesign the entire logic and memory structure to take advantage of the new materials' capabilities. We designed anovel logic architecture that we call pulse-conserving logic. The key requirement for pulse-conserving logic is that the elements have as many inputs as outputs and that the total number of single flux quanta is conserved. The logic is performed by routing the SFQs through a combination of Josephson-junction loops and inductors to the appropriate outputs, resulting in logical ORs and ANDs. To complement the logic architecture, we also redesigned a compatible Josephson-junction-based SRAM.Lastly, we had to make architectural innovations to take full advantage of the novel materials and circuit designs. Among these was cooling conventional silicon DRAM down to 77 kelvins and designing a glass bridge between the 77-K section and the main superconducting section. The bridge houses thin wires that allow communication without thermal mixing. We also came up with a way of stacking chips on top of each other and are developing vertical superconducting interconnects to link between circuit boards.A Data Center the Size of a ShoeboxThe result is a superconductor-based chip design that's optimized for AI processing. A zoom in on one of its boards reveals many similarities with a typical 3D CMOS system-on-chip. The board is populated by computational chips: We call it a superconductor processing unit (SPU), with embedded superconducting SRAM, DRAM memory stacks, and switches, all interconnected on silicon interposer or on glass-bridge advanced packaging technologies.But there are also some striking differences. First, most of the chip is to be submerged in liquid helium for cooling to a mere 4 K. This includes the SPUs and SRAM, which depend on superconducting logic rather than CMOS, and are housed on an interposer board. Next, there is a glass bridge to a warmer area, a balmy 77 K that hosts the DRAM. The DRAM technology is not superconducting, but conventional silicon cooled down from room temperature, making it more efficient. From there, bespoke connectors lead data to and from the room-temperature world.Davide ComaiMoore's law relies on fitting progressively more computing resources into the same space. As scaling down transistors gets more and more difficult, the semiconductor industry is turning toward3D stacking of chips to keep up the density gains. In classical CMOS-based technology, it is very challenging to stack computational chips on top of each other because of the large amount of power, and therefore heat, that is dissipated within the chips. In superconducting technology, the little power that is dissipated is easily removed by the liquid helium. Logic chips can be directly stacked using advanced 3D integration technologies resulting in shorter and faster connections between the chips, and a smaller footprint.It is also straightforward to stack multiple boards of 3D superconducting chips on top of each other, leaving only a small space between them. We modeled a stack of 100 such boards, all operating within the same cooling environment and contained in a 20- by 20- by 12-centimeter volume, roughly the size of a shoebox. We calculated that this stack can perform 20 exaflops (inBF16 number format), 20 times the capacity of the largest supercomputer today. What's more, the system promises to consume only 500 kilowatts of total power. This translates to energy efficiency one hundred times as high as the most efficient supercomputer today.So far, we've scaled down Josephson junctions and interconnect dimensions over three succeeding generations. Going forward, Imec's road map includes tackling 3D superconducting chip-integration and cooling technologies. For the first generation, the road map envisions the stacking of about 100 boards to obtain the target performance of 20 exaflops. Gradually, more and more logic chips will be stacked, and the number of boards will be reduced. This will further increase performance while reducing complexity and cost.The Superconducting VisionWe don't envision that superconducting digital technology will replace conventional CMOS computing, but we do expect it to complement CMOS for specific applications and fuel innovations in new ones. For one, this technology would integrate seamlessly with quantum computers that are also built upon superconducting technology. Perhaps more significantly, we believe it will support the growth in AI and machine learning processing and help provide cloud-based training of big AI models in a much more sustainable way than is currently possible.In addition, with this technology we can engineer data centers with much smaller footprints. Drastically smaller data centers can be placed close to their target applications, rather than being in some far-off football-stadium-size facility.Such transformative server technology is a dream for scientists. It opens doors to online training of AI models on real data that are part of an actively changing environment. Take potential robotic farms as an example. Today, training these would be a challenging task, where the required processing capabilities are available only in far-away, power-hungry data centers. With compact, nearby data centers, the data could be processed at once, allowing an AI to learn from current conditions on the farmSimilarly, these miniature data centers can be interspersed in energy grids, learning right away at each node and distributing electricity more efficiently throughout the world. Imagine smart cities, mobile health care systems, manufacturing, farming, and more, all benefiting from instant feedback from adjacent AI learners, optimizing and improving decision making in real time.",

        "content": "One of the UK's best beaches, known for its orange cliffs and serene sand, could soon disappear and be washed away into the sea. Known for its peacefulness and remote location, Covehithe beach in Suffolk has been named as one of the best beaches in the UK by the The Sunday Times. However, the under-the-radar beach may not be around for much longer as it suffers from the highest rate of erosion in the country of any beach. Between the 1830s and 2001, the cliff-face has lost over 500 metres and according to the area's Shoreline Management Plan, Clovehithe's cliffs erode around 4.5 metres a year. The Environment Agency has warned that the main part of the settlement at Covehithe - which is roughly 250 metres from the shoreline - is expected to be claimed by the sea by 2110. However, it could tumble beneath the waves as early as 2040. As a consequence, the cliffs in the area pose a constant risk to members of the public who visit the beach.

The Northern Irishman has been linked with both the Red Devils and Blues, although the Stamford Bridge hierarchy now look set to appoint Leicester boss Enzo Maresca. United had sounded him out as a potential replacement for Erik ten Hag, while Brighton were also interested in him as Roberto De Zerbi's successor. Now, McKenna has made the bold decision to stay with Ipswich. According to various reports, he will sign a new long-term contract in Suffolk. It was reported the Tractor Boys were willing to offer McKenna the biggest contract in the club's history. It would see him earn around £5m per year - around four times what he currently banks. Ipswich had also made an effort to keep McKenna last year by slotting...",

The Loose Women star shares 22-year-old son Jack with Eamonn. He is the only child of the former couple, while Eamonn has three older kids from previous marriage to first wife Gabrielle Holmes.

A joint statement released by their reps said: \"Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes have confirmed their marriage is over and they are in the process of divorcing.\" Eamonn is now thought to have moved out of the £3.2 million home him and Ruth own in Weybridge, Surrey.

Chloe Quick, 23, was inspired when her best friend Leah Mattson, 26, underwent a gastric sleeve and signed up for the procedure herself. But Chloe found herself in ICU with just a 50% chance of survival and Leah frantically began fundraising to fly her friend back to the UK. Chloe is now recovering at home in Hereford with Leah's help. The two women, who work together, live on the same street, and who went through pregnancy together, are now thankful to be losing weight together too. They are speaking out to highlight both sides of weight loss surgery. Leah says: \"I really encouraged Chloe to have the surgery because it had been a success for me. She saw it as a new start, a second chance. \"My own surgery saved my life, but it nearly killed my best friend. I am just so relieved she is back home, and we can begin looking to the future now. She's been through hell, but it has really cemented our friendship, and made us both grateful to be alive.\" Leah and Chloe met in 2020 through mutual friends. Early in 2021, both fell pregnant, and their babies were born just four weeks apart.

It was lovely to go through it all together.\" Chloe's son, Oliver, was born first in October 2021, followed by Leah's daughter, Esmae, four weeks later. Health care assistant Chloe says: \"After our children were born, we became very close. Leah is godmother to my son. We went to baby classes together and we helped each other out daily. Leah then moved onto my street, and I got a job at the same hospital as her.

        "content": "More than 2,000 are believed to have been buried alive in Papua New Guinea's tragic landslide, officials say, despite the figure being disputed. The South Pacific island's government has asked for help from the UN after Friday's landslide, which was initially estimated to have killed 670. Despite this, only five people have been recovered in the disaster's aftermath. A letter sent to the UN by acting director of the country's National Disaster Center, Luseta Laso Mana, on Sunday said the landslide \"buried more than 2,000 people alive\", causing \"major destruction\" in the village of Yambali in the Enga province. Figures on the number of casualties have fluctuated since Friday, however. The toll of 670 was based on calculations by the village and provincial officials, who said 150 homes had been flattened by the landslide - up from the previous estimate of 60. Despite new evidence, the UN's International Organisation for Migration hasn't changed its estimated death toll. Image: Satellite image 2024 Maxar Technologies)... (Image: No credit)",

The striker has spent the season with the La Liga side after being suspended by United following charges of attempted rape, controlling and coercive behaviour and assault. The Crown Prosecution Service eventually discontinued their case against Greenwood. Greenwood joined Getafe last summer, scoring 10 times in 46 games, though has bid farewell to the Spanish team. He said: \"Thank you for making me feel welcome and one of your own. I enjoyed every second, alongside my team-mates and club. A bitter-sweet ending, but it was a pleasure to play for you, I wish you all the best.\" It is currently unclear what Greenwood's plans are for next season, though a move appears almost certain. Here, Mirror Football looks at five of Greenwood's potential options over the summer window. Getafe A return to Getafe would benefit all parties, with Greenwood having enjoyed his season on loan there.

Fort William in the Scottish Highlands received the title of 'worst spot' for a mini-break in Scotland and across the UK, according to new research. Scotland is known for making its way to the top of international rankings as one of the most beautiful destinations in the world. But Fort William, in the West Highlands, hasn't been so lucky with its recent reputation. The town has come up in the bottom ranks as being one of the poorest destinations for a holiday across the entire UK, according to Which?, which surveyed 3,967 people rating towns and cities around the UK they had stayed in for leisure. Fort William came last, tying with Torquay in England on the list of low-ranking 'small UK cities', scoring a mere 58%. Which? found there were several shortcomings in the town that may have contributed to its poor ranking. The judgement was rather harsh, with Fort William scoring just two stars out of five across four categories: food and drink, accommodation, shopping, and 'ease of getting around'.

A lifebuoy was thrown, but a subsequent search by police and the coastguard found nothing.

        "content": "India’s bowling duo Yuzvendra Chahal and Avesh Khan left to link up with the first batch of the Men in Blue squad in New York ahead of the ICC T20 World Cup starting from June 1 onwards. The World Cup-bound star spinner Chahal, who featured for Rajasthan Royals (RR) in the recently concluded IPL 2024, enjoyed an impressive campaign in which he bagged 18 wickets. Meanwhile, pacer Avesh Khan will be with India as a reserve player. At the Mumbai airport, pacer Avesh was seen talking to another reserve player Rinku Singh on video call. Earlier on Sunday, the first batch of Indian players including skipper Rohit Sharma, pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah and number-one-ranked T20I batter Suryakumar Yadav left for the United States. At the Mumbai airport, besides skipper Rohit, Bumrah and Suryakumar, head coach Rahul Dravid, batting coach Vikram Rathour, batter Shubman Gill, all-rounders Ravindra Jadeja and Shivam Dube, pacers Mohammed Siraj, Arshdeep Singh, Khaleel Ahmed, spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel were also captured at the airport. Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson who on Friday ended their Indian Premier League (IPL) campaign with Rajasthan Royals (RR) after a loss to Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) batter Rinku Singh and star batter Virat Kohli, whose team Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) lost to RR in the eliminator on Friday, have not joined the team yet. India will start their T20 World Cup campaign on June 5 against Ireland at the newly constructed Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York. Meanwhile, the most-awaited blockbuster clash between India and Pakistan will take place on June 9. They will later play tournament co-hosts USA (June 12) and Canada (June 15) to wrap up their Group A matches. In the tournament, India will be aiming to end their ICC trophy drought, having last won the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013. Since then, India has reached the 50-over World Cup final in 2023, semifinal in 2015 and 2019, the title clash of the ICC World Test Championship in 2021 and 2023, T20 WC final in 2014, semifinals in 2016 and 2022 but failed to secure a big ICC trophy. India will be aiming to win their first T20 WC title ever since they won the inaugural edition of the tournament back in 2007 in South Africa. In the last edition held in Australia in 2022, India lost to England by 10 wickets in the semifinals. India squad: Rohit Sharma (c), Hardik Pandya (vc), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant (wk), Sanju Samson (wk), Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohd.

        "description": "Hip hop legends Wu-Tang Clan secretly recorded an album and then deleted the masters to leave only one copy. Find out where in Australia you can listen to it.",
        "content": "A secretly recorded album by hip hop greats Wu-Tang Clan dubbed the world's rarest has been loaned to a Tasmanian museum. Only one copy of the 128-minute double-album 'Once Upon A Time In Shaolin' exists on two CDs, which were pressed in 2014 after six years of clandestine recordings. The 31-track work, which is enclosed in a hand-carved nickel-silver box, was stored in a vault in Morocco before being auctioned. It has changed hands several times before being bought by digital art collective Pleasr in 2021 for $US4 million ($A6 million). Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Tasmania's Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) on Tuesday announced the album would be on display from June 15-24 as part of its 'Namedropping' exhibit. The gallery will also host ticketed free listening parties in which a curated 30-minute mix of the album will be played from a personalised Wu-Tang Clan PlayStation 1. A legal agreement means the album cannot be commercially exploited until 2103, although it can be played at listening parties. \"Every once in a while, an object on this planet possesses mystical properties that transcend its material circumstances,\" MONA director of curatorial affairs Jarrod Rawlins said. \"(It) is more than just an album, so when I was thinking about status, and what a transcendent 'Namedrop' could be, I knew I had to get it into this exhibition.\" Wu-Tang Clan formed in New York in 1992 and are considered one of the greatest hip hop groups of all time. The album's master tracks were deleted and it cannot be streamed or downloaded. MONA says it has only been heard by a handful of people around the world and it is the first loan to a museum since the original sale. In a statement, Pleasr said it was honoured to partner with MONA to support Wu-Tang Clan's vision. \"Ten years ago, the Wu-Tang Clan had a bold vision to make a single-copy album as a work of fine art,\" Pleasr said. \"To 'put it in an art gallery ... make music become a living piece like a Mona Lisa or a sceptre from Egypt.'. \"With this single work of art, the Wu-Tang Clan's intention was to redefine the meaning of music ownership and value in a world of digital streaming and commodification of music.\" The group has said the album \"encapsulates the Clan's legendary dark funk and avant-garde sound and is produced in the original Wu-Tang style of the '90s\". Tickets for the listening parties will be up for grabs at 10am on Thursday. The exhibition also features original handwritten lyrics to David Bowie's 'Starman', showing edits and spelling corrections.",

Assembly co-chairs Rueben Berg will front the Yoorrook Justice Commission alongside his counterpart Ngarra Murray on Tuesday. Mr Berg said the treaty talks with the state government are set to begin later this year and will focus on the transfer decision-making powers to Indigenous people. \"Obviously Aboriginal people are the experts when it comes to Aboriginal matters,\" he said. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. \"When it comes to Aboriginal communities and cultures and things like looking after our sacred sites and burial grounds and so on, of course we think it should be us making the decisions.\" Mr Berg went on to detail how First Nations communities could be impacted by receiving profits from projects on their traditional land \"We need to reset the system, so Aboriginal communities have the economic opportunities we've been denied,\" he said. \"That way we can create prosperity that we can hand down the generations, just like everyone else has been able to do.\" Ms Murray took aim at Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan confessing to the commission last month that she did not know the history of massacres close to her home city of Bendigo before preparing for her appearance. \"A lot of people don't know the true history of this place and the extent of what was done to our people,\" Ms Murray said. \"So it's hard for them to understand the problems that grew out of that history which we still face today and need to fix.\" Treaty aims to provide a path to negotiate the transfer of power and resources for First Peoples to control matters impacting their lives, the assembly said. Yoorrook is creating an official public record on the impact of colonisation on Aboriginal people in Victoria and will recommend actions to address historical and ongoing injustices.",

        "content": "For every dollar invested in clean energy companies, superannuation funds have five dollars invested in the expansion of fossil fuels, an index has found. Australia's top 30 super funds have more than $39 billion invested in the global expansion of gas, coal and oil, according to a report released on Tuesday by shareholder organisation Market Forces. Retirement savings allocated across the Climate Wreckers Index - a group of 190 coal, oil and gas companies - have more than doubled in the two years to December 2023 in the largest or default investment options, based on the latest available disclosures. Simultaneously, the amount allocated to listed clean energy companies has declined by half a billion dollars to a mere $7.7 billion despite the funds' climate pledges. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Even as the market watchdog warns it is on the lookout for false green credentials, almost all of these super funds have signed up for net zero emissions by 2050 or acknowledge that climate change poses significant risks. Yet the index showed no major trend of these super funds actively selling down stakes in \"climate wrecker\" companies. Those most exposed to the expansion of fossil fuels were savers in UniSuper - Balanced, Commonwealth Super Corp - PSS Default, and MLC - MySuper Growth, according to the index. Market Forces called for the super funds to do better if they are to avoid scrutiny from regulators or face legal action for greenwashing. For the first time, researchers identified each fund's share of emissions from the fossil fuel expansion plans of index members and fingered three companies as the biggest polluters. Woodside Energy, gas giant Santos and Whitehaven Coal were found to be responsible for more than half (59 per cent) of index companies' projected emissions attributable to expansion plans. Woodside and Santos can no longer obtain project finance for new oil and gas field developments from Australia's big four banks, according to Market Forces. Now Australian super funds are being urged to clean up their members' retirement accounts. \"Thousands of members are furious that large funds including AustralianSuper, Australian Retirement Trust and HESTA are failing to rein in the climate-wrecking business plans of companies like Woodside,\" Market Forces spokesman Brett Morgan said. The combined emissions from these expansion projects, totalling more than 129 gigatonnes, would eat up about half of the remaining global carbon budget for keeping global warming to 1.5C, according to the research. Resources heavyweight BHP was called out as a \"significant problem\", with the five biggest funds collectively owning nearly eight per cent of it across their dozens of investment options. However, Vision Super's chief investment officer Michael Wyrsch said there could be favourable outcomes for climate risk if BHP was successful in its attempted takeover of South African mining behemoth Anglo American. BHP may close down some coal mines earlier than would be the case if Anglo American remained a stand-alone company, which would be good thing, he said.",

        "content": "The Independent National Electoral Commission on Monday, commenced the Continuous Voter Registration exercise in Edo State. The exercise is meant to capture would-be voters yet register ahead of the governorship election in Edo on September 21. He added that both the CVR and the PVC collection would be a 10-day exercise from May 27 to June 5, 2024, from 9 am to 3 pm daily including weekends. This is despite a call from the state acting chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Jarret Tenebe on Friday, to cancel the exercise due to the damage to its secretariat, materials and equipment meant for CVR. Reacting to the call, the Edo INEC’s head of Voters Education and Publicity, Timidi Wariowei, said it is unfair to lay such an allegation against the election umpire. Tenebe said the stakeholders meeting held on May 16 at the INEC office in Benin was meant to take care of issues relating, noting that it was wrong to lay such an accusation on the doorstep of the commission. The CVR exercise monitored in Oredo, Egor and Ikpoba-Okha local government showed that PVC collection was also ongoing side-by-side with the continuous voter registration exercise. Speaking at the Ikpoba-Okha registration area, the INEC National Commissioner in charge of Edo, Delta and Cross River, Rhoda Gumus, expressed satisfaction with the exercise while urging the registrants to be patient, adding that they will all be registered. Gumus said, “We have been to Oredo and we are here at the Ikpoba-Okha registration area which we are using as our state head office registration centre because of the flood disaster that happened at our head office on Friday. “We are in touch with other registration areas within and outside Benin and the exercise is going on smoothly. As you can see, we have registered some people and others are still waiting. The process just started today. It is impressive and commendable, ” she said. The state Resident Electoral Commissioner, Anugbum Onuoha said that INEC was well prepared for the exercise, adding that the flood disaster that destroyed some of the commission’s equipment could not stop the exercise. Onuoha said, ” We thank God for the enablement to begin this exercise, having in mind the flood disaster that destroyed some of our equipment on Friday. Due to the flood disaster, we moved our head office registration area to the INEC office at Ikpoba-Okha local government. “We are here and witnessing a large turnout of people who are here as either new registrants or to transfer their registration or for PVC collection. INEC is prepared for this exercise and nothing will make us fail. People expected us to discontinue the exercise but we were prepared even before the flood disaster happened. “Yes, we had some initial network problems but it has been resolved and the exercise is going on smoothly and by the grace of God, the exercise will be successful.” The state acting chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Jarret Tenebe in a statement on Sunday, urged INEC to cancel the exercise due to the damage to its secretariat, materials and equipment meant for CVR. The APC had on Friday at a press conference in Benin alleged that the People’s Democratic Party and INEC were conniving to manipulate the CVR in favour of the PDP. The party also said that the CVR’s manipulation was the beginning of moves to rig the election in favour of the PDP.",

        "content": "The Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja on Monday, dismissed the petition filed by Peoples Redemption Party (PRP), challenging the election victory of Governor Usman Ododo in the Nov. 11, 2023 Kogi governorship poll. The three-member panel, chaired by Justice Ado Birnin–Kudu, dismissed the petition on the grounds that the petitioners; PRP and its governorship candidate, Abdullahi Bayawo, failed to prove the allegations of non-compliance with the provisions of the Electoral Act, 2022 during the poll. The tribunal, in a unanimous judgment, held that the petitioners’ evidence that Forms EC8B and EC8D (the ward result sheets and the state result sheets) tendered were not prepared for the Nov. 11, 2023 poll, were bereft of substance. The panel said that the testimonies of the petitioners’ witnesses were hearsay and that failure to call polling agents from the alleged affected polling units to give their evidence was fatal to the case of the petitioners. Besides, it held that some of the evidence of the witnesses had no probative value. “The petition lacks merit and it is accordingly dismissed,” Justice Birnin–Kudu-led tribunal declared. It held that the election that produced Ododo of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as governor of Kogi complied substantially with the provisions of the Electoral Act . Earlier, the tribunal dismissed the petition filed by Social Democratic Party (SDP) and its governorship candidate, Murtala Ajaka, against Gov. Ododo. The tribunal held that the petitioners also failed to prove the allegations of over-voting and non-compliance with the Electoral Act, 2022 in the petition. The panel, in a unanimous, decision held that all the witness evidence filed before it were incompetent and full of inconsistencies. It also agreed with the submissions of the respondents that the allegations of forgery raised in the petition were pre-election matter, which ought to have been raised 14 days after the documents were submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission. It would be recalled that the tribunal had, on Feb. 20, struck out the petition filed by the Action Peoples Party (APP) against the election victory of Ododo in the Nov. 11 governorship poll in the state. The panel struck out the petition following its withdrawal by counsel for APP, Daniel Edeachi. The application, seeking the withdrawal of the petition was not opposed by lawyer to Gov. Ododo, Ibrahim Muhammed, SAN; counsel to APC, DC Denwigwe, SAN, and that of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Kanu Agabi, SAN. The APP had, in the petition number: EPR/KG/GOV/02/2023 filed on Dec. 1, 2023, before the tribunal, challenged the declaration of Ododo as the validly elected governor of Kogi in the Nov. 11, 2023 governorship poll conducted by INEC. The party had sued Ododo, APC and INEC as 1st to 3rd respondents respectively. However, in its motion on notice dated and filed on Feb. 15, the party sought two orders, including an order granting leave to the petitioner/applicant to withdraw the Petition No: EPT/KG/GOV/01/2023 and an order striking out or dismissing the petition, having been withdrawn by the petitioner. Giving eight-ground of argument, APP said though it filed the petition to challenge Ododo’s victory, the party said upon the re-evaluation of the grounds and facts of the petition, it “is not reasonably convinced about the sustainability of the grounds of the petition as presently constituted before this honourable tribunal. According to the party, the withdrawal of the petition is based on the perceived unsustainability of the grounds of the petition and to avoid overburdening this honourable tribunal with numerous petitions.(NAN) The OPINION / COLUMN is authored by independent contributors to the National Accord Newspaper .

        "content": "The Dragons' Den team rejected Katherine Swift's matcha tea investment proposal (Image: BBC) The Dragons' Den judges warned they struggled to see how Katherine Swift's anti-cancer wellness tea could make it in the \"mainstream\" market - but now she seems to be proving them wrong. She is now expected to rake in more than 20 times the annual profit she started off achieving when the business first began ten years ago. The events manager turned entrepreneur's business began by accident after she developed a passion for Japanese matcha tea and became intrigued by its health benefits. She was left heartbroken after her mum was diagnosed with breast cancer back in 2009 - but she took control of her anxiety and channelled it into finding wellness opportunities. Katherine was tasked with helping to run the £5 million charity appeal for Breakthrough Breast Cancer - and that led to a chance meeting with a professor. He was studying whether antioxidants and amino acids found in matcha tea could slow down the growth of cancer stem cells in those battling the potentially fatal disease. Of course, Katherine was instantly interested in having some samples shipped over from Japan to taste the feel-good effect herself. \"My mum and I tried drinking it and it made us feel great, it just gave us a mental and physical boost of energy,\" she revealed to The Sun. function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) \"I started thinking I loved it so much I wanted to spread the word, and that's where I got the idea to start my own matcha tea business!\" In 2014, OMG Tea (Organic Matcha Green Tea) was born - and the public reaction gave her the \"confidence to keep pursuing it\".

Katherine was approached by Dragons' Den the following year to appear on the BBC show, but there was disappointment in store when she made her TV debut. She pitched her idea to the Dragons in the hope of securing an investment that would help her to grow the business, but to no avail.

Using £20,000 of her own savings, she took the \"big risk\" of trying to grow her business alone - and it paid off. In 2023, she doubled her annual profits from £250,000 to £500,000 - and this year she thinks she's on track to make £1 million. Reflecting that the drink is now available at Starbucks, she explained: \"I wanted to basically bring matcha to the masses...

        "content": "After a home victory last night, Luka Doncic, Kyrie Irving and the Dallas Mavericks are one game away from the NBA finals. They're up 3-0 on the Minnesota Timberwolves after stealing both games on the road and they'll get the chance to sweep the Western Conference Finals series tomorrow at home. As deep playoff runs tend to, it's sparked discussion about the legacies of some of the central players. That included , who is weighing in on Kyrie Irving. Kyrie has played spectacularly in the series and will almost certainly get the chance to play for his second ring in this year's finale. While especially after his game-winning shot in Game 2, Kyrie's status is also being re-assessed. Irving continues to be a controversial figure in NBA circles mostly for . While there he made multiple controversial public comments that led to him being accused of antisemitism. The first headline Budden shares reads \"He's your headache now\" to which he captions \"best headache ever.\" Check out all the posts he made reasessing old Kyrie posts below. The Western Conference Finals isn't the only series currently sitting at 3-0. Earlier this week the Boston Celtics took a commanding lead over the Indiana Pacers after stealing Game 3 on the road. Jayson Tatum's Celtics remain undefeated on the road through this point in the playoffs having won 5 road games already. Later today Boston will have the chance to sweep the series. The status of the Pacers star player Haliburton still up in the air. No team has ever come back from a 0-3 deficit in an NBA conference final series. What do you think of Joe Budden holding onto receipts about Kyrie Irving now that the Mavs are approaching the NBA Finals? Do you agree with him that the perception around Kyrie should shift because of this playoff run? Let us know in the comment section below. [ ]",

        "content": "Time is running out to find survivors of a huge landslide that buried many hundreds of people in a remote Papua New Guinea village as Australia prepares a $2.5 million aid package to assist. or signup to continue reading PNG's National Disaster Centre said more than 2000 people had been buried alive by Friday's landslide in remote Enga province. Australia will send technical experts and $2.5 million in initial aid to PNG as the death toll continues to rise following the catastrophic landslide. Under the Australian aid package experts will provide incident management assistance, support geo-hazard assessments and help early recovery efforts, with the Australian Defence Force also assisting. \"As a close neighbour and friend, we will be doing all we can to provide support,\" Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles said in a statement late on Monday. Treacherous terrain in the region and difficulty getting in aid has hampered rescue efforts, raising fears few survivors will be found. Australia is ready to consider additional support beyond Monday's announcement, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said. \"(This) package will assist the urgent needs of those affected by this devastating landslide,\" she said. The head of the International Organisation for Migration in PNG Serhan Aktoprak said the conditions on the ground were hampering rescue and aid efforts. Rocks were still falling from the mountain, soil was cracking and water was flowing under the debris. \"We're just hoping that in the remaining short window of time that we have, we can at least contribute to the relief efforts in saving some more lives,\" Mr Aktoprak said. \"But unfortunately, (time) is not on our side.\" Mr Marles said Australia would continue to work with PNG officials as to how best to deliver aid. A spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the reported loss of hundreds of lives. \"He extends his heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and expresses his solidarity with the people and government of Papua New Guinea,\" the spokesperson said. \"The United Nations and its partners are supporting the government's response efforts.

        "content": "A rapid-fire probe into gendered-violence prevention has been launched following a sharp rise in the number of women killed this year. $ 0 / (min cost $ 0 ) Login or signup to continue reading A team of experts on gender-based violence, social policy, diversity and inclusion, men's mental health and the justice system has been assembled to offer practical advice to the federal government. The first part of the research will be completed by the end of June. A number of high-profile cases involving women who were killed by men they knew has sparked public outcry and put the government under pressure to do more. Social Services Minister Amanda Rishworth said one life lost to intimate partner homicide was one too many. \"In order to reach our shared goal of ending violence against women and children in one generation we must have a considered focus on perpetrator intervention and prevention activities,\" she said in a statement. Labor has promised to end violence against women and children in one generation. The newly-assembled panel will consider all opportunities to intervene and prevent incidents, including \"stronger accountability and consequences for people who choose to use violence\". Shifting attitudes and accelerating that process will also be investigated. Australia's Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence Commissioner Micaela Cronin, Commonwealth Office for Women executive director Padma Raman and Department of Social Services secretary Ray Griggs will co-convene the panel. Leigh Gassner, assistant commissioner at Victoria Police, will also be on the panel, as will journalist and coercive control educator Jess Hill, along with other experts from relevant fields. In Australia, one-in-five women and one-in-16 men have experienced sexual violence since the age of 15. Women were most likely to experience harm at the hands of an intimate partner. National cabinet held an emergency meeting earlier in May on domestic violence prevention. Following the meeting, the government pledged more than $900 million to make permanent a program to provide one-off $5000 payments to women fleeing violence. 1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732) Lifeline 13 11 14 Australian Associated Press",

        "content": "A rapid-fire probe into gendered-violence prevention has been launched following a sharp rise in the number of women killed this year. or signup to continue reading A team of experts on gender-based violence, social policy, diversity and inclusion, men's mental health and the justice system has been assembled to offer practical advice to the federal government. The first part of the research will be completed by the end of June. A number of high-profile cases involving women who were killed by men they knew has sparked public outcry and put the government under pressure to do more. Social Services Minister Amanda Rishworth said one life lost to intimate partner homicide was one too many. \"In order to reach our shared goal of ending violence against women and children in one generation we must have a considered focus on perpetrator intervention and prevention activities,\" she said in a statement. Labor has promised to end violence against women and children in one generation. The newly-assembled panel will consider all opportunities to intervene and prevent incidents, including \"stronger accountability and consequences for people who choose to use violence\". Shifting attitudes and accelerating that process will also be investigated. Australia's Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence Commissioner Micaela Cronin, Commonwealth Office for Women executive director Padma Raman and Department of Social Services secretary Ray Griggs will co-convene the panel. Leigh Gassner, assistant commissioner at Victoria Police, will also be on the panel, as will journalist and coercive control educator Jess Hill, along with other experts from relevant fields.

        "content": "Katie Price, 46, is slammed for 'disappointing' behaviour on stage as she encourages son Harvey, 22, to say the C-word repeatedly in front of thousands By Melody Fletcher For Mailonline Published: 18:15, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 18:32, 27 May 2024 e-mail 63 View comments Katie Price has been slammed for her 'disappointing' behaviour on stage at her show in London on Friday. The former glamour model, 46, made an appearance at The Clapham Grand with her sister Sophie, 34, for the latest stop on her podcast tour The Katie Price Show. However, the ex-Page 3 girl was slammed by her devoted fans who watched her encourage son Harvey, 22, to say the C-word repeatedly in front of thousands of people. It isn't the first time Harvey has dropped the C-word in front of a large audience, as in 2016 the then-then 13-year-old went viral or saying it during an interview about trolling on Loose Women . In exclusive new footage obtained by MailOnline, Katie is seen prompting Harvey to say the c-word by referring to a previous time he said it. Katie goes up to Harvey, who is blind, autistic, has septo-optic dysplasia and a learning disability, and asks: 'What was the naught word when you were on TV with Piers Morgan ? What did you say?' Katie Price has been slammed for her 'disappointing' behaviour on stage at her show in London on Friday The ex-Page 3 girl was slammed by her devoted fans who watched her encourage son Harvey, 22, to say the C-word repeatedly in front of thousands of people Harvey responds: 'Hi Piers Morgan you bl***y c***' Katie then put the microphone back to his mouth, with Harvey once again saying: 'Hello you c***' One audience member was 'shocked and disappointed' by Katie's behaviour on stage, telling MailOnline exclusively: 'I don't know what I was more shocked about, the fact that a mum was egging her son, regardless of his age, to use such a profanity on stage, or the fact that she said \"well done\" after he done it! 'As a mum myself I was so disturbed. Although the audience were laughing at the time, when we were all walking out, fans were expressing how disappointed they were that Harvey seemed to be used as a prop in the live show for a cheap laugh. 'Katie appears to be such a fantastic mum, so seeing something like this live is extremely disappointing.' Katie shares Harvey with former Premier League footballer Dwight Yorke, but claims he has only seen their son aroundseven times in his life . Katie's fans were already outraged on the night as she she turned up to the show an hour late. The TV personality's fans have dubbed her tardiness 'rude' and 'unprofessional'. After revealing their frustration, one audience member told The Sun : 'Some of us had travelled from quite a while away to see her and had long journeys back home. It isn't the first time Harvey has dropped the C-word in front of a large audience, as in 2016 the then-then 13-year-old went viral or saying it during an interview about trolling on Loose Women Katie's fans were already outraged on the night as she she turned up to the show an hour late 'We were all sitting there twiddling our thumbs, hoping she would come out on stage. The waiting seemed to go on forever. 'Why couldn't she have just started the show at the advertised time? It's honestly so unprofessional and rude. I don't think I'll ever see her live again.' Despite frustrating fans with her late arrival , Katie appeared in top spirits after the show as she left smiling with her son Harvey, 21. She was then spotted happily jumping into a car with her boyfriend JJ Slater. To see one of Katie's live podcast shows, fans had to fork out £29 per ticket. Although the entry fee was relatively cheap compared to her competitors, she could not fill the venue, which could seat up to 700 people. Fan pictures showed that the venue still had a lot of empty seats by the time the show started. In a desperate bid to put bottoms on seats, the mother-of-five offered her dedicated fans a discount and started to flog her tickets online for £10. But while it also appears that she will not fill her next 400-capacity venue in Birmingham, there is still hope for her in Bristol, Glasgow and Newcastle. Katie and Sophie launched the podcast in the summer in a bid to get the cash flowing again after being made bankrupt twice. During her show on Wednesday she left her fans stunned when she took to the stage to perform a song during her podcast show in Birmingham . She made sure it was indeed The Katie Price Show as she burst into a song for the audience. Katie, who shocked fans for 'having a really good voice', brushed off her recent financial woes as her first night of her podcast show kicked off. She slipped into a skimpy pink playsuit covered with her face on it and wore a dazzling silver crown with thigh-high latex pink boots. It comes after Katie revealed the 'real reason' behind her whopping tax bill since it was revealed she is being evicted from her Mucky Mansion She said she 'didn't even know' she was declared bankrupt a second time - despite failing to pay over £750,000 to HMRC Katie opened up on her financial woes on the Stripping Off With Matt Haycox and disclosed the truth behind her bankruptcy She had the whole audience dancing along during her performance, despite struggling to hit most of the right notes. While some fans were gobsmacked over surprisingly good performance, others were not in agreement. The majority of fans flooded Katie's Instagram comments with positive messages following her performance, writing: 'Your voice is really good!' Where another fans couldn't quite believe their eyes, penning: 'Total cringe!!!!' It comes after Katie revealed the 'real reason' behind her whopping tax bill since it was revealed she is being evicted from her Mucky Mansion. She said she 'didn't even know' she was declared bankrupt a second time - despite failing to pay over £750,000 to HMRC. Opened up on her financial woes on the Stripping Off podcast with Matt Haycox , Katie disclosed the truth behind her bankruptcy. Katie blamed 'lawyers and divorces' for the root cause of her bankruptcy, but insisted she 'will pay' what she owes 'when she has it'. She said: 'Yeah, you should always pay your tax, this and that. But obviously I went through a breakdown so then I didn't pay tax and that's sort of where the bankruptcy thing has come from. 'I will pay it but it just has to be when I've got it.' She added: 'I pay the mum and dad role, I've got bills to pay, I've got outgoings, I've got to live. 'I feel good, because I'm in control whereas before, other people controlled it.' Despite admitting she has been turning down work because she is getting too much, Katie told Matt she had no idea about her double bankruptcy. She said: 'Apparently I'm in another one, I didn't even know about that.' Katie has been open about her financial struggles and revealed on Monday that she is having a 'yard sale' as she begins clearing out her Mucky Mansion amid her bankruptcy woes Katie has been open about her financial struggles and revealed on Monday that she is having a 'yard sale' as she begins clearing out her Mucky Mansion amid her bankruptcy woes . She was informed by lawyers earlier this month that she would have to move out of the property in in Dial Post, West Sussex, by May 29, after two eviction notices appeared outside her home. Katie's Mucky Mansion has caused the star problems for years and last October the she struggled to rent the house out due to it being 'mouldy' and 'haunted'. Earlier this month it was revealed Katie was due to be evicted from the property. The first eviction letter, dated April 24, revealed that 'the eviction will take place on May 29th, 2024, at 10am'. The eviction order from Horsham County Court, addressed to Katie and 'any other occupiers', instructs her 'to arrange to leave the property with [her] belongings before this time and date'. A spokesman for the star has denied that she will be kicked out at the end of the month. In a statement to The Sun on Sunday night, they said: 'Kate will not be evicted from her property on 29th May,' but would not confirm or deny if Katie was being evicted. The TV personality paid £1.35m for the property in Horsham, West Sussex in October 2014, which boasts some 12.25 acres of land, a swimming pool, tennis courts, stables and paddocks. But, the home subsequently fell into disrepair, leading to her 2022 Channel 4 show, Katie Price's Mucky Mansion, which saw Katie attempt to renovate the 19-room property . In 2022, her ex-fiancé Carl Woods had been using the garden as a vehicle forecourt for his used car sales business prior to the latest update on the home. Despite the legal notices, Katie insists she isn't being evicted as she told listeners on the latest episode of her The Katie Price Show podcast: 'My house isn't being repossessed. 'I'm not being evicted and I'm not moving into a caravan, although if I had to live in a caravan, you know what the travellers have, I would love that. 'I'll also have another announcement to make on the 28th, bring it on sunshine.' Katie recently claimed that she has been signed off from appearing in court for her mental health, after receiving backlash for missing her last bankruptcy hearing in April to go on holiday to Cyprus with Married At First Sight UK star JJ . She had been due to give evidence about her finances at the High Court, but at the start of the hearing, lawyers said that she had told them at the last minute she couldn't attend due to health issues. A judge described this excuse as 'scanty'. Katie then jetted off on holiday to Ayia Napa with her MAFS star boyfriend, facing public backlash after being spotted sunbathing together by the pool . Taking to her podcast, The Katie Price Show, Katie hit back and claimed she had been signed off from court because she was 'mentally not strong enough'. She was informed by lawyers earlier this month that she would have to move out of the property in in Dial Post, West Sussex, by May 29, after two eviction notices appeared outside her home Taking to Instagram on Monday, Katie shared a clip showing a huge pile of things in her living room that she was set to sell She said: 'Everyone is like 'oh she's missed bankruptcy and she's gone on holiday!' No, let me address it... 'The court knew that I wasn't going to my bankruptcy, because mentally - my consultant at The Priory - I've been signed off for any kind of activity for court. She went on: 'I am taking my bankruptcy so serious, like I do everything else. It's a very serious situation I'm in and it does look like 'oh she's just gone on holiday'... 'No, my head at the moment needs a break. I had four days in my diary where I was able to go away. When I say I'm not mentally able and stable to stand in court at the moment because I have a lot of things going on behind the scenes I'm dealing with... 'I'm mentally not strong enough at the moment to stand in court, be cross examined in front of the media and public.' The court heard that Katie's personal assistant had sent a statement from a consultant psychiatrist saying she had anxiety and depression , as well as other issues affecting her mental health. Barristers for the trustees of Katie's first bankruptcy asked the judge to order her attendance at a future hearing and said she should be 'on notice' that she could be arrested if she did not attend. Katie's Financial Woes 2019 - Katie was declared bankrupt with debts of £3.2m from her failed company Jordan Trading Ltd, that was set up to oversee her perfume and cosmetics line. She set up the company in 2003 but in 2017 an application was put in to wind up the company as she tried to sort out her finances. When she was declared bankrupt she vowed to pay back £12,000 a month to creditors of the firm through an individual voluntary arrangement. The bankruptcy meant Katie, once worth a reported £45million, faced losing her £2million 11-bedroom mansion . She took out a second mortgage on the property in 2015, but faced monthly payments of £12,300. 2022 - The former model had been due to attend the Royal Court of Justice to explain to a judge why she has failed to repay millions owed to creditors. However, the hearing was adjourned at the last minute with her solicitors giving no reason for Katie's no show before the court. March 2024 - She was again declared bankrupt over an unpaid tax bill of £761,994.05. The demand for payment was made by HMRC in October 2023. A court was told the bill 'derives from self-assessments' for 2020-2021 and 2021-22 and includes income VAT, tax, surcharges and interest. Insolvency and Companies Court Judge Sebastian Prentis told the hearing at London's Rolls Building: 'There has been no response from the debtor. The papers are in order. 'There is a substantial debt due from Ms Price to HMRC and therefore I will make a bankruptcy order.' May 2024 - Katie is evicted from her home after being served with a notice and given weeks to leave. She is told bailiffs will arrive at 10am on 29 May to ensure she and any other occupants have vacated the property.

        "description": "The mother of a schoolgirl whose body was found inside a barrel with gunshot wounds will testify for a second day in the murder trial of her former partner.",
        "content": "Kallista Mutten could face claims that she shot her own daughter Charlise as she continues giving evidence in the murder trial of her former partner. or signup to continue reading Justin Stein's trial continues in the NSW Supreme Court on Tuesday with Ms Mutten returning for a second day of testimony. Stein, 33, has pleaded not guilty to murdering nine-year-old Charlise, claiming he witnessed Ms Mutten shoot her own daughter. Charlise's body was found by police in a barrel by the Blue Mountains' Colo River on January 18, 2022 with gunshot wounds to her face and back. Following a full day of evidence on Monday, Ms Mutten will now face cross-examination by Stein's lawyer, Carolyn Davenport SC. The court heard last week that following his arrest, Stein told a corrections officer he was traumatised after seeing Ms Mutten shoot the girl. \"I heard a shot and then I heard her screaming out for me. Then I ran back and she shot her again,\" Stein said, according to the officer. Ms Davenport told the jury during her opening address that it would become apparent Ms Mutten, not Stein, had motive to kill the girl. At the time of her death, Charlise had been visiting her mother and Stein over the Christmas holidays from Tweed Heads, where she lived full-time with her grandparents. During the visit, the group spent their time between a Mount Wilson property owned by Stein's mother, and a caravan at the Riviera Ski Park about a 90-minute drive away. The trial heard earlier from neighbours of the Mount Wilson property who said they heard conversations regarding Charlise's parental custody which hinted at plans not to send her back to Queensland. One neighbour had previously attended a dinner with his wife and mother-in-law where Stein, his mother, Charlise and her mother were also present. \"(Stein) said that if anything happened and the child didn't go back to Queensland that he would end up in prison again,\" the neighbour said. During her evidence on Monday, Ms Mutten told the trial she saw her daughter for the last time on January 11, when the nine-year-old travelled alone to spend the night with Stein at Mount Wilson while she remained at the caravan park. She said the following day Stein told her he left Charlise in the care of an auctioneer who was working at the Blue Mountains property where they were staying. Stein claimed Charlise had been vomiting and was too unwell to travel, and that she was in good hands because the woman was a mother of three and \"practically a nurse\", the court was told. Stein later said he believed the woman was not who she said she was and that Charlise may have taken by former associates from his criminal past. \"I said, 'we should go to police',\" Ms Mutten told the court through tears. \"He said, 'no, because if you ring the police they will kill her'.\" On January 13, while phone data tracked Stein allegedly travelling to three boat ramps across Sydney and eventually the exact location where Charlise's body was found, Ms Mutten believed he was \"going to war\" to find her daughter, the court heard. \"Justin said he's gonna go to war and go to places that he might think that she might be and go look for her and get her,\" Ms Mutten said. Later, she said, \"Justin had called me and said that he 'badly hurt' the man that was in the house (where) he thought Charlise was ... and stabbed him\". When he returned in the early hours of the next day, Ms Mutten says Stein told her, \"It's not them, you can call the police in the morning\". Ms Mutten called police to report her daughter missing shortly after 8am the next morning. Advertisement Sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date. We care about the protection of your data.

        "content": "(TEL AVIV, Israel) — Israel faced new condemnation Monday for strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah that local health officials said killed at least 45 Palestinians, including displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there had been a “tragic mistake” and that Israel was investigating. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas, with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel said it was looking into the civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night’s attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. In a speech before Israel’s parliament on Monday, Netanyahu said that “despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake. We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers “pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. The Gaza Health Ministry said around half of the dead were women, children and older adults. On Monday, barefoot children poked at the blackened debris as searches continued. France, a close European ally of Israel, said it was “outraged” by the violence. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza’s population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said bombings like the one in Rafah will have long-standing repercussions for Israel. “Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,′′ he told Italy’s SKY TG24 news channel. Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the strikes could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strikes. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry described the strike on Tel al-Sultan as a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "description": "In March 2004, two months before the American public had seen a single frame of “Super Size Me,” McDonald’s announced it had begun phasing out the “super size” option. Was the chain anticipating a public backlash? Maybe.",
        "content": "“Super Size Me” is yet one more example of how storytelling — even imperfect storytelling — has the ability to move mountains, at least a little. Mountains like McDonald’s. The 20-year-old documentary was a cautionary tale about obesity in America. Written, produced, and directed by filmmaker Morgan Spurlock , who died of cancer Thursday at age 53, “Super Size Me” was a controversial experiment in human endurance: Spurlock put himself on a restricted diet of all McDonald’s, all the time: three meals a day from Feb. 1 to March 2, 2003. He would “super size” his order whenever asked if he wanted the larger portion. He would also limit his exercise to walking about 1.5 miles a day. “What would happen if I ate nothing but McDonald’s for 30 days straight? Would I suddenly be on the fast track to becoming an obese American? Would it be unreasonably dangerous?” Spurlock asks in the documentary. “Let’s find out. I’m ready. Super size me!” He would gain nearly 25 pounds, see his cholesterol jump, and suffer from mood swings and depression. The mood at McDonald’s probably wasn’t much better at the time. Even before the film was released in May 2004, the burger giant appeared to be squirming in its special sauce. In March 2004, two months before the American public had seen a single frame of “Super Size Me,” McDonald’s announced it had begun phasing out the “super size” option. Was the chain anticipating a public backlash? Maybe. Perhaps more telling was the introduction of McDonald’s “Go Active!” Happy Meal, a boxed meal complete with an image of young woman in workout clothes, stretching her right leg. Described at the time as an “adult Happy Meal,” the “Go Active!” box included a salad, bottled water, a pedometer, and some advice on walking more. It was part of a coordinated campaign to make McDonald’s food more appealing to health-conscious diners. Advertisement The nationwide rollout of the “Go Active!” Happy Meal was May 6, according to contemporary reports. This was, incidentally, just one day before “Super Size Me” appeared in movie theaters. McDonald’s indicated the menu changes and additions were “in response to a call by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services this year for the private sector to help fight obesity,” according to an Associated Press story at the time. There was no mention in the AP story of an upcoming indie film that would eventually gross $22 million and earn an Academy Award nomination for best documentary. You could reasonably argue that McDonald’s was just responding to the cultural zeitgeist of the early aughts, when many were lobbying for a healthier American diet. I mean, no company the size of McDonald’s can make menu changes without a lot of preparation: It can take many months to coordinate supply chains, order new packaging materials and create marketing plans. Then again, making a movie takes time, too. Spurlock had filmed his adventures in fast-food gluttony more than a year before the documentary actually dropped. Does anyone think McDonald’s was unaware of the film’s production and its potential impact on sales? McDonald’s even issued a press release shortly after the debut of “Super Size Me.” Some of the pertinent sections have been preserved online by folks who study the cultural impact of film. This one paragraph stood out: Advertisement “This movie is all about one individual’s decision to act irresponsibly by consuming more than 5,000 calories a day — twice the recommended level for adult males — and by purposely limiting his physical activity. That’s why this movie makes no contribution to the important dialogue taking place today on nutrition and balanced lifestyles.” The company is making a perfectly legitimate point, one echoed by others at the time. (Spurlock also acknowledged later, in a #MeToo mea culpa, that he hadn’t been sober for more than a week for 30 years, casting doubt on how much alcohol contributed to his health issues in 2003.) But let’s be realistic here, too: McDonald’s was attacking the messenger, the hallmark of any institution under siege. And let’s not forget: Even in 2004, few people needed a documentary to know that they could encounter excess at McDonald’s. A Double Quarter Pounder With Cheese combo meal, with medium fries and a Coke, clocks in at 1260 calories, with more saturated fat in one meal than is recommended for an entire day. McDonald’s would take another swing at Spurlock and his documentary ahead of the film’s release in Britain later in 2004. The company launched an “unconventional campaign” with national newspaper advertisements that came across as an attack on McDonald’s itself, according to a piece in the Guardian from August 2004. “What may surprise you is how much of the film we agree with,” the ad says, according to the Guardian. “We do agree with ... its core argument, that if you eat too much and do too little, it’s bad for you.” The ad went on to note that it would take the average Mickey D’s customer six years to eat the amount that Spurlock wolfed down in 30 days. Advertisement In the two decades since “Super Size Me” hit theaters, the fortunes of the filmmaker and McDonald’s have gone in opposite directions. After his admission of sexual misconduct, Spurlock described himself as part of the #MeToo problem and resigned from his production company, Warrior Poets. McDonald’s, meanwhile, continues unabated. Its sales are up. So is its stock price, at least relative to its value in 2004. Reported the New York Times this month: “The stock price of McDonald’s hit an all-time high in January, and has gone up nearly 1,000 percent since ‘Super Size Me’ came out — nearly twice the return of the S&P 500.” You know what else is up? American obesity rates. I don’t know what this says about America. Maybe that storytelling, in the end, is no match for the salt, sugar, fat, and marketing prowess of McDonald’s.",

        "content": "May 27, (THEWILL) – The Bayelsa State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal, in Abuja, has declared Douye Diri of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as duly elected Bayelsa State governor. A three-member panel of Justices, led by Adekunle Adeleye, upheld the victory of Diri in the November 11, 2023, gubernatorial election and dismissed as lacking in merit, the petition that was brought before it by the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate, Timipre Sylva. In its unanimous decision, the tribunal held that the petitioners failed to adduce any credible evidence to substantiate any of the allegations they raised against the outcome of the election. Consequently, the tribunal struck out as incompetent, all the additional proof of evidence, as well as statements on oath of some of the witnesses that testified for the petitioners. According to the tribunal, the law expressly provided that an election petition must be filed not later than 21 days after the result of an election was declared. It held that such a petition must be accompanied by written statements of all the intended witnesses at the time it was filed. The tribunal held that the decision of Sylva and his party to file their additional proof of evidence and statement on oath of witnesses, long after they had filed the petition, was “tantamount to a surreptitious attempt to amend the case of the petitioners.” The tribunal further dismissed the allegation that the deputy governor, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, tendered a forged University Degree Certificate and NYSC Exemption Certificate, to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in aid of his qualification to contest the election. It held that the allegation was a pre-election matter that ought to be litigated before the Federal High Court, adding that the matter had become statute-barred since the petitioners failed to challenge the genuineness of the certificates, 14 days after it was submitted to INEC. The tribunal held that a court of competent jurisdiction previously determined the issue of Ewhrudjakpo’s educational qualification. Holding that the petitioners were unable to discharge the burden of proof that was placed on them by the law, the three justices unanimously dismissed the petition and declared Duoye Diri of the PDP, the duly elected governor of Bayelsa.",

        "content": "Dear Coleen I have a son who is 30 and he lives with me, along with his daughter. He has full custody and she doesn’t see her mum. I love my son, but he’s on the autistic spectrum, has severe ADHD and mental health issues, and is very hard work. From the age of 17 he’s tried to self-medicate with cocaine . He’s been clean for a year, but it’s damaged him. My issue is the way he treats me. He makes me cry a lot and knocks my self-confidence. I’ve had breast cancer , so I’m on medication for 10 years, which has forced me into menopause, and with that comes terrible sweats and moods. It’s also affected my weight and I’ve gone from size 12 to 16. My son calls me sweaty and fat, has no empathy and has even told me he hopes I get cancer again and die. I know he doesn’t mean it, but it hurts. I used to have loads of confidence. I was in the Army for eight years then a prison officer for 20 years. I was medically retired 10 years ago after two bad assaults left me with leg and back injuries. I got a little concierge job and four masked men armed with sledgehammers robbed the place, tied me up and locked me in the toilet. I seem to be a magnet for this kind of thing! Now I don’t work, I have my prison pension and just look after my granddaughter. My son doesn’t appreciate what I’ve been through or what I do for them both. I’ve thought of throwing him out, but I couldn’t do that to my granddaughter. I’m only 54 and want to do so much more. Dunelm's 'most comfortable' hanging egg chair is 'perfect for British weather' Coleen says Well, if it wasn’t for your granddaughter, I’d be encouraging you to get away and live your life. But I do appreciate that’s not possible right now. Look, this isn’t a great environment for your granddaughter. It’s horrible and damaging for her to see her dad treat you like this, and you have to point this out to him. What kind of father and role model does he want to be? She needs to learn about healthy relationships and respect for other people. Try to talk to him about this when he’s not in one of his angry moods. And suggest he talks to his doctor to find out if there are any options in terms of medication or counselling. As for you, you’re clearly a woman who’s doing everything for everyone else and nothing for yourself. You’ve had a tough time and come through it all, and you deserve some peace. As difficult as it is, you must find a way to make time for yourself to show yourself some love and kindness. Could your mum or a friend help with childcare occasionally? The positive thing is, your son is clean and working, so it’s all about building on that. Frankie Bridge fans obsessed with 'amazing' £45 linen River Island dress",

        "description": "NBA Hall of Fame center Bill Walton has died. He was 71 years old.",
        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. Video above: Remembering those we've lost in 2024 He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. \"Bill Walton,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, \"was truly one of a kind.\" Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. \"One of my guards said, 'Let's try something else,\" Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden's response during that timeout: \"Why? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. \"It's very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA's program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. \"As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It's hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.\"",

Campus security told the Canberra protesters to clear the area early on Monday following a directive from ANU. However, the students dug their heels in and put out a call for support from the community. More than 100 people showed up to support the camp as protesters linked arms around the tents to stop anyone from entering. As pressure mounted to make a decision on whether to stay or leave as the police presence grew, protesting students held a vote in which an overwhelming majority voted to stay. The ANU pro-Palestine encampment is demanding the university cut ties with weapons manufacturing companies, disclose and divest from all entities complicit in the \"genocide in Gaza\" and cut academic ties with Israel. The university maintains it has never told the students to stop protesting but they must move to another area to avoid safety risks to all students on the campus. The encampment currently sits in a main evacuation route for the campus and a failed evacuation on Wednesday highlighted \"intolerable risk to students, staff and wider public\". \"Everyone at ANU shares the same sense of responsibility for the safety and wellbeing of our community,\" the university said in a statement. Students at the encampment say the university has refused to meet with them to discuss a compromise before they were surprised with an eviction notice early Monday morning. On October 7, designated terrorist group Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1200 people and taking more than 200 hostages, according to Tel Aviv. Israel retaliated, launching a bombing campaign and counter-offensive in Gaza that, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, has killed nearly 36,000 Palestinians, injured more than 80,000 and displaced more than 1.7 million.

        "description": "Two-time NBA champion and Hall of Famer Bill Walton has died of cancer at the age of 71, the NBA announced Monday.",
        "content": "Basketball legend Bill Walton, who led the to two national titles before winning two championships during his NBA career, has died at the age of 71 after a prolonged battle with cancer. The NBA issued a statement saying Walton died Monday while surrounded by his family. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season and a member of both the NBA's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year under iconic coach John Wooden. \"What I will remember most about him was his zest for life, Silver said in his statement. \"He was a regular presence at league events -- always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered. \"As a cherished member of the NBA family for 50 years, Bill will be deeply missed by all those who came to know and love him.\" Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life on the court, off the court and during his broadcasting career. His NBA career -- disrupted by chronic foot injuries -- lasted only 468 games with , the San Diego and eventually and . He averaged a double-double in those games -- 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. However, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against , in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. The Bruins kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. \"It's very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA's program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. \"As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It's hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.\" Walton originally joined ESPN and ABC in 2002 as a lead analyst for NBA games before shifting to college basketball in 2012. He also worked for CBS and NBC and was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all-time by the American Sportscasters Association in 2009. \"As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position,\" Silver said. \"Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans.\" The first overall pick of the 1974 NBA draft by the Trail Blazers, the 6-foot-11 Walton played 10 seasons in the NBA, winning championships with the Blazers (1977) and the Celtics (1986). He averaged a double-double over his career, totaling 6,215 points (13.3 per game), 4,923 rebounds (10.5 per game), 1,034 blocks (2.2 per game) and 1,590 assists. A two-time All-Star, he led the NBA in rebounding and blocks in 1977 and was the league's Sixth Man of the Year in 1986.",

May was arrested on May 18 after police allege he assaulted the woman on April 8 by punching her in the face during an altercation between the two. He was stood down indefinitely by the NRL on May 23, falling under the game's no-fault stand-down policy, which excludes him from playing until his court case is finalised. The league's decision comes after the player recently signed a two-year extension at Penrith Panthers worth close to $1.5 million. Despite their decision, the NRL has said it \"should in no way be interpreted as a view on the innocence or guilt\" of May. A statement issued by the club following May's arrest said they \"will continue to provide support to all parties involved and will not make any further comment at this time\". 1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732) Lifeline 13 11 14 Advertisement Sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.

        "content": "There's a joke among a group of rural nurses: staff shortages would be solved instantly if every hospital had a creche. or signup to continue reading It's a quip that's hit home for Victorian nurse and diabetes educator Leah-Ann Stephenson, who cannot return to work because there are no childcare spots for her 11-month-old son. \"Somebody needs to pick up that business model, especially for nurses, because the demographic is mostly women,\" Ms Stephenson told AAP. \"If they can't get their kids into childcare, they can't get back to work.\" Ms Stephenson was four months pregnant when she joined waiting lists at five centres in Swan Hill, but she has been told her son may not get a spot before he's two. Her employer has been understanding in offering casual shifts and extending her maternity leave by a year, she said. But being unable to return to work is an ongoing frustration. \"In this day and age when women are supposed to be able to do it all, it's certainly not easy.\" It's particularly difficult for families in country towns across Australia, which are often classified as \"childcare deserts\". The term refers to areas where there are three or more children for every childcare place, according to landmark research by Victoria University's Mitchell Institute. A group of more than 50 rural and regional organisations, including Royal Far West, the National Farmers' Federation and the Regional Australia Institute, will on Tuesday call for an urgent fix. The Access for Every Child Coalition, led by advocacy group The Parenthood, will gather at Parliament House in Canberra to push for federal policy changes to address early education inequity. The Parenthood's campaign director Maddy Butler said lack of childcare doesn't just affect families. \"This means local businesses and essential services can't find workers. This is killing towns,\" Ms Butler said. \"Think of a nurse in a rural town who can't go back to work for as many days as she wants, or at all, because there's no childcare available. \"This not only affects her family's income but also the healthcare services that are critical for the community.\" The group is asking for six urgent actions to address shortages, including subsidies for regional early education providers that are not tied to enrolment numbers. It is also calling for the federal government to manage the sector with its state, territory and local counterparts to achieve universal access, as well as incentivising rural childcare workers. While some of those strategies may take time to develop, the coalition is urging the government to provide short-term solutions such as funding for mobile early learning centres. Measures in the federal budget, including a commitment to raise wages for childcare workers, were welcome, but did not go far enough, Ms Butler said. \"It's high time to recognise the unique needs of these communities and act.\" Advertisement Sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.

        "content": "There's a joke among a group of rural nurses: staff shortages would be solved instantly if every hospital had a creche. $ 0 / (min cost $ 0 ) Login or signup to continue reading It's a quip that's hit home for Victorian nurse and diabetes educator Leah-Ann Stephenson, who cannot return to work because there are no childcare spots for her 11-month-old son. \"Somebody needs to pick up that business model, especially for nurses, because the demographic is mostly women,\" Ms Stephenson told AAP. \"If they can't get their kids into childcare, they can't get back to work.\" Ms Stephenson was four months pregnant when she joined waiting lists at five centres in Swan Hill, but she has been told her son may not get a spot before he's two. Her employer has been understanding in offering casual shifts and extending her maternity leave by a year, she said. But being unable to return to work is an ongoing frustration. \"In this day and age when women are supposed to be able to do it all, it's certainly not easy.\" It's particularly difficult for families in country towns across Australia, which are often classified as \"childcare deserts\". The term refers to areas where there are three or more children for every childcare place, according to landmark research by Victoria University's Mitchell Institute. A group of more than 50 rural and regional organisations, including Royal Far West, the National Farmers' Federation and the Regional Australia Institute, will on Tuesday call for an urgent fix. The Access for Every Child Coalition, led by advocacy group The Parenthood, will gather at Parliament House in Canberra to push for federal policy changes to address early education inequity. The Parenthood's campaign director Maddy Butler said lack of childcare doesn't just affect families. \"This means local businesses and essential services can't find workers. This is killing towns,\" Ms Butler said. \"Think of a nurse in a rural town who can't go back to work for as many days as she wants, or at all, because there's no childcare available. \"This not only affects her family's income but also the healthcare services that are critical for the community.\" The group is asking for six urgent actions to address shortages, including subsidies for regional early education providers that are not tied to enrolment numbers. It is also calling for the federal government to manage the sector with its state, territory and local counterparts to achieve universal access, as well as incentivising rural childcare workers. While some of those strategies may take time to develop, the coalition is urging the government to provide short-term solutions such as funding for mobile early learning centres. Measures in the federal budget, including a commitment to raise wages for childcare workers, were welcome, but did not go far enough, Ms Butler said. \"It's high time to recognise the unique needs of these communities and act.\" Australian Associated Press",

        "content": "GATINEAU — The Competition Bureau has launched the consultation process for Canadians as it prepares to launch a market study of competition in domestic air passenger services in Canada. “The airline industry is important to Canadians and the Canadian economy. Since the Canadian population is spread out over vast distances, other modes of transportation may not be feasible replacements for air travel. More competition in the industry will mean lower prices, better services, and improved productivity,” said Matthew Boswell, Commissioner of Competition. News of the bureau’s upcoming study first hit earlier this month. A statement from the Competition Bureau notes that recent events have raised questions about the state of competition in the industry ... The bureau says the market study will allow it to better understand what is driving these issues, and to make recommendations to all levels of government to improve competition in the airline industry. The study will examine how to make it easier for new businesses to compete and easier for consumers to make informed choices. For public feedback, interested parties can submit their comments by June 17 through a feedback form or by emailing airlinemarketstudy-etudemarcheaerien@cb-bc.gc.ca . Following the consultation, the bureau will publish its final terms of reference and officially launch the market study. The final terms of reference will include details on how to provide submissions to the market study.",

        "content": "Linda MacMullen has been battling with a rare autoimmune disease called myasthenia gravis (MG) for over two decades. This chronic disorder causes weakness in the skeletal muscles, which are responsible for a wide range of body movements and breathing. Myasthenia gravis can affect various facial muscles, altering a person’s ability to smile, chew, swallow, and control their eye movements. One of the most common symptoms experienced by people diagnosed with the disorder is becoming exhausted and feeling weaker following brief periods of physical activity or after performing everyday tasks. “Symptoms can be very mild where it just affects your eyes or it could be very severe where you end up in the hospital on a ventilator,” explained MacMullen. However, perhaps the most debilitating symptom of MG, according to MacMullen, is one that is not visible. “When you get diagnosed, the biggest thing is that you feel so alone,” said MacMullen. “When I was diagnosed, I’d never heard of my myasthenia and I was a nurse. (My) biggest (goal now) is breaking this isolation (and helping others.)” Though this disease has no cure to date, the prospect of a new drug called Vyvgart, approved by Health Canada in late 2023, gives hope to MacMullen. “One of my friends in Ontario is getting that treatment right now so we’re all waiting to see how well it works with her,” she said. “Anything that can give people a better quality of life and allow them to do the things that give them pleasure (I’m all for it.)” In the meantime, as June approaches, marking Myasthenia Gravis Awareness Month, MacMullen invites residents of the Comox Valley and beyond to a walk she organizes annually. “(I’m doing this walk) mainly to raise awareness (and) funds,” said MacMullen. “The more awareness we create, the more people know about it. Right now, my whole focus is on improving (people’s) quality of life.” MacMullen explained that any donations can go a long way. “(With more funding we) would offer more support to patients and caregivers dealing with myasthenia gravis. It would also allow me to organize more events like online support groups where we have guest speakers and get more information about new upcoming treatments.” This year’s event will be held at Courtenay’s Woodcote Park and is scheduled for June 23, starting at 10 a.m. Hot dogs and water will be offered at the end of the walk.

        "description": "Squeeze Benz has made it his mission to antagonize police across New York and New Jersey in recent months, resulting in his arrest.The post Who Is Squeeze Benz? NYC’s Infamous Street Racer Who Was Arrested appeared first on HotNewHipHop.",
        "content": "If you're active on social media at all, you may have already come across the fast-driving, cop-taunting daredevil by the username of Squeeze Benz. Squeeze Benz has been making street racing videos for some time now, often evading police after speeding through New York City. Investigators recently arrested Squeeze Benz after linking his vehicle registration to his Instagram handle, seemingly ending his reign over the streets despite his usual success at avoiding capture. Benz has managed to avoid investigators up to this point by employing some slick street maneuvering and stripping the license plates from his vehicles while performing stunts on the road. With over 1 million followers on social media, Squeeze Benz has amassed major notoriety, with plenty of onlookers curious to learn more about the internet figure following his arrest. Now that his identity has been revealed, let's look into everything we know regarding the famous viral street racer, and unpack the truth behind his hidden identity. The most shocking element of Squeeze Benz's identity reveal was his age. Following his arrest, many discovered the young street takeover champion is a Flushing, Queens native named Antonio Ginestri. Surprisingly, Ginestri is only 19 years old, which means he likely only had his license briefly before embarking upon this bizarre undertaking. The teenage thrill seeker frequently reached top speeds of 130 miles per hour in his viral videos and always wore a mask to conceal his identity. Often, a young accomplice would appear in the seat next to him as he would taunt cops and speed away in his lineup of luxury vehicles. Following his arrest, Deputy Commissioner of NYPD Operations Kaz Daughtry wrote on social media “One of the most prolific street racers in NYC can no longer treat the Big Apple like the Indy 500.\" While Benz's exploits were certainly dangerous to the general public, it is quite impressive that he was able to pull off at a young age. Perhaps this arrest will serve as an important life lesson for Ginestri. With any luck, he may continue driving in a competitive capacity, confined to properly zoned race tracks and other legal areas. As previously stated, Squeeze Benz had maintained a long and documented track record of duping local cops. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that Squeeze Benz required the combined efforts of multiple departments to make the arrest. Apparently, the investigation began after Ginestri's latest exploit, which saw him doing donuts around police vehicles on April 11. While he was ultimately able to escape police pursuit with a high-speed departure and some quick maneuvering, the police were able to trace his car back to the Squeeze Benz account. From there, it was only a matter of time before the authorities connected the dots. The NYPD Auto Crimes division then collaborated with the Newark Police force in order to tie Ginestri back to the Squeeze Benz alias, following an unrelated incident that saw Ginestri allegedly assaulting another young man inside an Astoria deli. Police charged Ginestri with reckless driving, eluding police, theft, conspiracy, and employing a juvenile in the commission of a crime after identifying him as . That last charge likely relates to Squeeze Benz's penchant for bringing friends along to ride shotgun. The young men are often seen clutching at their passenger seat as Benz skids away from the police at top speeds. Despite his young age, this most recent run-in with the police is somehow not Squeeze Benz's first-ever arrest. In fact, the 19-year-old had just pleaded guilty to an unrelated crime in March, only weeks before the investigation into the Squeeze Benz account began. The March arrest saw Ginestri plead guilty to possessing a stolen motorcycle. This guilty plea carried with it a $3,000 fine. At this time, lawyers for the young man have not released an official statement on his behalf, though folks have been going wild over Squeeze Benz on social media circles across the world. Not much is truly known about the street racer, though has made him something of a local celebrity, increasing his follower count with each passing day. [ ]",

        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that a deadly strike that hit a displacement camp in Gaza's Rafah was a \"tragic accident\" which his government was investigating. \"In Rafah, we evacuated a million uninvolved residents and, despite our best efforts, a tragic accident happened yesterday,\" Netanyahu told parliament. He added that \"we are investigating the case and will draw the conclusions\" after Gaza's health ministry reported 45 dead as the strike late Sunday sparked a fire that tore through a tent city for displaced Gazans. The ministry in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip also said that 249 people were wounded. Israel faced a wave of international condemnation on Monday over the Rafah strike, including from across the region as well from the European Union, France and the United Nations. The Israeli military said it had launched a probe into the strike which it said was carried out based on \"precise intelligence information\" about two Hamas militants who it said were killed. It also said \"the strike did not occur in the humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi, to which the IDF (army) has encouraged civilians to evacuate\" since the ground operation began in Rafah. Netanyahu struck a defiant tone in his Knesset address while being heckled by relatives of hostages held in Gaza, and vowed to keep up the battle to destroy Hamas. \"There is no substitute for absolute victory\" in Gaza, he told the chamber. Netanyahu denounced pressure, both internal and external, that he said his government has faced since the war in Gaza began. \"They pressured us then,\" said Netanyahu, before listing calls to refrain from military operations which Israel carried out anyway. \"Don't enter Gaza. We entered! Do not enter Shifa! We entered! Do not enter Khan Yunis! We entered! Do not enter Rafah! We entered!\" he said. \"I don't give up and I won't give up! I stand up to pressures from home and abroad.",

        "content": "The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) reported a smooth start to the casting of special votes on Monday, despite some glitches resulting in voting stations opening late in parts of the country. The first official day of voting inside the country was marred by isolated protests - in the Eastern Cape and parts of Gauteng - and there were reports of voting stations failing to open, but the IEC indicated that only 0.1% of those casting their votes experienced problems doing so. The IEC's deputy chief electoral commissioner, Masego Sheburi, said that, from 14:00 on Monday, around 201 794 people visited voting stations to cast special votes across the country. A total of 1 668 076 people had applied for special votes. Of these, 624 593 citizens will be visited by 62 000 officials over the next two days. \"Reports of difficulties were insignificant... about 0.1% reported challenges compared to those [stations] that opened and were run smoothly,\" he said. READ | Special votes day 1: Slow queues, a sense of obligation, and a lamp post Rickroll He said a record number of voters had applied for special votes this time around, with more than 1.6 million voters applying for special votes this year compared to the 774 000 who applied in 2019. \"The Electoral Commission is happy with the turnout and urges South Africans to continue to go out in their numbers to vote on 29 May 2024. \"Owing to the good preparations, the commission was able to open the majority of voting stations in the Eastern Cape, in the face of protests which had nothing to do with elections.\" He told journalists that 107 of the 435 voting stations meant to open remained closed due to \"external factors\". The IEC is pushing to ensure that all voting stations open on Tuesday. Some voting stations failed to open due to a lack of stationary - ballot papers and envelopes. Special votes are cast using a two-envelope system. The voter places their ballots into an envelope in the ballot box, which is then inserted into a second envelope, with the name and identity number of the individual, before being placed in the ballot box. This ensures that all votes cast are accounted for when they are counted. Special votes are counted along with the bulk votes, which are cast on 29 May. Special votes continue on Tuesday, ahead of the election day for the rest of the country on Wednesday, with polls opening at 07:00.",

        "content": "Citrusy soft drink is making another attempt to catch on in Japan . Within the Japanese beverage world, Mello Yello is sort of a cryptid. It’s a drink not a lot of people haven’t heard of, and even among those who have, even fewer have seen it for themselves. It first came to Japan in the 1980s, and while it’s been offered on and off since, it’s never stuck around for very long and has been completely absent from the Japanese market since 2021. But right now Japan has an opportunity to get acquainted with the citrusy soda, as convenience store chain Lawson has brought Mello Yello back to Japan . For its part, Lawson seems fully aware that Mello Yello doesn’t have the highest level of name-recognition within Japan, with its above announcement image reading “That Mello Yello drink has returned!? Not really sure what it is, but try it!” The accompanying press release recalls that when Mello Yello was first brought to Japan, its official slogan was “A taste that’s very difficult to describe in words,” and admits that many of the chain’s present-day customers may react to its return with something along the lines of “It first came out here in the 1980s? I wasn’t even born then, so I don’t know what this stuff is.” It is a bit of an uphill marketing battle, seeing as how even in its home country of the United States, Mello Yello is seen by many as an imitation of Mountain Dew, a drink itself which hasn’t really caught on in Japan ( the Sanrio Mountain Dew public bath notwithstanding ). Still, Mello Yello isn’t without its fans in Japan, finishing in first place in 2006 in a poll by Internet portal Goo Ranking for “discontinued soft drinks we want to drink again.” All the same, the brand managers apparently realize that Mello Yello piggybacking on some more famous brands will probably help its sales potential, and so it’s officially being called Coca-Cola Fanta Citrus Mello Yello . Coca-Cola Fanta Citrus Mello Yello, priced at 162 yen (US$1.05) is on sale now exclusively at Lawson stores. While the chain hasn’t explicitly said anything about it being a limited-time release, given the highly competitive nature of the soft drink scene in Japan, it’s probably best to go grab a few bottles sooner rather than later.

        "description": "The sensitive updates to this Victorian home have refreshed its look without compromising on heritage charm",
        "content": "The renovation of this family home in Brookline, MA, was all about finding the right balance. The 1905-built Victorian home already had plenty of period charm – all part of the original – but its new owners wanted to add in a few key user-friendly details that you'd be more likely to find in a newly built home. How to update a heritage property without sacrificing its character and meaningful details: that was the challenge for this renovation. To ensure they came up with the right solution the owners enlisted the help of . 'This project spoke to our design hearts with the encouragement to create a masterful blend and bring something fresh to the table,' says principal Vani Sayeed, who describes how she gave the historic home a new lease of life, all the while being mindful of its unique character. 'The goal was to first update the interior architecture by moving a few walls, restoring some of the original architectural details and adding important design elements to elevate and make all spaces not only functional but beautiful and inviting,' says designer Vani Sayeed. 'The client wanted an updated space that had the charm and architectural details of a bygone era but with all the bells and whistles and comforts of a modern home.' The renovation kept the basic layout of a classic Victorian home as the homeowner was drawn to more private areas to entertain, such as a formal dining room, separate kitchen and this cozy parlor . The Roman shades fabric is Sacho Clouds from TM Interiors, with a coffee table from Restoration Hardware, and wall sconces from Urban Electric. The artworks are from the owners' existing Collection, with some from Vani Sayeed. 'This project was a collaboration between client and designer based on a mutual love of classic New England architecture, the ethereal beauty of the California coastline and the grand Rocky Mountains of Colorado,' explains Vani Sayeed. 'With this in mind as the inspiration we aspired to create spaces that reflected the calming rejuvenating quality found in nature.' This comfortable space includes a custom rug from Vani Sayeed's Global Chic Collection, with the designer selecting the perfect for the living room. Vani Sayeed Studios is an award-winning multi-discipline design firm. Vani Sayeed is the firm’s principal; well known for her globally inspired and beautifully layered spaces. She was awarded Interior Designer of the Year 2023 by IFDA, New England. Her inspiration comes from a worldly well-travelled and creative perspective. She is informed by a diverse sensibility of design, art and architecture. The ethos of the studio is to honor classical traditions, while embracing novelty and innovation. While the furnishings and furniture are contemporary, the bones of the house clearly reference the property's Victorian origins. Details such as the striking bay windows and smart architectural moldings truly ground the home and ensure it keeps its character, even though it has been updated to make for a more comfortable family life. Tucked into an original alcove, this stylish enhances and makes good use of the Victorian architecture. 'The kitchen was completely gutted down to studs and redesigned to create a larger footprint, along with new windows, cabinets and state-of-the-art appliances,' says Vani. are light and bright with white cabinetry and a dark blue custom-built island providing a good contrast with the white units. The cabinets are from Signature, the countertops are white quartzite in a leather finish and the island is in the dramatic quartzite explosion blue leathered 2.5” mitered edge were at the heart of Vani's redesigned kitchen, with the trio of contemporary pendant lights above the counter becoming a new focal point. Coming up with the right for the redesigned kitchen took some thinking. Vani knew there should be a second element of contrast with the white cabinetry, besides the dark marble-topped island, and the custom stainless steel hood in a more traditional style proved to be the perfect choice, inspired by a Henry Moore sculpture, says Vani. 'These old houses are full of surprises,' says Vani, 'but the one thing that actually turned into a major plus is the breakfast nook in the kitchen. It was carved out of a found space during our demolition of the old kitchen. Instead of boarding it back up, we realigned some of the structure and utilized this valuable real estate by incorporating it into a spot for breakfast with hidden LED lighting.' Anyone looking for will surely be inspired by this treatment. 'We covered the niche in a cool blue crocodile pattern wall covering from Elitis, adding stainless steel open shelves and gorgeous oak details,' adds Vani. Although the owner was keen to embrace separate and formal , this space sits at the heart of the home, with enlarged doorways through to the kitchen and foyer. The central position adds to the impression that you are in an intimate, cozy space – the perfect setting for good mealtime conversations. 'We love this dining room with walls covered in Elitis Luminescent Isis. The gold hammered effect of the wall covering makes your skin glow!' says designer Vani. Furniture includes a custom-designed dining table with a steel base and mahogany top, flanked by chairs from Dowel Furniture. The jewel pieces are the host and hostess chairs by Jamie Stern in two different fabrics. The backs are a bold Schumacher Tabriz, the inside fabric is Perennials' Classy design. The area rug is the Summer Day Walk, from Vani Sayeed's Global Chic Collection, the chandelier is from Urban Electric. Making a big impact as you walk in the front door is the imposing but welcoming . 'The two-level foyer has beautiful architectural woodwork that has been restored to its original beauty. The lighting is Urban Electric, the fireplace has been updated with a gas insert and beautiful Fossil Black Quartzite surround,' says Vani. took shape around a dramatic wool runner from Merida Rugs, which provides a great foundation to the bold art on the wall. On the hallway's lower level, this corner creates an appealing display moment with a dark wood table and bench grounding a fine landscape painting and a collection of treasured ceramics. Having the luxury of space and quirky alcoves to create interesting displays like this is something that older character homes do well. The window treatments in this calm are made in Clodagh, a simple fabric from Perennials, the bed is Room & Board flanked on either side by wall sconces from Estiluz, with a beautiful nude painting from the owner's collection. The primary bathroom is spacious with a shower and separate soaking tub. include shower walls covered in a green marble mosaic and the floor is a 12“x24“ faux marble porcelain tile from Porcelanosa. The roll-top bath and dark wood vanity reference the home's original 19th-century style. bring a playful twist to the guest facilities. The quirky Buggie Atomic 29 wallcovering by Abnormals Anonymous lends a fun element to the walls, with custom-made copper plumbing adding the luxurious finishing touches. It's the thoughtful details in this historic home's redesign that so successfully bridge the gap between period charm and modern-day comforts. New items are designed to blend with original features, bringing a fresh perspective and new life to this old home. Interior design: Photography:",

        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that a deadly strike that hit a displacement camp in Gaza's Rafah was a \"tragic accident\" which his government was investigating. \"In Rafah, we evacuated a million uninvolved residents and, despite our best efforts, a tragic accident happened yesterday,\" Netanyahu told parliament. He added that \"we are investigating the case and will draw the conclusions\" after Gaza's health ministry reported 45 dead as the strike late Sunday sparked a fire that tore through a tent city for displaced Gazans. The ministry in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip also said that 249 people were wounded. Israel faced a wave of international condemnation on Monday over the Rafah strike, including from across the region as well from the European Union, France and the United Nations. The Israeli military said it had launched a probe into the strike which it said was carried out based on \"precise intelligence information\" about two Hamas militants who it said were killed. It also said \"the strike did not occur in the humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi, to which the IDF (army) has encouraged civilians to evacuate\" since the ground operation began in Rafah. Netanyahu struck a defiant tone in his Knesset address while being heckled by relatives of hostages held in Gaza, and vowed to keep up the battle to destroy Hamas. \"There is no substitute for absolute victory\" in Gaza, he told the chamber. Netanyahu denounced pressure, both internal and external, that he said his government has faced since the war in Gaza began. \"They pressured us then,\" said Netanyahu, before listing calls to refrain from military operations which Israel carried out anyway. \"Don't enter Gaza. We entered! Do not enter Shifa! We entered! Do not enter Khan Yunis! We entered! Do not enter Rafah! We entered!\" he said. \"I don't give up and I won't give up! I stand up to pressures from home and abroad.\" The Gaza war broke out after the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,050 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry. To remove this article -",

        "content": "RAFA NADAL was given a hero’s send-off in Paris as he waved goodbye to the French Open for possibly the final time. Grand Slam champions Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek were present on Court Philippe-Chatrier to witness the abdication of the King of Clay. This was the hottest ticket in town as Nadal – winner of a record 14 French Opens since 2005 – bid farewell to the place where he is adored the most. Alex Zverev , the No 4 seed, was simply too strong and wily and ended up succeeding in straight sets 6-3 7-6 6-3 over more than three hours. Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, went down on his shield like a true warrior and did not disgrace himself – he was just beaten by the better man on his special occasion. At times, we did see glimpses of the racquet-wielding matador at his best. But it was too infrequent to knock out the German, who prevailed two years after their last encounter in the semi-finals when he tore ankle ligaments in a horror fall. For what we assume is the last time on these grounds, Nadal shook hands with his opponent at the net and then the umpire before putting away his racquets and zipping up his bag. The noise was deafening when he arrived on court holding the hand of a ball kid under a closed roof due to the rain. And it was equally as ear-splitting when he departed, the climax to a record-breaking two-decade spell on Parisian clay. CASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS Technically this is not his final appearance on this red surface as he wants to return for the Paris Olympics in late July and early August with the intention of playing at least men’s doubles with Alcaraz. However, Nadal is unlikely to play at Wimbledon because the quick transition of clay-grass-clay might ruin his chances of a third Olympic medal in the French capital. But he even teased he might return for the 2025 French Open, saying that he would not commit 100% to this being his swansong event. He said: \"I don’t know if it is the last time I am here in front of you, honestly. \"I’m not 100%. If it is the last time, I enjoyed it. The crowd have been amazing during the whole two weeks of preparation.\" There was no specially-arranged farewell presentation for the 22-time major winner on his request. Yet the sight of so many active stars, including his biggest rivals, in the stands was, in a way, its own tribute. The whole Nadal clan were in attendance, too, with a debut appearance for son Rafael Jr, who was born in October 2022. The travelling party also included grey-haired uncle Miguel, 57, whose penalty for Spain was saved by England goalkeeper David Seaman in the quarter-final shootout of Euro 96 at Wembley. Manchester City star Rodri, fresh from the FA Cup final defeat , had managed to nab a ticket to watch his fellow compatriot and joined in with the morale-boosting chants of Rafa. This was Nadal’s fourth defeat in 116 matches here and the first time he has exited from the first round as he sent a forehand wide and long. His Roland Garros record is one of the most astonishing ever witnessed in professional sport and it is unlikely his dominance will be replicated. There is already a statue of him in full flow next to the main arena and it will act as a reminder for future generations just how exceptional he was on this surface. Nadal continued: \"Today the feeling I have is difficult to describe in words. \"For me, it’s special to feel the love of the people in the place I love the most. \"I have been going through a tough two years in terms of injuries. I went through all this process with the dream to be here at Roland Garros. \"The first round hasn’t been the ideal one. I have to say I needed something else, I was competitive, I had my chances but it was not enough against a great player. \"It’s difficult to say what happens in the future. It’s a big percentage that I will not be back here. I cannot say 100%. I am having fun, the body is feeling better than two months ago. \"Maybe in two months I say, it’s enough. I cannot give anything else. I don’t feel it yet. \"I have goals in front of me. I hope to be back for the Olympics. That motivates me. I hope to be well prepared. \"It has been a very beautiful process, all the memories, every single year were different, but not less special. Unforgettable feelings. I hope to see you again but I don’t know.\"",

        "content": "RAFA NADAL was given a hero’s send-off in Paris as he waved goodbye to the French Open for possibly the final time. Grand Slam champions Novak Djokovic , Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek were present on Court Philippe-Chatrier to witness the abdication of the King of Clay. This was the hottest ticket in town as Nadal – winner of a record 14 French Opens since 2005 – bid farewell to the place where he is adored the most. Alex Zverev , the No 4 seed, was simply too strong and wily and ended up succeeding in straight sets 6-3 7-6 6-3 over more than three hours. Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, went down on his shield like a true warrior and did not disgrace himself – he was just beaten by the better man on his special occasion. At times, we did see glimpses of the racquet-wielding matador at his best. But it was too infrequent to knock out the German, who prevailed two years after their last encounter in the semi-finals when he tore ankle ligaments in a horror fall. For what we assume is the last time on these grounds, Nadal shook hands with his opponent at the net and then the umpire before putting away his racquets and zipping up his bag. The noise was deafening when he arrived on court holding the hand of a ball kid under a closed roof due to the rain. And it was equally as ear-splitting when he departed, the climax to a record-breaking two-decade spell on Parisian clay. CASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS Technically this is not his final appearance on this red surface as he wants to return for the Paris Olympics in late July and early August with the intention of playing at least men’s doubles with Alcaraz. However, Nadal is unlikely to play at Wimbledon because the quick transition of clay-grass-clay might ruin his chances of a third Olympic medal in the French capital. But he even teased he might return for the 2025 French Open, saying that he would not commit 100% to this being his swansong event. He said: \"I don’t know if it is the last time I am here in front of you, honestly. \"I’m not 100%. If it is the last time, I enjoyed it. The crowd have been amazing during the whole two weeks of preparation.\" There was no specially-arranged farewell presentation for the 22-time major winner on his request. Yet the sight of so many active stars, including his biggest rivals, in the stands was, in a way, its own tribute. The whole Nadal clan were in attendance, too, with a debut appearance for son Rafael Jr, who was born in October 2022. The travelling party also included grey-haired uncle Miguel, 57, whose penalty for Spain was saved by England goalkeeper David Seaman in the quarter-final shootout of Euro 96 at Wembley. Manchester City star Rodri, fresh from the FA Cup final defeat , had managed to nab a ticket to watch his fellow compatriot and joined in with the morale-boosting chants of Rafa. This was Nadal’s fourth defeat in 116 matches here and the first time he has exited from the first round as he sent a forehand wide and long. His Roland Garros record is one of the most astonishing ever witnessed in professional sport and it is unlikely his dominance will be replicated. There is already a statue of him in full flow next to the main arena and it will act as a reminder for future generations just how exceptional he was on this surface. Nadal continued: \"Today the feeling I have is difficult to describe in words. \"For me, it’s special to feel the love of the people in the place I love the most. \"I have been going through a tough two years in terms of injuries. I went through all this process with the dream to be here at Roland Garros. \"The first round hasn’t been the ideal one. I have to say I needed something else, I was competitive, I had my chances but it was not enough against a great player. \"It’s difficult to say what happens in the future. It’s a big percentage that I will not be back here. I cannot say 100%. I am having fun, the body is feeling better than two months ago. \"Maybe in two months I say, it’s enough. I cannot give anything else. I don’t feel it yet. \"I have goals in front of me. I hope to be back for the Olympics. That motivates me. I hope to be well prepared. \"It has been a very beautiful process, all the memories, every single year were different, but not less special. Unforgettable feelings. I hope to see you again but I don’t know.\"",

        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread by Hebrew University of Jerusalem A new study has shown an advance in the treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections in animals. The research, focusing on a 5-year-old Siamese cat Squeaks with a multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection post-arthrodesis surgery, marks the first published documented application of personalized phage therapy in veterinary medicine. The research paper titled \"Successful phage-antibiotic therapy of P. aeruginosa implant-associated infection in a Siamese cat\" is published in Veterinary Quarterly . The study was led by Prof. Ronen Hazan and his team, from the Faculty of Dental Medicine at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in collaboration with the team of Vet Holim, JVMV–Veterinary medical center in Kiryat -Anavim, Israel. Squeaks, initially treated at the JVMV for injuries sustained from a high-rise fall, developed a severe infection in the right hind leg following multiple surgeries. This infection persisted despite various antibiotic treatments over four months. Facing a potential implant-replacement surgery, the team turned to the new treatment which involved a meticulously designed combination of a specific anti-P. aeruginosa phage, a virus that kills bacteria, applied topically to the surgical wound and ceftazidime administered intramuscularly. The owners of the cat, after a short demonstration, provided most of the treatment doses of phages and antibiotics at their home. The integration of phage therapy with antibiotics was aimed at targeting the pathogen effectively and directly at the site of infection, leveraging the phage's ability to be applied topically, which simplifies administration and maximizes its concentration at the infection site. This approach allowed the surgical wound, which had remained open for five months, to fully heal after fourteen weeks of treatment. The successful outcome of this case underscores the critical need for novel therapeutics like phage therapy to address the growing concern of antibiotic-resistant infections, which affect up to 8.5% of surgical sites following orthopedic surgeries in companion animals. These infections not only pose significant health risks to the animals but also increase the morbidity, mortality, and costs associated with these procedures. Recent studies suggest that phage therapy, already showing high success rates in human medicine for treating orthopedic infections and chronically infected wounds, can offer a promising solution for similar issues in veterinary practice. Moreover, the successful treatment of this cat by its owners at home highlights the practicality and efficacy of personalized phage therapy, which could be extended to treat other pets facing similar antimicrobial resistance challenges. Interestingly, contrary to common situations, this case was performed on an animal based on the team's insights from treating humans first. The positive reception from veterinarians and pet owners regarding phage therapy points to a growing awareness and acceptance of this treatment option. As the new treatment continues to be explored in veterinary settings, it not only improves the health and well-being of pets but also offers valuable data that contribute to the broader application of phage therapy in both animals and humans. This bridging of data can enhance treatment protocols and outcomes across a variety of bacterial infections, potentially changing the landscape of infection treatment in both veterinary and human medicine .

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The mistake only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas , with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel's military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from Israel's strongest supporters. The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images\" from the strike on Rafah \"are heartbreaking.\" It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. \"There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he wrote. The Foreign Office of Germany, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel for decades, said “the images of charred bodies, including children, from the airstrike in Rafah are unbearable.” “The exact circumstances must be clarified, and the investigation announced by the Israeli army must now come quickly,′ the ministry added. ”The civilian population must finally be better protected.” Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. The ICC only intervenes when it concludes that the state in question is unable or unwilling to properly prosecute such crimes. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "description": "A pair of new University of Alberta studies show how to make firefighters' clothing safer to wear, maintain and manufacture.",
        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread by Bev Betkowski, University of Alberta A pair of new University of Alberta studies show how to make firefighters' clothing safer to wear, maintain and manufacture. One study revealed that some fibers used in the protective gear break down when exposed to warm water, showing what can happen to the garments over time, during real-life firefighting scenarios and laundering. The other study analyzed the water used in the manufacture of fibers, identifying a handful of harmful dye compounds leaching from the fabrics that could weaken their protective qualities. \"The findings of both studies show vulnerabilities and potential ways to improve the materials currently being used in firefighters' clothing, and for maintenance,\" says Saiful Hoque, who conducted the work to earn a Ph.D. in textile and apparel science from the Faculty of Agricultural, Life & Environmental Sciences (ALES). Using accelerated aging treatments reflecting firefighting and laundering conditions, the first study , published in the Journal of Polymer Science , investigated the effects of heat and water on 15 different yarns in eight fabrics typically used to manufacture protective clothing . The fibers were immersed in both purified neutral pH and acidic water ranging from 40°C to 90°C for up to 1,200 hours at a time, then checked for physical, chemical and other types of deterioration. The results of the hydrothermal aging showed that fabric blends containing a particular type of fiber, called para-aramid/polybenzimidazole, or PBI, degraded in strength 68% more quickly when exposed to moisture, as opposed to similar fire-protective fabrics that didn't contain PBI. High-performance fiber blends containing PBI are typically used to make firefighters' outer jackets and trousers, due to the fiber's flexibility and ability to withstand extreme temperatures. But because PBI fibers are manufactured using sulfuric acid , traces of the chemical remain behind , shows a 2022 study led by Hoque. That residual sulfur increases a fabric's sensitivity to moisture, and could lead to premature degradation of protective garments, Hoque notes. The findings can help manufacturers of high-performance fibers and protective fabrics improve their processes, he suggests. \"PBI fibers are still good to use, but it's critical that producers develop ways to remove the residual sulfur from those fibers.\" Laundering of firefighting gear also needs to be changed up, by washing clothing with PBI fibers separately, Hoque advises. \"This prevents the risk of damage to neighboring fabrics that don't contain PBI fibers and wouldn't otherwise experience degradation in warm water .\" The same study also established, for the first time, that meta-aramid fibers, another type commonly used in protective clothing, showed \"remarkable resistance\" to heat and water stress, even when exposed to acidic water, Hoque says. For example, one fabric sample comprising 93% meta-aramid fibers lost only 4% of its tensile strength after being immersed in water for 1,200 hours at 90°C. That discovery fills a knowledge gap about the effectiveness of high-performance fibers to resist heat and water, allowing manufacturers \"more informed decisions in the selection and design of materials for more durable gear for firefighters,\" Hoque says. It also opens up possibilities for using meta-aramid fibers in other products frequently exposed to water, such as marine safety equipment, he adds. The overall exploration of the various yarns and their fibers provides a fuller understanding of their durability, Hoque says. \"We can now offer manufacturers suggestions for optimum fiber blends and fabric configurations that strike a better balance between long-term protection and comfort.\" In Hoque's second study , published in Fibers and Polymers , he developed a method of analyzing the water used in the experiments, which can be used by fabric manufacturers to make their production processes more environmentally sustainable, he says. The analysis identified three dye-related compounds known to pose some risk to the environment, \"particularly when they leach into water systems,\" he notes. Though not recommended for use, \"it's possible that some manufacturers still employ these compounds, so this information can help them prevent environmental pollution and adopt more sustainable practices.\" More information: Saiful Hoque et al, Hydrothermal aging behavior of high‐performance polymeric fibers: Mechanical performance at the yarn scale and chemical analysis, Journal of Polymer Science (2024).

David Zalubowski via Associated Press Bill Walton, an NBA Hall of Fame center who got his start at UCLA before winning NBA championships with the Portland Trail Blazers and the Boston Celtics, has died. Walton, 71, passed away after “a prolonged battle with cancer,” the NBA said in a statement Monday. “Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. “As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans.” Advertisement “But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver went on. “He was a regular presence at league events ― always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” “As a cherished member of the NBA family for 50 years, Bill will be deeply missed by all those who came to know and love him,” Silver said. “My heartfelt condolences to Bill’s wife, Lori; his sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris; and his many friends and colleagues.” This is a developing story.

        "description": "As we bid farewell to Ambassador Raveesh Kumar, the esteemed Indian representative in Finland, we reflect on his impactful tenure that began amidst the challenging backdrop of the global pandemic. Ambassador Kumar has been known for his active engagement during his time here, working to strengthen the bond between India and Finland. In this interview, we have the privilege of gaining insights from Ambassador Kumar as he shares his experiences, achievements, and perspectives garnered during his engaging four-year term in Finland.",
        "content": "You arrived in Finland just as the pandemic began. How was it to commence your mission during such challenging times? I arrived in Finland with my family in July 2020, in the middle of Covid pandemic. There were restrictions on movement, on meeting people. It felt like we were constantly navigating uncharted territory. Everything from remote work setups to health protocols kept changing, and it was a challenge to keep up. It was a test of adaptability and resilience like never before. I was fortunate to present my credentials to then President Niinistö and continued with our outreach initiatives. Even though it was a tough period, I think we all came out of it stronger in some way. It’s all behind us now, thankfully. You've been one of the most active ambassadors in Finland. Could you summarize your tenure here? Were you able to achieve your envisioned goals? As diplomats, we all are expected to do some groundwork before proceeding on our assignment. But then, implementation depends on the ground realities. And here, I was quite fortunate to be around when our relations are looking up and have acquired a certain momentum. The backdrop of the evolving geopolitical order played its part too. We have Finland as a member of NATO, part of Nordic-BALTIC framework and an influential voice in the EU. India is an important voice for the global south, the 5th largest and fastest growing economy and a country shaping the global narrative. We have a far larger global footprint and are members of several multilateral organisations like I2U2, BRICS, SCO, and recently launched India-Middle East-Europe initiative, Global Biofuel Alliance, ISA, etc. So, despite our own preoccupations, it goes to the credit of both countries that our relations have acquired substance and character. I had twin broad objectives in mind when I arrived here – present the new India with a rising geopolitical profile as a land of opportunities; and leverage the dynamism of the Indian community in Finland for strengthening our bilateral ties. The launch of DESI (Digitalisation, Education, Sustainability and Innovation) initiative, first-in person meeting between Prime Ministers, frequent Ministerial exchanges, opening of a new Finnish Consulate in Mumbai, record high trade figure of € 3 bn, growing investment by both sides, record participation at SLUSH and discussion on facilitating mobility are the highlights. We are working on creating a framework to cooperate in Quantum and in Sustainability. They all demonstrate the keen desire of both countries to engage in a concrete manner with each other in areas which are of interest and relevance to both countries as we celebrate 75 years of our diplomatic relations. On the Indian community, I am proud to represent a widely respected vibrant community. We managed to bring them together on a number of platforms like Friends of India and Finland (a platform representing 16 Indian community associations), India Business and Professionals Forum, connecting top Indian professionals and entrepreneurs and Finland India Network of Researchers and Academics. India Day, a festival celebrating friendship between both countries, is a proud product of the vibrant Indian community. You introduced the Open Doors initiative, allowing any Indian citizen to visit you twice a month without an appointment. How successful was this initiative, and what insights did you gain into the Indian community in Finland? The idea of Open House was to be accessible and transparent to the people. And to connect to the people who otherwise are outside the footprint of the Embassy. I managed to meet so many interesting people and learn from their own cumulative experiences in Finland. With the rapid growth of the Indian community in Finland, particularly in skilled IT sectors, how has this impacted the embassy's operations? Are there concerns about brain drain from India? The Indian community has emerged as a strong bridge connecting India and Finland. They are a well-placed and well-respected community in Finland. A community which contributes economically and socially to Finland. They are among the highest tax payers and well-integrated into the fabric of the Finnish society. We are leveraging their presence for a stronger bilateral connection between both countries. Were there any significant cultural adjustments or \"culture shocks\" you experienced during your four years in Finland? Well...’culture shock’ is too strong a word. Moving to Finland definitely involved some adjustments, especially related to weather, as with any international move. I found some aspects of Finnish culture different from what I was used to. I mean, where else can you enjoy sitting in a sauna at 90 degrees Celsius, and then jump into an ice-cold lake for fun? But once you absorb it with an open mind, it is not only a memorable experience, but also gives insights into the rich Finnish culture and tradition. As you prepare to lead the Indian mission in Prague and your successor takes over in Helsinki, what advice have you given regarding Finland, and what insights has your colleague offered about the Czech Republic? Well, I am in regular touch with my colleague and friend, Hemant, who is succeeding me as Ambassador and I take his place in Prague. We are discussing the upcoming agenda for both of us, as well as exchanging notes on the lighter side of things. On a lighter note, I am going to advise him to get a dog, to his your social circle in the neighbourhood! If you could provide feedback to the Finnish Minister of Foreign Affairs and your counterparts here, what would it entail? I had an excellent working relationship with the Foreign Ministry and other Ministries in Finland. I was quite delighted that there was the same level of enthusiasm to expand our partnership. I would say that we need to work together to elevate the relationship into a different orbit. Could you discuss the impact of your tenure on fostering collaborations, promoting cultural exchange, facilitating trade and investment, and engaging with the Indian diaspora in Finland? It may not be appropriate for me to judge my own tenure. It is for others to assess. I can, however, say that I was fortunate to be in Finland when there is plenty of goodwill on both sides. I strived to play my part in encouraging collaborations, promoting cultural exchange and facilitating trade and investment. Additionally, engaging with the Indian diaspora in Finland has been a rewarding experience, as we have worked together to build a supportive and vibrant community that strengthens the ties between our countries. While there is always more work to be done, I am satisfied with the strides we have made so far. Could you share any memorable experiences or anecdotes from your time as ambassador in Finland? There are many that come to my mind. My recent meeting with President Stubb and former Prime Minister Sanna Marin. My trips to 14 towns outside Helsinki, Yoga at midnight at Oonasvara in Rovaniemi, being among the many thousands at Savonlinna Opera Festival and the sheer thrill and energy of Jyvaskyla car rally. I would also highlight the whole experience of organising India Day 2023 with a dedicated and selfless team of volunteers. The warmth and enthusiasm of the community, combined with the participation of our Finnish friends, truly highlighted the beautiful blend of our cultures. India Day 2024 on 18 August at Meripuisto celebrating 75 years of diplomatic relations between India and Finland promises to be one big celebration. Alexis Kouros Helsinki Times",

        "content": "If we were glossing over it before now, the best time to sound the alarm was yesterday. Next best time? Today. As we celebrate our ‘future’ on this special ‘Children’s day’ in Nigeria, it’s important that we have conversations around their diet, health and wellness too. Today more than ever, there is an alarming increase in our children’s consumption of junk food like sugary drinks, sweets, and fast foods over nutritious, healthy and homemade meals. The dangerous impact of such shows in the rise of diet-related health conditions like childhood obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart and kidney diseases, and even behavioral issues to mention a few. What’s even worse are future projections by the experts, with the already alarming figures expected to more than double in the next 10-20 years. In Nigeria alone, the rate of childhood obesity has more than doubled in recent decades. This surge is largely attributed to the increasing consumption of junk food, which is high in sugar, unhealthy fats, and empty calories. Such poor dietary habits affect not just their health for today, but also sets the unhealthy stage for chronic illnesses later in life. Furthermore, considering the many other peculiar challenges in Nigeria outside of our locus of control (insecurity, inflation, etc), wisdom submits that we take absolute control over the diet and health of our children. Indeed, such unhealthy foods are pervasive due to factors like convenience especially in light of the increasingly busy lifestyle of parents, and then the aggressive and appealing marketing of these foods; however sacrificing the future health of our children over convenience today is not exactly a win, is it? Children are really the future, and if the future will be healthy, then it is time to SAVE our children and intentionally raise Wellness Champions. This however requires the collective effort of parents, educators, health care providers, and policymakers to model, teach and promote healthier eating habits and lifestyle choices. Thankfully, it’s not all doom and gloom. When people know better, they actually do better, which is why in celebration of our National Children’s Day, the documentary “Save Our Children” by Eziaha Bolaji-Olojo, which highlights the importance of diet, nutrition and healthy living premieres.

        "content": "POCATELLO — A bear escaped from the Ross Park Zoo in Pocatello in 1969 after police said vandals apparently cut a hole in its cage. The was featured in our weekly column, which looks back on what life was like during certain time periods in east Idaho history. EastIdahoNews.com readers wanted to know what happened to the bear, and this is what we found out. The 250-pound female was about three years old when she escaped May 4, 1969, according to the Idaho State Journal. The bear, which had recently after coming out of hibernation, took off between midnight on Saturday and 2 a.m. Sunday. “Freeing the animals not only is dangerous to the public but is cruel to the animals, which are not accustomed to surviving in the wild,” city zookeeper DeMar Day told the Journal. The Journal reported over a week after the bear went missing, on , that it had been seen in the lava rock area above the Cheyenne Crossing of the Union Pacific Railroad. “The bear drinks out of a watering trough in a nearby pasture,” city parks assistant Leonard Carlson stated. “The animal will be captured and returned to the zoo as soon as the state fish and game department has the necessary equipment here.” At that time, Carlson announced on top of vandals cutting a hole in the bear’s cage, “continued vandalism” was happening at Ross Park. The city council offered a $50 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone tampering with the pens and releasing zoo animals. Carlson also said anyone caught in either upper or lower levels of the park after 11 p.m. would be arrested. “The arrests will be made by Safeguard Systems Inc., the private security firm hired by the city to patrol the park,” the Journal mentioned. “The city council recently engaged Safeguard Systems, operated by Anson Garrett ... Garrett is equipped with specially trained police dogs.” Almost three months after the article on the planned attempt to capture the bear was written, the the bear had not been captured after all and was found dead. The Journal said the bear died of starvation. “The carcass was only skin and bones when found recently in lava rock about two blocks south of the park,” Day stated. He had predicted the bear couldn’t survive outside the zoo because there wasn’t enough fish or wild berries in the vicinity to provide food for the animal. “She was last seen alive about two weeks (after her escape) in the same area where she died,” the article states. Day believed the bear had been dead about a month when the animal was found. To remove this article -",

        "description": "If you've heard about the \"pro touring\" and \"restomod\" car-building styles, you might be wondering how they're different. Let's take a look.",
        "content": "Classic cars have an aura all of their own, with lines like the 1969 Ford Mustang having a signature style that sets them apart from even their sportiest, edgiest modern-day descendants. But while owning a classic big-block muscle car may seem like a great idea on paper, the reality may not be quite so rosy. Sure, it'll go fast in a straight line, but if you're used to modern cars you may find other aspects of the authentic vintage experience — overly-soft suspensions and sub-par braking systems, to name a couple — hard to live with. That's where restomods and pro-touring restorations come into the picture. Both approaches aim to retain the old-school aesthetic appeal of a vintage car while bringing the driving experience up to the 21st century with modern upgrades and tweaks. They're not for purists who want that \"blast from the past\" feel of a vintage car, warts and all, but they're a great way to immerse yourself in the vibe of the '60s or '70s without all of the sacrifices of the original model. If you want a modern experience with classic looks, then a restomod or pro-touring car is the way to go. But what do these terms mean, exactly, and how do you differentiate and choose between the two? Let's dive in. The term \"restomod\" is a portmanteau of \"restoration\" and \"modified,\" which explains the whole concept of a restomod remarkably well. They prioritize the restoration aspect, keeping a car close — or identical — to factory spec aesthetically while modifying it to improve the overall driving experience. However, restomods generally don't go too extreme with the modifications, retaining many of the qualities of the original car while bringing it up to modern-day standards. How much work gets put into a restomod will vary depending on the original car and what the builder's goals are. However, most restomods tend to feature updated handling and safety features — modern brakes, power steering, updated suspension — and creature comforts like new interiors and infotainment systems. New powertrains are also quite common, especially the (in)famous LS swap — one of the most popular engine swaps for a classic car using General Motors' LS V8. Another common modification is new wheels and tires, with larger diameter and width almost always the order of the day. The end goal of a restomod is to make a classic car more livable on a daily basis, bringing the reliability and drivability up to standards one would expect from a new, showroom-fresh car. It's a step beyond a traditional restoration, but isn't quite as extreme as a pro-touring car and its track-centric focus. Take a look at Singer's 911 restomods, such as the Octagon Commission , which has a traditional exterior married with a luxuriously updated interior and tuned engine. Pro touring cars are a step beyond conventional restomods. While they start from the same principles of modernizing and updating a classic car, builders of pro-touring models — especially muscle cars — often have the express goal of outpacing a modern, high-performance counterpart in a straight line and around corners. As the \"pro\" in the name might suggest, pro-touring cars are generally competition-focused — they emphasize autocross and road circuit performance, albeit without entirely compromising on daily driver comforts. This can involve a lot more work than a restomod as it requires modifications to most, if not all, aspects of the car to bring it up to a whole new level. Pro-touring cars can have all-new suspension setups with much lower ride heights and stiffer springs for better handling, paired with bigger wheels and sticky, high-performance tires. Engine and transmission upgrades are also par for the course, with some builds going so far as to use an entirely new chassis to take all that extra power and improve handling. Pro-touring cars can also feature modified bodies with new aerodynamics to further tweak the car's handling behavior — such as improving downforce for road courses. The term \"pro touring\" dates back to the early 1990s and a modified 1969 Camaro that competed in the 1993 One Lap of America. The Camaro, known as \"Tri-Tip,\" rocked a 400-cubic-inch small-block engine, Corvette ZR1 brakes, new 17-inch wheels, and weight-reducing parts such as a fiberglass hood. It set the template for — and kicked off — the whole pro-touring movement. [Image by Michel Curi via Wikimedia Commons | Cropped and scaled | CC BY 2.0 ] Both approaches focus on improving a classic car and go beyond simply restoring it to its old glory. In that regard, the two approaches are more similar than they are different. In fact, there is an argument to be made that \"restomod\" is a blanket term that covers pro touring as well. After all, both involve restoring a car before modifying it to suit whatever standards the owner wants — whether it's simply a classic car that can keep up with traffic and handle decently, or a track-focused monster capable of eating up Lamborghinis for lunch. Restomod and pro-touring builders also modify similar parts of a car, just to differing degrees. Modified suspensions? Check. Improved brakes and steering? Present on restomods and pro-touring cars. Even modified (or entirely new) engines and transmissions aren't solely the domain of pro-touring models, with restomods often opting for upgraded powertrains. Witness the Volvo P1800 Cyan GT Restomod and its 2-liter, 300-400 horsepower engine, which is a far cry from the 100 horsepower its stock 1.8-liter engine produces. If you boil the two terms down, they're more similar than they are different. But, as with so many things, it's the finer details that can help us separate the two. Pro-touring and restomod cars may have a similar basic philosophy, but the two differ greatly in their end results. Restomods are often more faithful to the base model — their mods are meant to modernize without losing the spirit of the original. For instance, Singer's Dynamics and Lightweighting Study 911 makes many changes to the original, with a stiffer body and various tweaks to the powertrain and transmission. Despite these tweaks, the restomod retains the original's handling characteristics. Notably, Top Gear tested the vehicle and found that the 911 had all the over- and understeer traits of the original, just in a more manageable form. It's still recognizably a Porsche 911 from the early 1990s generation , but with power and grip levels elevated closer to that of a modern performance car. Contrast that to a pro-touring build like Chris Smith's 1970 Camaro , which is an almost all-new car underneath the classic Chevrolet Camaro styling . Starting as an empty shell, Smith bolted on all-new front and rear suspension systems courtesy of Speedtech Performance, with Wilwood brakes all around. A 720-horsepower 427 LS7 engine sits underneath the hood, mated to a new sequential transmission. There's also a huge spoiler on the back, plus carbon fiber panels aplenty. The end result is a Camaro capable of navigating a small autocross circuit in a way that an original could only dream of. If you're in the market for a modernized classic, the decision between a restomod and pro-touring build primarily comes down to what you want out of your car. If you're interested in a daily driver and want your car to retain an old-school feel without the old-school headaches, then a more conservative restomod is likely the way to go. On the other hand, if you're after pure performance and competitive racing, a pro-touring build might just be what the doctor ordered. It's really just a matter of degrees, and how extreme of a car you want. Price comes into the picture, too, but the blurred line between pro-touring and restomods means it's hard to make a definitive statement about which of the two styles will be cheaper to build. Pro-touring cars can definitely cost a lot, and six-figure investments are not unheard-of — and probably quite common. But while restomods can be much cheaper, there are always exceptions. Some enthusiasts have put well over $100,000 into their restomods before selling them off for much less than what it cost them to build. That final point is perhaps a saving grace: If you're happy buying instead of building, you can often buy restomods and pro-tourer cars for surprisingly affordable prices — at least, compared to what the builders spent. We've seen pro-touring cars boasting $100,000 worth of parts selling for less than $80,000. That's really a steal, provided you can live with someone else's parts choices.",

        "description": "In MetroTalk: Is ‘more of the same’ or ‘worse’ the only choice we face?",
        "content": "In today’s MetroTalk , readers are wondering if the upcoming general election will finally bring some change or if we’ll just see more of the same. One reader wants us to remember the challenges the Tories had to deal with during their 14 years in power. Meanwhile, is UK sovereignty really under threat or is that just a soundbite to get your vote , should those with physical jobs be allowed their pensions early and who else should be held responsible for horrendous treatment of the Post Office sub-postmasters and mistresses? Share your thoughts on these topics and more in the comments. A reader says some realities of the tory government post-2010 were beyond their control (Credits: Bloomberg via Getty Images) What a selective memory Barry ( MetroTalk, Fri ) has when he idealises how it was when the Tories took over in 2010. It’s funny how he says ‘there were no front pages about people in boats’, while simultaneously praising ‘seamless trade and travel throughout Europe’. Well, firstly, Brexit happened (by a national vote, not by the Tories) and the fact there was seamless travel across Europe also meant there was unlimited immigration (something he fails to mention). Also, Covid hadn’t happened yet (which certainly wasn’t the fault of the Tory government ), or would Barry prefer that the government had let tens of thousands of workers lose their jobs without implementing furlough? Then he would really have cause to complain. It’s easy to pick and choose, but there are some harsh realities in between. Paul, London Let us know what you think...

It’s time for change. However, I don’t believe whoever leads the country after the general election of July 4 will be any different because parliament is run by the ‘uni-party’ and that means the same as usual – more tax, more war, more control. Roger, Wolverhampton What is Mark ( MetroTalk, Fri ) blithering on about when he says Reform UK is the only party that will ‘be able to protect UK sovereignty’? In what way is UK sovereignty under threat? It’s a soundbite the nutters in Reform hope you’ll swallow without thinking, sweetie. Aidan, Dartford ‘More of the same’ or ‘worse’ is the choice we face. Taxes? High or higher. Red tape and regulation? High or higher. Immigration? Very high or even higher still, if that’s possible. Defence? Weak or even weaker. Law and order? Weak or even weaker. Energy bills? High or higher. Net-zero targets? Pointless or obsessive. Leadership? Little or none. Our children’s future? Bleak or even bleaker. This feels not so much like a general election, as a wake for our nation. Otto Inglis, Crossgates Yes, Paula Vennells needs to take the blame for the horrendous treatment of the sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses while she was in charge of the Post Office. However, the criminal investigating officers who carried out the interviews are the real ones at fault. I speak as a recently retired detective and each of the people interviewed should have been given the disclosure that others had experienced problems with the Horizon computers and that multiple people were being investigated for the same thing. I hope these officers were also investigated by the Professional Standards Department. Gary, Essex I was born in 1962 and have worked all my working life. The government, whose members sit down most of the day, have moved the retirement age to 67. This is OK if you’re in good health and have an office or desk job. But when you’ve done a physical job for most of your working life and paid in full all national insurance and taxes etc, you should have the option to draw half of your pension at 65 and the rest when you get to 67. You never know what’s round the corner. Denis, via email In response to Alps ( MetroTalk, Thu ), I was also 100 per cent against it being made possible to use phones on the Tube. But after reading Alps’s letter about how not being glued to their devices allowed them to chat to strangers about pagan festivals, I’ve had a 100 per cent change of heart.

They benefit from the publicity, as does the event (more people attend). Plus, they often support the people putting their hard work into the show. It’s a win-win. Chas, London It’s high time an investigation was held into the fees charged by emergency locksmiths. I was charged £479 for ten minutes’ work, which involved drilling out the existing Yale-type lock and installing a new one.

        "description": "Generations of American families have grown up not knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones who died while serving their country in World War II and other conflicts. But a federal lab aims to answer those questions.",
        "content": "But a federal lab tucked away above the bowling alley at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha and a sister lab in Hawaii are steadily answering those lingering questions, aiming to offer 200 families per year the chance to honor their relatives with a proper burial. “They may not even have been alive when that service member was alive, but that story gets carried down through the generations,\" said Carrie Brown, a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab manager at Offutt. \"They may have seen on the mantle a picture of that person when they were little and not really understood or known who they were.” Memorial Day and the upcoming 80th anniversary of D-Day on June 6 are reminders of the urgency of Brown's work. The forensic anthropologists, medical examiners and historians who work together to identify lost soldiers are in a race against time as remains buried on battlefields around the globe deteriorate. But advances in DNA technology, combined with innovative techniques including comparing bones to chest X-rays taken by the military, mean the labs can identify more of the missing soldiers every year. Some 72,000 World War II soldiers remain unaccounted for, along with roughly 10,000 more from all the conflicts since. The experts believe about half of those are recoverable. The agency identified 59 servicemembers in 2013, when the Offutt lab first opened. That number has steadily risen — 159 service members last year, up from 134 in 2022 — and the labs have a goal of 200 identifications annually. The labs' work allowed Donna Kennedy to bury her cousin, Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, with full military honors this month in the same Lawson, Missouri, cemetery where his father and grandfather are buried. Patten died 74 years ago during the Korean War, but spent decades buried as an unknown in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii. “I just, I ached. I mean, it hurt. You know, I just felt so bad. Even though I didn’t know him, I loved him,” Kennedy said. Patten's funeral was a simple affair with just a few family members. But often when veterans who fought decades earlier are identified, people waving flags and holding signs line the streets of their hometowns to herald the return of their remains. “This work is important first and foremost because these are individuals that gave their lives to protect our freedom, and they paid the ultimate sacrifice. So we’re here holding that promise that we’ll return them home to their families,” Brown said. \"It’s important for their families to show them that we’ll never stop, no matter what,” she said. Often there are compelling details, Brown said. One of her first cases involved the intact remains of a World War I Marine found in a forest in France with his wallet still in his pocket. The wallet, initialed G.H., contained a New York Times article describing plans for the offensive in which he ultimately died. He also had an infantryman badge with his name and the year he received it on the back. Before leaving France with the remains, the team visited a local cemetery where other soldiers were buried and learned there were only two missing soldiers with the initials G.H. Brown had a fair idea who that soldier was before his remains even arrived in the lab. That veteran was buried in Arlington National Cemetery and Brown often visits his grave when she is in Washington D.C. Most cases aren’t that easy. The experts who work at the lab must piece together identities by looking at historical records about where the remains were found and which soldiers were in the area. They then consult the list of possible names and use the bones, objects found with them, military medical records and DNA to confirm their identities. They focus on battles and plane crashes where they have the greatest chance of success because of available information. But their work can be complicated if soldiers were buried in a temporary cemetery and moved when a unit was forced to retreat. And unidentified soldiers were often buried together. When remains are brought to the lab, they sometimes include an extra bone. Experts then spend months or even years matching the bones and waiting for DNA and other test results to confirm their identities. One test even can identify if the soldier grew up primarily eating rice or a corn-based diet. The lab also compares specific traits of collar bones to the chest X-rays the military routinely took of soldiers before they were deployed. It helps that the military keeps extensive records of all soldiers. Those clues help the experts put together the puzzle of someone's identity. “It’s not always easy. It’s certainly not instantaneous,” Brown said. “Some of the cases, we really have to fight to get to that spot, because some of them have been gone for 80 years.”",

        "description": "The Sage of Omaha has some great advice to call on. The post 3 pearls of Warren Buffett wisdom I think all ASX investors need right now appeared first on The Motley Fool Australia.",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is one of the world's greatest investors. , the business Buffett has led for decades, achieved an average annual return of 19.8% between 1965 and 2023. Buffett is also one of the world's most generous people with his money and advice. He plans to donate most of his huge wealth to charity. He also spends hours every year at the Berkshire Hathaway annual general meeting answering questions from shareholders and has given numerous pieces of advice over the years. I will talk about three Buffett pearls of wisdom that I think are very relevant to today's investment conditions. remains higher than central banks would like, so may stay at this level for longer. The US Federal Reserve boss said earlier in May: We did not expect this to be a smooth road. But these [inflation readings] were higher than I think anybody expected. What that has told us is that we'll need to be patient and let restrictive policy do its work. Of course, that doesn't mean we shouldn't invest at all. But, I believe investors should continue to assess company valuations on their merits and only buy if they think long-term returns can be solid. Warren Buffett once explained why are so important to valuations: The value of every business, the value of a farm, the value of an apartment house, the value of any economic asset, is 100% sensitive to interest rates because all you are doing in investing is transferring some money to somebody now in exchange for what you expect the stream of money to be, to come in over a period of time, and the higher interest rates are the less that present value is going to be. So every business by its nature...its intrinsic valuation is 100% sensitive to interest rates. At a time when the share prices of many businesses are close to 52-week highs or all-time highs, I think it would be reasonable for investors to be discerning about which investments they're buying. Investing is not like baseball, where batters must swing at pitches sooner or later. We can take our time with investments and only buy shares at a price we like. Warren Buffett explained how to handle investing in this situation: The trick in investing is just to sit there and watch pitch after pitch go by and wait for the one right in your sweet spot. And if people are yelling, 'Swing, you bum!,' ignore them. When the market does become fearful, that could be the time to be greedy. There doesn't need to be a to find opportunities, though; I've written plenty of articles recently where I see opportunities right now. There is a wide range of potential ASX share investments for us to buy. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger have been advocates of investors focusing on wonderful companies rather than average businesses. Warren Buffett said: It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price. By choosing great businesses, I think those investments are much more likely to deliver strong metrics such as a higher and better of over the long term. Owning wonderful companies can deliver good share price (and dividend) returns over time.",

        "content": "Losing Harry Kane, yet improving on the previous campaign, playing a better style of football and returning to Europe is a huge plus. Now will turn their attention to the summer transfer window and helping out their manager because their squad needs a boost. You wonder if the powers that be at Spurs would have had their eyes on the on Sunday at Wembley. and they made an instant return to the . On one hand, because it increases their chances of signing Crysencio Summerville from Leeds United. The Yorkshire outfit will spend another season in England’s second tier and Spurs have expressed interest in their star player, But their quest to sign another star – – could now prove to be difficult given that Southampton are now back in the big time. Tottenham Hotspur’s transfer interest in Kyle Walker-Peters Sources have told HITC football that Spurs have expressed interest in bringing back the fullback, but they aren’t willing to pay the £30 million buy-back clause in his deal. That was when the South Coast club were still a Championship team. This probably now strengthens their position and he is one of their best players. on the day – and like he did twice during the regular season – he locked down the winger and didn’t let him move. The fact that Summerville was subbed off just after 70 minutes, tells you everything you need to know about his performance and how Walker-Peters dealt with him. Kyle Walker-Peters at Tottenham The versatile fullback came through at Spurs and was highly rated amongst those at Hotspur Way. But they decided to move him on and he proceeded to do very well upon his move to St Mary’s, including earning two England caps. You can understand why there is interest from Spurs because Postecoglou needs cover at fullback and Walker-Peters can play on either side. Some would even probably argue that he has always been a better player than Emerson Royal – sources have suggested that there is .",

        "content": "Karan Kandhari ‘s “ Sister Midnight ” is a surreal Mumbai fable with an aggressive comedic rhythm. It’s composed by hitting the same few notes ad nauseam, but hitting them exceptionally well and for much longer than one might expect before it eventually runs out of steam. All the while, Kandhari takes a novel visual approach to the topic of arranged marriage, situating his woebegone couple — his protagonist in particular, a woman who feels trapped — in a realm of strange psychosis. It’s better than it has any right to be, but not nearly as good as it should be. Uma (Radhika Apte) is brash, acerbic and vulgar. Unable to cook or manage household expenses, she fulfills very few of the rigid expectations of a new Indian bride. When she arrives at her cramped new one-room apartment with her soft-spoken husband Gopal (Ashok Pathak) — an ostensible stranger — on their wedding night, the awkwardness between them is palpable. She wants to (or perhaps, believes it’s her duty to) sleep with him, but he can barely take his shirt off in front of her. It doesn’t take long for Kandhari to establish his snappy comedic vibe, with all the calculated framing, editing and choreography of a Wes Anderson action scene (the wake in “The Grand Budapest Hotel” comes to mind, with its litany of well-timed punches). However, first-time feature director Kandhari also marches to the beat of his own drum, constrained by neither tone nor genre expectation. His music choices range from Bengali folk to American punk and blues. While of Indian origin, Kandhari is London-based and draws from a variety of cultural influences, but his depiction of working class Mumbai never feels inauthentic, especially in the movie’s quieter, low-lit moments, whose shadowy visual contrast creates striking portraits of Uma that verge on expressionistic. While Gopal is at work, Uma tries to settle into a domestic routine, which involves everything from learning to chop vegetables to figuring out how to spend her free time in her crowded neighborhood, whose bustling noise prevents her from sleeping in. The happily married woman next door, Sheetal (played by Chhaya Kadam, who also stars in Cannes Grand Prix winner “All We Imagine As Light”) takes Uma under her wing and delivers even her most impassioned and welcoming lines with wry, impenetrable wit. It’s a role Kadam nails completely, finding variance even within comedic monotony, and she makes for an amusing contrast with Apte’s more fiery and unpredictable performance. Between Uma’s gossiping neighbors and the pressures of social expectation, her psyche begins to rip apart at the seams, until eventually she finds a particularly macabre outlet for her frustrations. When her anxieties begin to manifest in the world around her, Kandhari makes tremendously inventive use of stop-motion elements. They cause a kind of fissure in his world-building, revealing seamlessly blended images that don’t quite make logical sense or — like Uma herself — feel like they belong. However, the more sudden genre swerves “Sister Midnight” takes, the more Kandhari cedes control to an imagined version of his film that does not (and perhaps cannot) exist. His story holds Indian patriarchal norms to account and via its sensitive, anxious depiction of Gopal, makes him as much a victim of circumstance as Uma, if not more so. The exact subgenres from which “Sister Midnight” ultimately takes its cues are better left unspoiled, but several of its genre hallmarks harken back to films about the all-consuming nature of romance. However, the misfortunes that eventually befall Gopal, courtesy of Uma’s crumbling state of mind, lead to incongruous outcomes that feel too irreverently nasty. Kandhari has a clear and perverse vision, but he’s also incredibly successful (perhaps to a fault) at eliciting sympathy for his characters. The bleak, punk-feminist parable he tries to build, using phantasmagorical imagery, strays too far toward the realm of disturbing — both emotionally and viscerally — to fully connect and keep viewers on its wavelength. This dissonance also collides with (and perhaps contributes to) the movie’s clockwork rhythm becoming too mechanical to manage. Beyond a point, its visual comedy no longer remains unpredictable, and everything that initially works about its unique sensibilities becomes a burden, preventing “Sister Midnight” from undergoing the metamorphosis necessary to chase its initial surrealist high. The story soon gets away from Kandhari, leading to a film that enraptures and delights in its first hour but gets so locked in to a singular approach by its second that it’s practically consumed by its own style, rendering it unable to keep pace with the bold ideas at play.",

        "content": "OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. — Generations of American families have grown up not knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones who died while serving their country in World War II and other conflicts. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency forensic anthropologist Carrie Brown looks at objects in a lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. But a federal lab tucked away above the bowling alley at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha and a sister lab in Hawaii are steadily answering those lingering questions, aiming to offer 200 families per year the chance to honor their relatives with a proper burial. “They may not even have been alive when that service member was alive, but that story gets carried down through the generations,\" said Carrie Brown, a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab manager at Offutt. \"They may have seen on the mantle a picture of that person when they were little and not really understood or known who they were.” Memorial Day and the upcoming 80th anniversary of D-Day on June 6 are reminders of the urgency of Brown's work. The forensic anthropologists, medical examiners and historians who work together to identify lost soldiers are in a race against time as remains buried on battlefields around the globe deteriorate. But advances in DNA technology, combined with innovative techniques including comparing bones to chest X-rays taken by the military, mean the labs can identify more of the missing soldiers every year. Some 72,000 World War II soldiers remain unaccounted for, along with roughly 10,000 more from all the conflicts since. The experts believe about half of those are recoverable. The agency identified 59 servicemembers in 2013, when the Offutt lab first opened. That number has steadily risen — 159 service members last year, up from 134 in 2022 — and the labs have a goal of 200 identifications annually. Donna Kennedy holds a photo of her cousin Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, who was buried with full military honors, May 20 in Lawson, Mo. The labs' work allowed Donna Kennedy to bury her cousin, Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, with full military honors this month in the same Lawson, Missouri, cemetery where his father and grandfather are buried. Patten died 74 years ago during the Korean War, but spent decades buried as an unknown in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii. “I just, I ached. I mean, it hurt. You know, I just felt so bad. Even though I didn’t know him, I loved him,” Kennedy said. Patten's funeral was a simple affair with just a few family members. But often when veterans who fought decades earlier are identified, people waving flags and holding signs line the streets of their hometowns to herald the return of their remains. “This work is important first and foremost because these are individuals that gave their lives to protect our freedom, and they paid the ultimate sacrifice. So we’re here holding that promise that we’ll return them home to their families,” Brown said. Photos of service members are seen on a wall in a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. \"It’s important for their families to show them that we’ll never stop, no matter what,” she said. Often there are compelling details, Brown said. One of her first cases involved the intact remains of a World War I Marine found in a forest in France with his wallet still in his pocket. The wallet, initialed G.H., contained a New York Times article describing plans for the offensive in which he ultimately died. He also had an infantryman badge with his name and the year he received it on the back. Before leaving France with the remains, the team visited a local cemetery where other soldiers were buried and learned there were only two missing soldiers with the initials G.H. Brown had a fair idea who that soldier was before his remains even arrived in the lab. That veteran was buried in Arlington National Cemetery and Brown often visits his grave when she is in Washington D.C. Most cases aren’t that easy. A worker looks at objects in a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. The experts who work at the lab must piece together identities by looking at historical records about where the remains were found and which soldiers were in the area. They then consult the list of possible names and use the bones, objects found with them, military medical records and DNA to confirm their identities. They focus on battles and plane crashes where they have the greatest chance of success because of available information. But their work can be complicated if soldiers were buried in a temporary cemetery and moved when a unit was forced to retreat. And unidentified soldiers were often buried together. When remains are brought to the lab, they sometimes include an extra bone. Experts then spend months or even years matching the bones and waiting for DNA and other test results to confirm their identities. One test even can identify if the soldier grew up primarily eating rice or a corn-based diet. The lab also compares specific traits of collar bones to the chest X-rays the military routinely took of soldiers before they were deployed. It helps that the military keeps extensive records of all soldiers. Those clues help the experts put together the puzzle of someone's identity. “It’s not always easy. It’s certainly not instantaneous,” Brown said. “Some of the cases, we really have to fight to get to that spot, because some of them have been gone for 80 years.” A man looks at a damaged car after a tornado hit the day before, Sunday, May 26, 2024, in Valley View, Texas.

        "content": "A 16-year-old Winston-Salem teenager drowned this weekend while visiting Jordan Lake in Chatham County. Bryan Guzman was visiting Jordan Lake with his 18-year-old brother and a friend to celebrate a friend’s birthday, according to the Chatham County Sheriff’s Office. Deputies said the incident occurred around 3:30 p.m. Sunday near the Ebenezer Picnic Area A at 542 Ebenezer Road, New Hill. Guzman’s 18-year-old brother called 911, saying that Guzman was in distress while swimming in a cove near the picnic area. Officials said the cove is not a designated swimming area. “We extend our deepest condolences to the Guzman family during this very difficult time,” said Sheriff Mike Roberson. “Our hearts go out to them as they mourn the loss of their son and brother.” People are also reading... In addition to the Chatham County Sheriff’s Office, first responders included North Chatham Fire Department, Jordan Lake State Parks, and FirstHealth EMS. The Chatham County Sheriff's Office’s Victim Services Unit is working with the Guzman family to provide support and resources, officials said. The sheriff’s office is urging all visitors to Jordan Lake and other lakes to keep safety in mind: - Wear a life jacket. - Swim only in designated areas. - Supervise children closely. - Be aware of water conditions and your surroundings.

        "content": "OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. — Generations of American families have grown up not knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones who died while serving their country in World War II and other conflicts. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency forensic anthropologist Carrie Brown looks at objects in a lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. Charlie Neibergall, Associated Press But a federal lab tucked away above the bowling alley at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha and a sister lab in Hawaii are steadily answering those lingering questions, aiming to offer 200 families per year the chance to honor their relatives with a proper burial. “They may not even have been alive when that service member was alive, but that story gets carried down through the generations,\" said Carrie Brown, a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab manager at Offutt. \"They may have seen on the mantle a picture of that person when they were little and not really understood or known who they were.” Memorial Day and the upcoming 80th anniversary of D-Day on June 6 are reminders of the urgency of Brown's work. The forensic anthropologists, medical examiners and historians who work together to identify lost soldiers are in a race against time as remains buried on battlefields around the globe deteriorate. But advances in DNA technology, combined with innovative techniques including comparing bones to chest X-rays taken by the military, mean the labs can identify more of the missing soldiers every year. Some 72,000 World War II soldiers remain unaccounted for, along with roughly 10,000 more from all the conflicts since. The experts believe about half of those are recoverable. The agency identified 59 servicemembers in 2013, when the Offutt lab first opened. That number has steadily risen — 159 service members last year, up from 134 in 2022 — and the labs have a goal of 200 identifications annually. Donna Kennedy holds a photo of her cousin Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, who was buried with full military honors, May 20 in Lawson, Mo. Nick Ingram, Associated Press The labs' work allowed Donna Kennedy to bury her cousin, Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, with full military honors this month in the same Lawson, Missouri, cemetery where his father and grandfather are buried. Patten died 74 years ago during the Korean War, but spent decades buried as an unknown in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii. “I just, I ached. I mean, it hurt. You know, I just felt so bad. Even though I didn’t know him, I loved him,” Kennedy said. Patten's funeral was a simple affair with just a few family members. But often when veterans who fought decades earlier are identified, people waving flags and holding signs line the streets of their hometowns to herald the return of their remains. “This work is important first and foremost because these are individuals that gave their lives to protect our freedom, and they paid the ultimate sacrifice. So we’re here holding that promise that we’ll return them home to their families,” Brown said.

Often there are compelling details, Brown said. One of her first cases involved the intact remains of a World War I Marine found in a forest in France with his wallet still in his pocket. The wallet, initialed G.H., contained a New York Times article describing plans for the offensive in which he ultimately died. He also had an infantryman badge with his name and the year he received it on the back. Before leaving France with the remains, the team visited a local cemetery where other soldiers were buried and learned there were only two missing soldiers with the initials G.H. Brown had a fair idea who that soldier was before his remains even arrived in the lab. That veteran was buried in Arlington National Cemetery and Brown often visits his grave when she is in Washington D.C. Most cases aren’t that easy. A worker looks at objects in a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. Charlie Neibergall, Associated Press The experts who work at the lab must piece together identities by looking at historical records about where the remains were found and which soldiers were in the area. They then consult the list of possible names and use the bones, objects found with them, military medical records and DNA to confirm their identities. They focus on battles and plane crashes where they have the greatest chance of success because of available information. But their work can be complicated if soldiers were buried in a temporary cemetery and moved when a unit was forced to retreat. And unidentified soldiers were often buried together. When remains are brought to the lab, they sometimes include an extra bone. Experts then spend months or even years matching the bones and waiting for DNA and other test results to confirm their identities. One test even can identify if the soldier grew up primarily eating rice or a corn-based diet. The lab also compares specific traits of collar bones to the chest X-rays the military routinely took of soldiers before they were deployed. It helps that the military keeps extensive records of all soldiers. Those clues help the experts put together the puzzle of someone's identity. “It’s not always easy. It’s certainly not instantaneous,” Brown said. “Some of the cases, we really have to fight to get to that spot, because some of them have been gone for 80 years.” A man looks at a damaged car after a tornado hit the day before, Sunday, May 26, 2024, in Valley View, Texas.

Teun Koopmeiners, also at Atalanta, has been linked with a move to Liverpool having worked with Slot at AZ Alkmaar. However, and bringing the former Corinthians star to Anfield. A fee in the region of €50m (£42m) has been mooted with Manchester United, Newcastle and Tottenham all interested. The midfield of Slot's team is one of the problematic areas in the squad and more than one player could be signed. After losing a host of midfielders 12 months ago, Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai proved to be good signings with Wataru Endo doing the job as the defensive anchor. However, reinforcements are expected to be made. Ederson is a strong midfielder who boasts terrific defensive numbers, ranking in the 72nd percentile for tackles and 85th percentile for interceptions. Should Liverpool bring the Brazilian to Merseyside, then Slot could find himself with a variety of options to choose from. Alongside Mac Allister and Szoboszlai, that trio is full of quality. With Stefan Bajcetic, Curtis Jones, Ryan Gravenberch and Harvey Elliot waiting in the wings, the signing of Ederson could be the perfect signing for Liverpool. Having the array of options to choose from off the bench or in cup competitions would help Slot's transition to English football no end.",

        "content": "The Kelowna Rockets have signed Owen Hayden, their first-round pick (ninth overall) from the 2024 WHL Prospects Draft, to a WHL Scholarship and Development Agreement. “I am excited to sign with the Rockets,” Hayden said. “Kelowna is such a great city and the organization has developed so many amazing defencemen, including Shea Weber and Tyler Myers.” At just 15 years old, the 6-foot-6, 194-pound defenceman has already made a name for himself. Hayden led the Calgary NWCAA U15 AAA Flames (AEHL) defense in scoring this season, racking up 24 points (1 goal, 23 assists) and 40 penalty minutes over 30 games. In the playoffs, he added another eight penalty minutes in four games. “Owen is a puck-moving defender who utilizes his size and reach to disrupt plays,” said Rockets assistant general manager Curtis Hamilton. “We are excited to welcome Owen and his family to the Rockets.” The WHL Scholarship provides players with a year of post-secondary education for each season they play in the WHL. The scholarship covers tuition, fees, and textbooks, allowing players to attend universities, colleges, technical institutes, and trade schools.",

        "content": "OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. — Generations of American families have grown up not knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones who died while serving their country in World War II and other conflicts. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency forensic anthropologist Carrie Brown looks at objects in a lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. But a federal lab tucked away above the bowling alley at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha and a sister lab in Hawaii are steadily answering those lingering questions, aiming to offer 200 families per year the chance to honor their relatives with a proper burial. “They may not even have been alive when that service member was alive, but that story gets carried down through the generations,\" said Carrie Brown, a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab manager at Offutt. \"They may have seen on the mantle a picture of that person when they were little and not really understood or known who they were.” Memorial Day and the upcoming 80th anniversary of D-Day on June 6 are reminders of the urgency of Brown's work. The forensic anthropologists, medical examiners and historians who work together to identify lost soldiers are in a race against time as remains buried on battlefields around the globe deteriorate. But advances in DNA technology, combined with innovative techniques including comparing bones to chest X-rays taken by the military, mean the labs can identify more of the missing soldiers every year. Some 72,000 World War II soldiers remain unaccounted for, along with roughly 10,000 more from all the conflicts since. The experts believe about half of those are recoverable. The agency identified 59 servicemembers in 2013, when the Offutt lab first opened. That number has steadily risen — 159 service members last year, up from 134 in 2022 — and the labs have a goal of 200 identifications annually. Donna Kennedy holds a photo of her cousin Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, who was buried with full military honors, May 20 in Lawson, Mo. The labs' work allowed Donna Kennedy to bury her cousin, Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, with full military honors this month in the same Lawson, Missouri, cemetery where his father and grandfather are buried. Patten died 74 years ago during the Korean War, but spent decades buried as an unknown in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii. “I just, I ached. I mean, it hurt. You know, I just felt so bad. Even though I didn’t know him, I loved him,” Kennedy said. Patten's funeral was a simple affair with just a few family members. But often when veterans who fought decades earlier are identified, people waving flags and holding signs line the streets of their hometowns to herald the return of their remains. “This work is important first and foremost because these are individuals that gave their lives to protect our freedom, and they paid the ultimate sacrifice. So we’re here holding that promise that we’ll return them home to their families,” Brown said. Photos of service members are seen on a wall in a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. \"It’s important for their families to show them that we’ll never stop, no matter what,” she said. Often there are compelling details, Brown said. One of her first cases involved the intact remains of a World War I Marine found in a forest in France with his wallet still in his pocket. The wallet, initialed G.H., contained a New York Times article describing plans for the offensive in which he ultimately died. He also had an infantryman badge with his name and the year he received it on the back. Before leaving France with the remains, the team visited a local cemetery where other soldiers were buried and learned there were only two missing soldiers with the initials G.H. Brown had a fair idea who that soldier was before his remains even arrived in the lab. That veteran was buried in Arlington National Cemetery and Brown often visits his grave when she is in Washington D.C. Most cases aren’t that easy. A worker looks at objects in a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. The experts who work at the lab must piece together identities by looking at historical records about where the remains were found and which soldiers were in the area. They then consult the list of possible names and use the bones, objects found with them, military medical records and DNA to confirm their identities. They focus on battles and plane crashes where they have the greatest chance of success because of available information. But their work can be complicated if soldiers were buried in a temporary cemetery and moved when a unit was forced to retreat. And unidentified soldiers were often buried together. When remains are brought to the lab, they sometimes include an extra bone. Experts then spend months or even years matching the bones and waiting for DNA and other test results to confirm their identities. One test even can identify if the soldier grew up primarily eating rice or a corn-based diet. The lab also compares specific traits of collar bones to the chest X-rays the military routinely took of soldiers before they were deployed. It helps that the military keeps extensive records of all soldiers. Those clues help the experts put together the puzzle of someone's identity. “It’s not always easy. It’s certainly not instantaneous,” Brown said. “Some of the cases, we really have to fight to get to that spot, because some of them have been gone for 80 years.” A man looks at a damaged car after a tornado hit the day before, Sunday, May 26, 2024, in Valley View, Texas.

        "content": "After breaking into the music industry earlier this year , North West has made her acting debut at the age of 10 when she joined The Lion King’s 30th Anniversary concert last week. The Kardashians star was cast as Young Simba in the celebratory event at the Hollywood Bowl where she performed I Just Can’t Wait To Be King. North received a standing ovation at The Hollywood Bowl but viewers online have had a less than stellar reaction to the rising star’s role. Kim Kardashian and Kanye reunite to watch North make charming stage debut in The Lion King North West exposes Kim Kardashian’s real skin – pimples and all Some social media users on X , formerly known as Twitter, lashed out at the eldest child of reality star Kim Kardashian and controversial rapper Kanye West claiming nepotism played a role in her casting. One claimed it was “the worst case of nepo I have witnessed” while another lamented: “Someone else's more talented, probably voice and dance trained kid didn't get it because his/her family isn't famous enough.” A few sympathetic viewers reach out to the rising star, admitting: “She looks great and it seems like she's having a lot of fun, but I'm definitely not gonna bypass the fact that we all know she wouldn't be there if it wasn't who her parents were.” On TikTok , viewers were far more concerned with the 10-year-old’s costume, brutally hitting out at her father saying that while the rest of the cast was dressed for Broadway, North was “wearing Simba by Ye”. One even branded the entire concert as a rip-off of the beloved Disney classic writing: “This is like the SHEIN version of lion king.” Many lamented the countless other talented children that auditioned but lost the role to North and it’s currently unclear if the burgeoning rapper went through the standard audition process.

Daily Express has contacted a Kardashians representative for comment. North joined a slew of other A-listers on the stage over the weekend for a two-night-only run including Jennifer Hudson, Billy Eichner, Bradley Gibson and Jason Weaver as well as stars from the original 1994 voice cast Ernie Sabella, Jeremy Irons and Nathan Lane. North’s landmark performance also briefly reunited her parents after their brutal high-profile divorce as Kanye cheered his daughter on from the crowd while her mom, Kim, supported her backstage with some candid snaps from her dressing room.",

They focus on battles and plane crashes where they have the greatest chance of success because of available information. But their work can be complicated if soldiers were buried in a temporary cemetery and moved when a unit was forced to retreat. And unidentified soldiers were often buried together. When remains are brought to the lab, they sometimes include an extra bone. Experts then spend months or even years matching the bones and waiting for DNA and other test results to confirm their identities. One test even can identify if the soldier grew up primarily eating rice or a corn-based diet. The lab also compares specific traits of collar bones to the chest X-rays the military routinely took of soldiers before they were deployed. It helps that the military keeps extensive records of all soldiers. Those clues help the experts put together the puzzle of someone's identity. “It’s not always easy. It’s certainly not instantaneous,” Brown said. “Some of the cases, we really have to fight to get to that spot, because some of them have been gone for 80 years.” A man looks at a damaged car after a tornado hit the day before, Sunday, May 26, 2024, in Valley View, Texas.

        "content": "Former Germany and Bayern Munich manager Hansi Flick is on the verge of officially becoming the new manager of FC Barcelona, replacing the outbound Xavi Hernandez. For a brief period of time, he was linked with possibly making a return to Bayern to replace Thomas Tuchel, as was Julian Nagelsmann, but Flick wanted to experience a new challenge in a different country for the next chapter of his life. Flick will have a full summer transfer window to help with his squad planning efforts at Barcelona before his first full season in charge of the club, and reports have suggested he is going to be looking towards the Bundesliga for some of his transfer targets. In a market he knows quite well given his time as Bayern’s manager, the German national team manager, and his long tenure as an assistant member of Joachim Löw’s Germany coaching staff. Naturally, there have been rumors that Flick would like to try to bring Bayern’s Joshua Kimmich to Barcelona, but information from Az’s Maximilian Koch (via @iMiaSanMia ) suggests that is not a hot topic at the moment for either club. With the European Championships right around the corner for Germany, that is Kimmich’s full focus at the moment. Photo by Stefan Matzke - sampics/Corbis via Getty Images Kimmich’s current contract at Bayern is set to expire in June 2025, so it is a crucial period for the player in terms of needing to get his future sorted out, whether that is with Bayern, or elsewhere. So far, there have not been concrete talks yet between the player and the club’s front office, though Max Eberl and Christoph Freund will certainly have to open discussions as soon as they can after the Euros have ended. Kimmich does not have an agent and currently represents himself, which should help the contract talk process go smoother as it is a more direct line of communication without the presence of an agent or representatives, but only time will how negotiations will go. He will more than likely have conversations with Vincent Kompany about the upcoming season and where he sees Kimmich in his Bayern side as a part of the contract talk process. The time they are a changin’ at Bayern Munich. Vincent Kompany looks like he is taking over in Bavaria, while the club’s former favorite son — Hansi Flick — is heading to FC Barcelona . Which one will make out better with their new club? We’ll find out, but in the meantime, there could also be some Bayern players who are on Flick’s transfer radar, too. basically, we’ve got a lot to talk about with all of that, plus some appreciation for Bayer Leverkusen’s incredible season. You can check all of that out on the Bavarians Podcast Works Show, which is available on Spotify or below: Related Hansi Flick’s four-step plan to raid the Bundesliga for FC Barcelona Report: Bayern Munich wants winger, stiker, holding midfielder — and maybe a left-back and a center-back, too",

        "description": "Generations of American families have grown up not knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones who died while serving their country in World War II and other conflicts. But a federal lab aims to answer those questions.",
        "content": "OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. — Generations of American families have grown up not knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones who died while serving their country in World War II and other conflicts. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency forensic anthropologist Carrie Brown looks at objects in a lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. But a federal lab tucked away above the bowling alley at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha and a sister lab in Hawaii are steadily answering those lingering questions, aiming to offer 200 families per year the chance to honor their relatives with a proper burial. “They may not even have been alive when that service member was alive, but that story gets carried down through the generations,\" said Carrie Brown, a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab manager at Offutt. \"They may have seen on the mantle a picture of that person when they were little and not really understood or known who they were.” Memorial Day and the upcoming 80th anniversary of D-Day on June 6 are reminders of the urgency of Brown's work. The forensic anthropologists, medical examiners and historians who work together to identify lost soldiers are in a race against time as remains buried on battlefields around the globe deteriorate. People are also reading... But advances in DNA technology, combined with innovative techniques including comparing bones to chest X-rays taken by the military, mean the labs can identify more of the missing soldiers every year. Some 72,000 World War II soldiers remain unaccounted for, along with roughly 10,000 more from all the conflicts since. The experts believe about half of those are recoverable. The agency identified 59 servicemembers in 2013, when the Offutt lab first opened. That number has steadily risen — 159 service members last year, up from 134 in 2022 — and the labs have a goal of 200 identifications annually. Donna Kennedy holds a photo of her cousin Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, who was buried with full military honors, May 20 in Lawson, Mo. The labs' work allowed Donna Kennedy to bury her cousin, Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, with full military honors this month in the same Lawson, Missouri, cemetery where his father and grandfather are buried. Patten died 74 years ago during the Korean War, but spent decades buried as an unknown in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii. “I just, I ached. I mean, it hurt. You know, I just felt so bad. Even though I didn’t know him, I loved him,” Kennedy said. Patten's funeral was a simple affair with just a few family members. But often when veterans who fought decades earlier are identified, people waving flags and holding signs line the streets of their hometowns to herald the return of their remains. “This work is important first and foremost because these are individuals that gave their lives to protect our freedom, and they paid the ultimate sacrifice. So we’re here holding that promise that we’ll return them home to their families,” Brown said. Photos of service members are seen on a wall in a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. \"It’s important for their families to show them that we’ll never stop, no matter what,” she said. Often there are compelling details, Brown said. One of her first cases involved the intact remains of a World War I Marine found in a forest in France with his wallet still in his pocket. The wallet, initialed G.H., contained a New York Times article describing plans for the offensive in which he ultimately died. He also had an infantryman badge with his name and the year he received it on the back. Before leaving France with the remains, the team visited a local cemetery where other soldiers were buried and learned there were only two missing soldiers with the initials G.H. Brown had a fair idea who that soldier was before his remains even arrived in the lab. That veteran was buried in Arlington National Cemetery and Brown often visits his grave when she is in Washington D.C. Most cases aren’t that easy. A worker looks at objects in a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. The experts who work at the lab must piece together identities by looking at historical records about where the remains were found and which soldiers were in the area.

They focus on battles and plane crashes where they have the greatest chance of success because of available information.

        "content": "fans were left scratching their heads as , despite there being none left. Japanese double dutch group Haribow took to the stage, ready to blend skipping with gymnastic and dance moves in a bid to win the show. The friends, who had been performing together for nine years, revealed they'd travelled over 20 hours for their audition. As their routine kicked off, the audience went wild, cheering and applauding their performance. The judges were equally impressed, and by the time the performance ended, the cheers were so loud that the judges' feedback was drowned out. The crowd began chanting for the judges to hit the Golden Buzzer, but confirmed they couldn't. They'd already exceeded their one-buzzer limit this series, having pressed it several times more than allowed. However, this time they held firm, even as Simon's son Eric and Amanda Holden's daughter Hollie were seen jumping around in the audience. Simon shared with the group how excited Eric was about them, clearly a fan. As the chants grew louder, Simon realised they wouldn't be able to avoid giving them the buzzer. But amid the rule-breaking excitement, it was . The pair dashed up to press the buzzer, sending the crowd and those on stage into a frenzy. While viewers at home acknowledged the act's talent, opinions were split on its Golden Buzzer worthiness, with some pointing out that the value of the buzzer is diminished when so many acts are chosen regardless of the rules. Some fans argued it negates the purpose of the buzzer's exclusivity. One viewer tweeted: \"What's the point in the golden buzzers when they're just giving them out to absolutely everyone? These guys are really good but when they're gone they're gone! !\" Another concurred: \"They don't need to golden buzzer everything. If they're that good they'll get picked to go through anyway.\" Meanwhile, a third spectator commented: \"They know there's no buzzers left, but they still won't stfu about pushing it. It devalues every other golden buzzer act,\" while a fourth remarked: \"What's the point of the golden buzzer, they would get through to the finals anyway.\" The previous day had seen from Simon after delivering an astonishing performance for judges Simon, , , and Amanda. The duo showcased their talent with a series of moves and lifts on a platform, even being suspended off the ground at one point. The performance was elevated by pyrotechnics, earning them applause from the judges. Amanda could hardly bear to watch as they spun high up with minimal support. As their audition concluded, the judges gave them a standing ovation, with the audience also cheering them on. The crowd loved it so much that they started chanting for the judges to hit the Golden Buzzer. However, some viewers were left scratching their heads over the rules, unsure if another buzzer should have been given considering how many had already been awarded.",
