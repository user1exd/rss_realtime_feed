The veteran actor with an envious 49-year career in cinema was talking with Kaumudi movies as part of the promotion work of the movie when he cleared the air about not acting alongside actor Mohanlal for the past 13 years. Mohanlal and Maniyanpilla Raju are school friends and still carry the bonhomie. Maniyanpilla Raju: “It has been long 13 years since I shared the screen with Lal. We talk with each other daily and share jokes. But It hasn’t chanced upon me to ask for a role in his next films. There are friends among us who request Lal for roles in his next movie. Being Lal, it is normal for him to not turn anyone down and those people will be there in some roles in Lal's movies. But I believe that roles come to us if it is fit for us to perform. There is no point in pestering someone for roles. Just see for the fact that I am acting alongside Lal in Tharun Moorthy’s movie. A great role to play. See, these roles come to us, and I believe in destiny more than anything. “",

I know the job market's hard but we're all in it together. You don't have to steal - especially take a life over it.' She said 'human life is disregarded too easy' and argued that it is time we 'make changes as a community' and 'support each other', adding: 'Maybe that's what Johnny's gift is for us, maybe he's gifting that to all of us.'

Violent crime in Los Angeles has been on the rise, with the LAPD recording a 2.9 per cent increase at the end of March 2024, compared to the same time last year. The LAPD reported Friday that, as of the end of April, the city's rise in the number of murders in 2024 continued to decline and, as of April 27, was only 4.2 per cent above the number of murders reported at this time in 2023, NBC Los Angeles reported. The last time the force updated robbery statistics, at the end of March 2024, thefts were up 9.5 per cent, according to ABC 7. Around 600,000 catalytic converters are stolen each year. Most cars are equipped with one converter but those with a dual exhaust system require two. Larger vehicles such as SUVs and trucks may have more than two. According to the New York Times, stolen catalytic converters are passed through 'middlemen, smelters and refineries in the United States and overseas.' They can be stolen in under a minute and cost around $1,000 to replace.

        "content": "Rafael Nadal might skip Wimbledon in a bid to be match-fit for 2024 Paris Olympics Rafael Nadal might miss Wimbledon, the grass court Grand Slam, in order to be match ready for the upcoming 2024 Paris Olympics. The Spaniard, after his first-round exit at the ongoing 2024 French Open, opined it would not be ‘smart’ for him to compete in a Grand Slam right before the Olympics. Nadal was ousted from the French Open in the first round by fourth seed Alexander Zverev. This was the first time Nadal has exited the French Open, a tournament he has won a record 14 times, in the first round. Zverev won 6-3 ,7-6(5), 6-3. Zverev became the third player in the history of the sport to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, behind Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling. The 37-year-old southpaw opined that playing a Grand Slam (Wimbledon in this case) and the Olympics in quick succession wouldn’t be smart on his part, especially given he has been struggling to cope up with injuries. “I can’t confirm anything, but I don’t think it’s smart after everything my body has been through,” he said. Nadal explained the reason behind thinking of skipping Wimbledon. “It will be difficult playing on grass, considering that right after Wimbledon are the Olympic Games,” he said. Nadal won Wimbledon twice—in 2008 and 2010—but also endured some of his toughest moments at the All England Club. He last played in the tournament in 2022, when he was forced to withdraw before his semifinal against Nick Kyrgios with an abdomen strain.",

        "content": "Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana said he is prepared to stay in his current role after the election and urged the country to choose stability over “chaos” by voting for the African National Congress. “If I am asked to serve I will serve,” he said Tuesday in an interview on Bloomberg Television with Jennifer Zabasajja. “What these elections are about — are about stability and chaos — and the ANC provides that stability.” South Africans vote on Wednesday, with Godongwana’s ruling ANC facing its toughest election fight since taking power in 1994. Opinion polls show ANC support dipping below 50%, which would force it into a coalition with a smaller rival. But recent rand strength suggests investors see it doing well enough to form a government without hooking up with parties to its left, which could push the country in a more populist and less market-friendly direction. Godongwana voiced confidence that the party will get over the line. “The ANC is working on the assumption that we’re going to have 50 plus one.”",

        "content": "It is \"very unlikely\" more survivors of Papua New Guinea's deadly landslide will be found, a UN agency warned on Tuesday, as thousands at risk from further slips were ordered to evacuate. Some 2 000 people are feared buried by a massive landslide that entombed a remote highland community in the early hours of 24 May. Since then, locals have been picking through a hellscape of metres-deep churned-up earth, uprooted trees and car-sized boulders in the search for loved ones - often using little more than their hands, shovels and digging sticks. But hopes are dimming that anyone is alive underneath the mountain of rubble. \"It is not a rescue mission, it is a recovery mission,\" Unicef Papua New Guinea's Niels Kraaier told AFP. \"It is very unlikely they will have survived.\" READ | 'We are racing against time': Fears of another slide as 670 bodies found in Papua New Guinea Full-scale rescue and relief efforts have been severely hampered by the remote location, the only road link being severed, heavy rainfall and nearby tribal violence. The Papua New Guinea Defence Forces have struggled to access the site with heavy earth-moving equipment. Early on Tuesday, Enga provincial administrator Sandis Tsaka warned the disaster could worsen further, as clumps of limestone, dirt and rock continue to shear off the side of Mount Mungalo. Tsaka told AFP authorities were now trying to coordinate the evacuation of almost 7 900 more people. He said: \"Every hour you can hear rock breaking - it is like a bomb or gunshot and the rocks keep falling down.\" Aid officials said many residents were refusing to leave at-risk areas because they were holding out hope of finding loved ones. Satellite images show the enormous scale of the disaster. A vast smear of yellow and grey debris can be seen cutting through once verdant bushland and severing the region's only road. \"This was an area heavily populated with homes, businesses, churches and schools, it has been completely wiped out. It is the surface of the moon - it is just rocks,\" said Tsaka. \"People are digging with their hands and fingers,\" he said, expressing anguish at the under-resourced government's inability to meet the enormity of the disaster. \"I am not equipped to deal with this tragedy,\" Tsaka admitted. Overwhelmed Papua New Guinea authorities held an online emergency meeting with United Nations agencies and international allies Tuesday, hoping to kickstart the relief effort. Papua New Guinea's national disaster centre has told the United Nations that the initial \"landslide buried more than 2 000 people alive\". According to a letter obtained by AFP, the slide also \"caused major destruction to buildings, food gardens and caused major impact on the economic lifeline of the country\". The scale of the catastrophe required \"immediate and collaborative actions from all players\", it added, including the army, and national and provincial responders. Australia has announced millions of dollars' worth of aid, including emergency relief supplies such as shelters, hygiene kits and support for women and children. China's President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden - more accustomed to scrapping for influence in the strategically located country - both offered assistance. More than 1 000 people have already been displaced by the catastrophe, aid agencies have estimated. UN Development Programme official Nicholas Booth said up to 30 000 people could have been cut off by the disaster across several villages. These communities had enough supplies for the coming weeks, but opening up that road remained essential, he said. \"This landslide has blocked the road westward, so not only are there challenges in accessing the village itself, but it does mean the communities beyond that are also cut off.\" Locals said the landslip may have been triggered by recent heavy rains. Papua New Guinea has one of the wettest climates in the world, and research has found shifting rainfall patterns linked to climate change could exacerbate the risk of landslides. The estimated death toll has climbed significantly since the disaster struck, as officials reassess the size of the population. Many people fleeing tribal violence have moved into the area in the past few years. The area is located about 600km from Port Moresby.",

        "content": "NAIROBI, Kenya, May 28 – The Council of Governors have lauded Members of Parliament for reaching a consensus to allocate Sh400 billion to devolved units following protracted battles between the two houses on the shareable revenue allocation. The County Bosses expressed their gratitude to Senators for remaining adamant to push the shareable revenue to counties upwards by Sh9 billion in the incoming financial year 2024/2025 which commences in June. “Devolution is sacrosanct in the constitution and adequately resourcing functions that counties are mandated to deliver is progressive and a welcome move,” COG chairperson Waiguru stated. The mediation team of the two houses reached a consensus following differing proposal as the Senate initially pushing to have Counties allocated Sh415 billion while the National Assembly wanted the counties allocated Sh391 billion. The stalemate on the matter was ironed out after the Senate and National Assembly reached an agreement over the allocation for shareable revenue in the financial year 2024/2025 following days taken in lengthy deliberations. National Assembly Budget Committee Chairman Ndindi Nyoro who co-chaired the talks exuded confidence that progress had been made. “The Senate has agreed to reduce their figure by Sh15 billion while the National Assembly has agreed to push up its earlier figure by Sh9 billion in the spirit of give and take so that we can resolve this matter and allow Counties to get their increased allocation from Sh385 billion in the last financial year,” Nyoro stated. Senate Deputy Speaker Kathuri Murungi who co-chaired committee called upon county bosses to ensure championing of development in their respective counties through prudent use of resources. “We have held lengthy deliberations and we are all in agreement that devolution I’d working and that it should be supported by ensuring that counties get sufficient funds to carry out the devolved functions,” Murungi said. Senate Speaker Amason Kingi and National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetangula appointed nine members each to join the mediation team so as to iron out the stalemate that would have affected the counties. Murungi and Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro were elected as the co- chairmen for the mediation committee. Wetangula appointed Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro, Teso South MP Mary Emase, Ugenya MP David Ochieng, Alego Usonga MP Samuel Atandi, Kapenguria MP Samuel Moroto,Kitutu Chache North MP Japheth Nyakundi,Samburu West MP Naisula Lesuuda, Kitui Central MP Makali Mulu, and Garsen MP Ali Wario to be members of this team. Kingi appointed Senate Deputy Speaker Kathuri Murungi, Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang, Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale, Nairobi Senator Edwin Sifuna, Isiolo Senator Fatuma Dullo, Uasin Gishu Senator Jackson Mandago, Machakos Senator Kavindu Muthama, Marsabit Senator Mohammed Chute and Migori Senator Eddy Oketch to be members of the committee.

Sabrina recently opened up about her 'fun' and 'messy' love life as she gave an insight into her romance with Barry. The singer and Dunkirk actor were first linked in September 2023, but made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala earlier this month. Sabrina has now said she 'really connects with people who are in touch with their emotions' as discussed her romance with Cosmopolitan magazine. When it comes to dating, Sabrina said: 'A lot of it, for me, has been fate. I know that's super broad, but I don't actively look for it. 'The relationships that I actually want to put my energy into have to be so interesting or invigorating because they take me away from the other things I love. So yeah, it's fun and it's messy.' The songstress revealed she is 'attracted' to someone who becomes her 'best friend' and can bring a lot of 'energy and humour' to a relationship. Discussing her type, Sabrina added: 'I'm super attracted to a lot of the things I look for in friends because I want to be with someone who's going to be one of my best friends. So a lot of it is energy and humour and being genuine. I will say I've always connected more with people who are really in touch with their emotions.' Sabrina was first linked to Barry last September but they didn't make their first public appearance together until the December. In February, the couple confirmed their romance as they posed at a Grammys afterparty together after posing separately next to each other on the red carpet. Earlier this month, Barry threw Sabrina a lavish 25th birthday party complete with an hilarious meme birthday cake of Leonardo DiCaprio. The singer enjoyed a party with 100 of her friends thrown by the Saltburn actor at DUMBO House in Brooklyn. Barry has also supported Sabrina at a number of her gigs including her first at Coachella music festival. Barry was previously in a relationship with Alyson Kierans, who he welcomed a son with called Brando in August 2022 . The pair are thought to have broken up over the summer of last year. When Barry was asked about the split in GQ early this year, he said only that Alyson had 'done a great job and she’s an incredible mother.' Sabrina, meanwhile, saw her dating life become a hot topic during the summer of 2020, when she was rumoured to be in a love triangle with Joshua Bassett and his High School Musical: The Musical: The Series co-star Olivia Rodrigo . The following year, Olivia poured fuel on the fire by releasing her runaway smash hit single Driver's License, which was widely thought to be about Joshua and Sabrina. 'And you're probably with that blonde girl, who always made me doubt. She's so much older than me,' sang Olivia, who is nearly four years younger than Sabrina. In the interim, Sabrina has at various stages been linked to such names as pop act Shawn Mendes, Teen Wolf actor Dylan O'Brien and YouTuber David Dobrik.

Travis's recent fashion statement is under scrutiny after being photographed in a heavily-ripped jeans on Sunday. The NFL player was spotted outside next to Patrick Mahomes and Marquise Brown during Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Dallas Mavericks at the American Airlines Center in Dallas. However, his unique pants stole the limelight as netizens were intrigued by his pants with rips all over when the photos emerged on social media. One witty X (formerly known as Twitter) user proposed that perhaps Taylor Swift's cats were responsible for the look. “What the f*** did taylor cats do with his jeans?” @thisisvertrying quipped alongside a photo of the torn jeans. The joke caught Jason's attention who also endorsed it by reposting it with the caption, “Now that’s funny!” Travis paired the tattered jeans with sunglasses and a white shirt with an apple print. Travis was all smiles as he made the Rock On sign with his hands.",

On Friday, May 24 which also marked Dylan's 83rd birthday, the rare body of artwork was sold for $196,156 at an auction by RR Auction, announced in a news release. People magazine reported that Dylan painted the artwork over 50 years ago, approximately in 1968. At the time the pop icon collaborated with The Brand in Woodstock, New York.

He said the ordinance was utilised for shameful political purposes and many innocent people fell victim to it. The NAB Ordinance has been amended, under which the period of remanding accused in the NAB cases has been extended from 14 days to 40 days. Acting President Yusuf Raza Gilani Monday signed two new ordinances, NAB (Amendment) Ordinance 2024 and the Elections Act (Amendment) Ordinance 2024. He signed the ordinances on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, as President Asif Zardari is currently in Dubai. The promulgation came after federal cabinet’s approval of the amendments to the ordinances. Under the amended NAB law, the sentence duration for an officer, convicted for framing cases based on ill will, has been reduced to two years from five years. After the promulgation of the Elections Act (Amendment) Ordinance 2024, the election tribunals will have retired judges as its members, besides the serving jurists.",

A Chicago man convicted of murder a decade ago based in part on testimony from an eyewitness who is legally blind is suing the city and the police department. Darien Harris was convicted by a judge in 2014 in connection with a 2011 fatal shooting at a South Side gas station. He was 12 years into a 76-year prison sentence when he was released in December after The Exoneration Project showed that the eyewitness had advanced glaucoma and lied about his eyesight issues. Harris was 30 years old when he was freed from prison. In April, Harris filed a federal civil rights lawsuit accusing police of fabricating evidence and coercing witnesses into making false statements, according to The Chicago Tribune. He told the newspaper that he is still struggling to put his life back on track. 6 MEN CHARGED WITH STAGING STRING OF CHICAGO-AREA ROBBERIES TO GET IMMIGRATION VISAS Darien Harris, who was convicted of murder a decade ago based in part on testimony from an eyewitness who is legally blind, is suing Chicago and its police department. (Chicago Tribune via Getty Images) \"I don't have any financial help. I'm still (treated like) a felon, so I can't get a good job,\" he said. \"It's hard for me to get into school. I've been so lost. ... I feel like they took a piece of me that is hard for me to get back.\" Harris, an 18-year-old high school senior when he was arrested, was picked out of a police lineup and identified in court by the legally blind eyewitness. The eyewitness testified that he was riding his motorized scooter near the gas station when he heard gunshots and observed a person aiming a handgun, adding that the shooter bumped into him.

He said yes but claimed he did not have vision problems. The eyewitness' doctor determined he was legally blind nine years before the incident, according to court records. A gas station attendant also testified in court that Harris was not the shooter. The Exoneration Project has helped clear more than 200 people since 2009, including a dozen in Cook County, where Chicago is located, in 2023 alone.

        "content": "If you don’t want to buy a new mattress, but you’re looking for a more supportive and luxurious bedtime experience, then a mattress topper could be just the ticket. Memorial Day might now be behind us but some of the best mattress deals deals are still live — but you'll have to act fast. One of our favorite mattress topper deals still live from the weekend is Viscosoft's Select High-Density Mattress Topper, with savings reaching up to $80 off. Choose between a depth of 3\" or $\" inches to make your soft mattress feel firmer. This sale means you can buy a queen size Viscosoft Select High-Density Mattress Topper for just $199.95 (was $269.95) Like some of the best mattresses of 2024 , this topper is made from high-density, gel-infused memory foam, and offers a wide range of benefits. As well as boosting your comfort, it’s designed to promote spinal alignment, relieve pressure points and eliminate motion transfer – all of which should improve your sleep. This Memorial Day mattress sale is due to end any time now, so act fast if you want to save big on this mattress topper. Viscosoft Select High-Density Mattress Topper Was: From $214.95 Now: From $159.95 Saving: Up to $80 Summary: Viscosoft’s the brand behind one of the best mattress toppers of the year (the Viscosoft Active Cooling Mattress Topper). The Select High-Density is another best-selling mattress topper, and is an excellent choice for anyone wishing to improve their sleep without shelling out on a brand-new mattress. Made of high-density memory foam that (according to Viscosoft) weighs twice as much as competitors’ foam, it provides superior comfort and support – especially for people who suffer from back, hip and neck pain. Indeed, it won the Sleep Foundation’s 2024 Best Mattress Topper for Back Pain award. What’s more, this product features a removable, washable cover, enabling you to keep your topper clean and fresh at all times. Price history: Unlike some mattress companies, Viscosoft sale events are usually on the conservative side. It usually takes part – you just might need to visit the Viscosoft website to see what discounts the company is offering, as buyer’s guides often tend to focus on your Emmas and Tempur-Pedics of this world. Will you ever see this mattress topper cheaper than what it’s going for right now? Possibly, although it was the exact same price in February’s Presidents’ Day mattress sales, so this appears to be Viscosoft’s go-to deal at the moment. Benefits: 90-day money back guarantee, free delivery, five-year warranty",

        "description": "The Bear season 3's latest teaser brings the heat ahead of the acclaimed show's return on Hulu and Disney Plus.",
        "content": "Full spoilers follow for The Bear season 2. The Bear season 3 is less than a month away, so it's high time that someone said \"Yes, chef!\" to our request to see some footage from the hit show's next entry. Last Friday (May 24), FX – the studio behind the acclaimed comedy-drama – duly obliged, with the Disney subsidiary delivering a spicy 30-second trailer to tide us over until the show returns. Given its brief runtime, there's not a lot we can glean from The Bear season 3 's latest teaser but, based on the fast-paced clips we see, it'll serve up another tension-filled mix of melodrama and comedy that threatens to boil over at any moment. This isn't the first teaser we've eaten up ahead of The Bear 's third season being released. Over two weeks ago (May 10), FX revealed The Bear season 3's first trailer , albeit it was one that offered no clues about where the story was heading. Instead, it simply showed Carmen 'Carmy' Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White) preparing to cook up another food-based storm at the titular restaurant, which officially opened in the Hulu and Disney Plus show's season 2 finale. The Bear season 3's dual teasers come three months after its June 27 release date – and confirmation that all eight episodes will drop on launch day – was announced. That reveal came three months after The Bear was renewed for a third season . Given the number of plaudits and awards it's received since its June 2022 debut, plus its popularity among general viewers, it was inevitable that one of the best Hulu shows and best Disney Plus shows would re-open its doors to the public. The Bear season 3 might not be the end of the line for the Christopher Storer-developed series, either. First reported by Reel Chicago and later circulated by Deadline , rumors abound that FX has greenlit a fourth installment of the culinary drama, which is apparently being filmed back-to-back with the forthcoming season. An FX spokesperson declined to comment when approached by Variety for confirmation on whether a fourth season was in the offing. It's possible, though, that we'll get an announcement once season 3 has been released on two of the world's best streaming services . Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Regardless, it's a wise move for FX to shoot two seasons of its most popular show – I'm sure Shōgun will argue against that, mind you – simultaneously. Just as Ted Lasso 's cast became sought-after names following the hit Apple TV Plus show's explosion in popularity, some of The Bear 's talented cast have similarly found themselves as some of the hottest prospects in the entertainment industry. Ebon Moss-Bachrach, who some viewers might have also know from Andor , is in line to play The Thing in Marvel 's live-action reboot of The Fantastic Four . Ayo Edebiri voiced April O'Neil in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem , will voice another animated character in Pixar 's Inside Out 2 , and was in line to appear in Marvel's Thunderbolts film before scheduling conflicts scuppered those chances. As for White, he recently starred in A24's The Iron Claw (out now on Max ), Apple's Fingernails movie, and was also coveted by Marvel at one point. With some of The Bear 's most notable names becoming hot commodities in Hollywood circles, it's unclear how their increasingly packed schedules might impact development on future installments of the wildly successful show. Shooting two seasons back-to-back, then, makes sense if some of them will be unavailable for long stretches throughout the rest of 2024. Nobody outside of Storer knows how long The Bear will run for, either, so it's possible that its fourth season could be its last. If it is, at least we'll have been treated to a tasty, four course meal, rather than the increasingly common three-season arc that most series deliver. The Bear season 3 debuts on Hulu (US) and Disney Plus (internationally on June 27.",

        "content": "shared a stunning carousel of family photos this Memorial Day weekend - and the mother-of-four has never looked better. The cookbook author, 38, joined husband and their four kids – Luna, eight, Miles, six, Esti, one, and Wren, 11 months – at their local Natural History Museum for a fun-filled family outing. Proving she's just like the rest of us, Chrissy shared the good and the bad, including an outtake of her tossing her hair over one shoulder, eyes shut, as she prepared to be camera-ready. \"Beautiful, chaotic hour at the natural history museum!,\" she captioned the post. Chrissy looked unbelievable in a pair of high-waisted jeans and a white lace bralet. The tiny top boasted a halterneck cut and was perfectly paired with her flared mom jeans. She slung a suede, fringe-embellished bag over one shoulder, adding a bohemian edge to her look. The photos showed Chrissy and John sharing special family moments with their kids, with their youngest two Esti and Wren – who was born via a surrogate – taking on a starring role. John was every inch the doting dad in the sweet snaps, which saw him carrying little Wren on his shoulders as they toured the museum and grounds. The couple raise their four kids in their Beverly Hills home. The spacious, 10,700 square foot property, features six bedrooms and nine bathrooms, offering ample space for their whole family. The outdoor area is equally impressive and boasts a 100-foot saltwater infinity pool with panoramic views of the city. John and Chrissy's fans were surprised when the couple last year, just months after Chrissy had . While Chrissy was pregnant with their daughter Esti, Wren was born via surrogate to a woman named Alexandra. Describing the unique experience, the video model said: \"We ate hot pot to celebrate, watched Vanderpump Rules with our growing bellies, our families blending into one for the past year. \"Just minutes before midnight on June 19th, I got to witness the most beautiful woman, my friend, our surrogate, give birth amidst a bit of chaos, but with strength and pure joy and love.\" The kids aren't far off developmentally as a result; it won't be long until Wren joins his sister Esti at daycare, a milestone the family celebrated this month.",

        "description": "Orlando Pirates are set to reward their prolific striker, Tshegofatso Mabasa with a new contract extension and a significantly high buyout clause, the Siya crew investigates.",
        "content": "Following , the latest development comes after the striker's outstanding performance as the season's top goal scorer, where he netted a total of 16 goals. The sources have added that the new contract may include a significant R50 million buyout clause, which will apply to both local and international clubs interested in acquiring Mabasa's services. This clause is indicative of Mabasa's high value to the team and is seen as a protective measure to ensure that the club is adequately compensated should he be sought after by other teams, considering his incredible form in recent months. \"All the parties involved are happy about the upcoming new deal. Yes, it's of course an improved contract because the player has proven himself that he could be the best striker in the league and that warrants an improved contract,\" said the Siya source. \"It's not yet 100% done but the club has exercised that option which they had of keeping him for another two seasons as his contract ends in June 30 this year. But now it means he won't be going anywhere. The team exercised the two-year option plus the new two-year contract which means it runs until June 2028,\" the source told Soccer Laduma. Mabasa's goalscoring prowess is undisputed, as he is the reigning DStv Premiership top goal scorer. He demonstrated his talent by scoring six goals in 13 appearances for Moroka Swallows at the start of the season until December, and after returning from his loan spell, he added another 10 goals, this time in 13 games for Pirates. A second Siya source also discussed Mabasa's buyout clause and contract at Pirates. \"It's not just an improved contract but also with a buyout clause of R50 million. That means whichever team wants him have to meet Pirates' demands, they won't let him go for cheap. He is the best striker currently and with interest from local teams as well as Europe it's only fair to have that buy out clause,\" the second source stated. The Siya crew contacted Pirates for comment but the club had not responded by the time this story was published. You must be to read and post comments.",

        "content": "The Scottish Police ­Federation and the Law Enforcement Action ­Partnership (LEAP) are calling for measures to remove firearms from circulation and make the streets safer. They say new technology, the dark web, the threat of terrorism and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine mean illegal weapons remain a danger to communities. It comes after two guns produced by 3D printers were recorded by police in Scotland for the first time in the middle of last year. Scottish Police Federation chairman David Threadgold, 49, believes an amnesty – also covering blades such as swords and knives – could make neighbourhoods across the country safer. He said: “There are people that will take a legally held firearm and use it for criminal activity. Experts warn the guns are cheap and easy to produce although unlikely to be an increased risk to the public. “We have got to get that balance right, of course, and the impact on the police is that they do not potentially have to deal with that type of crime. “The impact on the police and community could be significant. “If everything else is in place, bearing in mind that the SPF is the voice of every police officer in Scotland, I don’t think you would have a single cop who would not advocate against potentially making our community safer.” There were almost 20,000 offensive weapon crimes recorded by police in Scotland between 2021 and 2023, data revealed. Any country-wide amnesty would need the approval of the Crown Office and Police Scotland. David Kennedy, general secretary of the group, said that if weapons are not taken off the streets the way Police Scotland operate could change significantly. He said: “If we don’t get guns off the streets the reality is that we are moving closer to police officers in Scotland carrying firearms.” Get all the latest news from around the country Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country",

'It is a challenge and we must not get this wrong,' French transport minister Patrice Vergriete told aviation executives, warning 'serious operational problems' could create queues of tourists at airports and lead to the 'disruption' of public order. Mr Vergriete said last week preparations for the summer Olympics in Paris were still taking priority, despite alerting the interior minister to concerns. 'We have little visibility and are doubtful about police numbers and technology,' he lamented. From October, British and non-EU passport holders will have to go through fingerprint checks and face scans under the new EU Entry/Exit System (EES). The system will check each passenger's name and biometric data when they enter an EU country. It will replace the stamping of passports, which began after Brexit when the UK became a 'third country' to the bloc – meaning it is not a member state and does not have the right to free movement within the EU. French transport minister Patrice Vergriete (pictured) said he was 'worried' about the new automated border measures which are set to come into force from October British and non-EU passport holders will have to go through fingerprint checks and face scans under the new EU Entry/Exit System (EES). (File photo) 'I cannot say that we are not working hard to ensure that we are as operational as possible,' he told the French National Federation of Aviation and its Trades (FNAM) conference. 'I cannot say that collaboration with the Ministry of the Interior is going badly, that would be lying... but I fear problems.' The transport minister said he had asked the EU for a delay to the new system being rolled out but he fears this is unlikely. It had been scheduled to come into force before the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, but this has since been delayed. 'I'm even going to ask for a further postponement, but it seems difficult to me to get it from the European authorities,' Mr Vergriete added. 'We will do our utmost to be on time, and we are all aware that things are not going to run totally smoothly'. Mr Vergriete is not the first minister to raise concerns over the new e-gate system. Lord Cameron, James Cleverly and Mark Harper have all raised concerns about the new system with French ministers, noting that the changes could lead to travel chaos, the Telegraph previously reported. Queues at the Port of Dover - one of the locations where the new border checks will be in place People queue for Eurostar train services at St Pancras International station as they make their Easter getaway in London, Britain, 29 March 2024 Each time visitors try to cross into the continent, they will have to show a facial image and provide four fingerprints One senior Government source familiar with the discussions on the new checks told the newspaper: 'The main risk is that we are in the hands of the French in those places where there is going to be disruption on UK soil.' Lord Cameron previously said he was 'really worried' about delays and said the technology 'still needs testing and improving' as he pointed to 'choke points' at Dover and St Pancras. Airlines are set to be concerned that tourists will face severe delays in both departures and arrivals. Meanwhile Eurotunnel estimate that the average time of processing a car at Dover will rise from less than a minute to up to seven minutes - partially because visitors will not be able to have their passports checked at windows and will instead need to exit vehicles and use the e-gates.

While reviews for the game have generally been positive, like any new game, there have been complaints. While the slow weapon progression is probably the most frustrating issue right now, if you've been playing XDefiant, the odds are pretty high that you've been demolished by a sniper rifle.

Getting sniped at close range isn't fun.

Zero flinch or movement punishment. The sniper lobbies make the game unfun.\"This sentiment was echoed by many, with Snooperal saying their \"only gripe with snipers is the fact that they're better shotguns than shotguns,\" while More_Tackle9491 said they \"would do anything for a no sniping lobby,\" as it's \"impossible to compete.\"As for what's causing the issue, the majority of players agree that the lack of flinch on sniper rifles is problematic. Flinch makes your recoil increase when you're being shot, but as snipers don't have it, you can shoot them while they are scoped in and their aim isn't affected. \"They 100% need more flinch.

It's a clear design flaw.\"There's definitely room for snipers in XDefiant, but the fact that they are more potent at short-range than an SMG like the P90 is problematic.

        "content": "BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Spain and Norway moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure on Tel Aviv to soften its devastating response to last year's Hamas-led attack. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the Spanish Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state at its Tuesday morning meeting. “This is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,” Sánchez, standing at the gates of the prime minister's palace in Madrid, said during a televised speech. Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz lashed out at Spain on X, saying Sánchez's government was “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes.” Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in a statement that “for more than 30 years, Norway has been one of the strongest advocates for a Palestinian state. Today, when Norway officially recognizes Palestine as a state, is a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.” While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so. Still, the adherence of three European countries to the group represents a victory for Palestinian efforts in the world of public opinion. Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain , with Madrid insisting that the EU should take measures against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. After Monday’s meeting of EU foreign ministers, Irish Foreign Minister Micheál Martin said “for the first time at an EU meeting, in a real way, I have seen a significant discussion on sanctions” for Israel. Norway, which is not an EU member but often aligns its foreign policy with the bloc, handed diplomatic papers to the Palestinian government over the weekend ahead of its formal recognition. At the same time, the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his weight behind the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including leaders of the Hamas militant group. The formal declaration and resulting diplomatic dispute come over seven months into a grinding war waged by Israel against Hamas in Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. Israel’s air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry , which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Last week's joint announcement by Spain, Ireland and Norway triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries’ ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and abductions. Some 140 countries — more than two-thirds of the United Nations — recognize a Palestinian state. The addition of three western European countries to that group will likely put pressure on EU heavyweights France and Germany to think hard about their continued refusal to follow suit. The United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu’s government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations. In his speech on Tuesday, Sánchez said that the recognition of a Palestinian state was “a decision that we do not adopt against anyone, least of all against Israel, a friendly people whom we respect, whom we appreciate and with whom we want to have the best possible relationship.” The Socialist leader, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza. He called for a permanent cease-fire, for stepping up humanitarian aid into Gaza and for the release of hostages that Hamas has held since the Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel’s response. Sánchez said that the move was to back the beleaguered Palestinian Authority, which lost effective political control of Gaza to Hamas. He laid out his vision for a state ruled by the Palestinian Authority that must connect the West Bank and Gaza via a corridor with east Jerusalem as its capital. Norway's Barth Eide added that “the recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries.” The Western-backed Palestinian Authority administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, cooperates with Israel on security matters and favors a negotiated two-state solution. Its forces were driven out of Gaza by Hamas when the militants seized power there in 2007. The Palestinians have long sought an independent state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. The idea of a land corridor linking Gaza and the West Bank through Israel was discussed in previous rounds of peace talks, but no serious or substantive peace negotiations have been held in over 15 years. “We will not recognize changes in the 1967 border lines other than those agreed to by the parties,” Sánchez added. “Furthermore, this decision reflects our absolute rejection of Hamas, a terrorist organization who is against the two-state solution,” Sánchez said. “From the outset, Spain has strongly condemned the terrorist attacks of Oct. 7. This clear condemnation is the resounding expression of our steadfast commitment in the fight against terrorism. I would like to underline that starting tomorrow we would focus all our efforts to implement the two state solution and make it a reality.” Israel is also under pressure from the International Criminal Court after its chief prosecutor said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The ICJ is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied . Associated Press writers Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel and Jan M. Olsen in Copenhagen, Denmark and Raf Casert in Brussels contributed to this report. Follow AP's Israel-Hamas coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war",

        "content": "BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Spain and Norway moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure on Tel Aviv to soften its devastating response to last year's Hamas-led attack. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the Spanish Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state at its Tuesday morning meeting. “This is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,” Sánchez, standing at the gates of the prime minister's palace in Madrid, said during a televised speech. Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz lashed out at Spain on X, saying Sánchez's government was “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes.” Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in a statement that “for more than 30 years, Norway has been one of the strongest advocates for a Palestinian state. Today, when Norway officially recognizes Palestine as a state, is a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.” While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so. Still, the adherence of three European countries to the group represents a victory for Palestinian efforts in the world of public opinion. Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain , with Madrid insisting that the EU should take measures against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. After Monday’s meeting of EU foreign ministers, Irish Foreign Minister Micheál Martin said “for the first time at an EU meeting, in a real way, I have seen a significant discussion on sanctions” for Israel. Norway, which is not an EU member but often aligns its foreign policy with the bloc, handed diplomatic papers to the Palestinian government over the weekend ahead of its formal recognition. At the same time, the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his weight behind the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including leaders of the Hamas militant group. The formal declaration and resulting diplomatic dispute come over seven months into a grinding war waged by Israel against Hamas in Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. Israel’s air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry , which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Last week's joint announcement by Spain, Ireland and Norway triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries’ ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and abductions. Some 140 countries — more than two-thirds of the United Nations — recognize a Palestinian state. The addition of three western European countries to that group will likely put pressure on EU heavyweights France and Germany to think hard about their continued refusal to follow suit. The United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu’s government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations. In his speech on Tuesday, Sánchez said that the recognition of a Palestinian state was “a decision that we do not adopt against anyone, least of all against Israel, a friendly people whom we respect, whom we appreciate and with whom we want to have the best possible relationship.” The Socialist leader, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza. He called for a permanent cease-fire, for stepping up humanitarian aid into Gaza and for the release of hostages that Hamas has held since the Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel’s response. Sánchez said that the move was to back the beleaguered Palestinian Authority, which lost effective political control of Gaza to Hamas. He laid out his vision for a state ruled by the Palestinian Authority that must connect the West Bank and Gaza via a corridor with east Jerusalem as its capital. Norway's Barth Eide added that “the recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries.” The Western-backed Palestinian Authority administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, cooperates with Israel on security matters and favors a negotiated two-state solution. Its forces were driven out of Gaza by Hamas when the militants seized power there in 2007. The Palestinians have long sought an independent state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. The idea of a land corridor linking Gaza and the West Bank through Israel was discussed in previous rounds of peace talks, but no serious or substantive peace negotiations have been held in over 15 years. “We will not recognize changes in the 1967 border lines other than those agreed to by the parties,” Sánchez added. “Furthermore, this decision reflects our absolute rejection of Hamas, a terrorist organization who is against the two-state solution,” Sánchez said. “From the outset, Spain has strongly condemned the terrorist attacks of Oct. 7. This clear condemnation is the resounding expression of our steadfast commitment in the fight against terrorism. I would like to underline that starting tomorrow we would focus all our efforts to implement the two state solution and make it a reality.” Israel is also under pressure from the International Criminal Court after its chief prosecutor said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The ICJ is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied . Associated Press writers Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel and Jan M. Olsen in Copenhagen, Denmark and Raf Casert in Brussels contributed to this report. Follow AP's Israel-Hamas coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war",

        "content": "In a significant development, contract negotiations between the governments of India and France in the over Rs 50,000 crore deal for 26 Rafale Marine fighter jets is scheduled to begin on May 30 with the arrival of a high-level French team here. The French side would meet with Indian Defence Ministry counterparts to begin official negotiations in the fighter jet deal for the Indian Navy under which aircraft would be operated from both aircraft carriers operated by the force, defence industry officials told ANI. The French team will include officials from their defence ministry and industry including original equipment manufacturers Dassault Aviation and Thales, the officials said. The Indian side would include members from the defence acquisition wing and the Indian Navy. Sources in the government said that they would try to complete negotiations with France and sign the agreement by the end of this financial year. France had submitted its response to India’s tender for buying 26 Rafale Marine jets for the Indian Navy’s aircraft carriers – INS Vikrant and INS Vikramaditya in December itself. The response to India’s Letter of Acceptance had been submitted by France in New Delhi. The Indian side has carried out a detailed study of the French bid for the Indian deal including the commercial offer or price for the aircraft, along with other details of the contract, they said. India will now go in for tough negotiations in the deal with French government officials, as it is a government-to-government contract. The Navy Chief has directed his team to ensure that the timeframe required for the project is squeezed significantly to ensure early finalisation and induction of the planes in the inventory.",

        "description": "As Nigeria joins the rest of the World to mark this year’s International Children’s Day, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and the Children of Africa Leadership and Values Development",
        "content": "As Nigeria joins the rest of the World to mark this year’s International Children’s Day, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and the Children of Africa Leadership and Values Development Initiative(CALDEV) have expressed willingness to work together to ensure that the rights of Nigerian children are adequately protected. The two organisations made this known when a delegation of CALDEV officials and school children paid a courtesy visit to the headquarters of NHRC on Monday in Abuja. Hon. Bamidele Salam, Founder and President of CALDEV, who led the delegation, said the visit was part of stakeholder’s engagement to rally support for the rights of Nigerian children as they mark the International Children’s Day. According to Salam, who represents Ede North,South/Egbedero/Ejigbo Federal Constituency of Osun State at the Federal House of Representatives, there is a gap on issues affecting children in Nigeria in spite of the Child Rights Act. “One of those gaps is the one that has to do with children’s rights to education, and it is sad that in the whole world, Nigeria has the highest number of out-of-school children today, according to UNICEF, about 17.5 million children do not have access to education. “Children in Nigeria that are involved in forced labor are over 15 million, according to the last statistics also by the UNICEF, and Children have been victims of violence in their homes, violence in schools, violence even in religious places, violence in several spaces, because there are inadequate measures to protect them from abuse, sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional trauma that children face. “These are just some of the issues that affect the Nigerian child, and I believe that an occasion like this should be used to drum up the awareness and ask for the intervention of government at all levels on addressing these problems. “So we are here today to further extend to you our hand of collaboration and readiness to work together with the National Human Rights Commission for the purpose of protecting the rights of Nigerian children, advancing their cause, and progressively removing Nigeria from this very odious record which we have obtained everywhere in the world. “Together we can raise awareness and initiate measures that will ensure that there are consequences for those who abuse the rights of children, because where there are no consequences, impunity is bound to continue,” he said. The CALDEV helmsman added that “If a child wants to take a legal action, he needs a guardian, through which he can take some legal action against those who infringe on his or her rights. “This is where we believe that the National Human Rights Commission should come in to ensure that we protect children and give them a very open space to air their views and to lodge complaints about those abuses that they suffer and those rights which are denied them”,he said. While presenting a formal proposal for a collaborative partnership with NHRC to the Executive Secretary, Salam said,” We are going to work together to ensure that Nigeria provides a very brighter future, a very guaranteed future for our youthful population.” In his remarks, Mr Tony Ojukwu, Executive Secretary/CEO of NHRC commended CALDEV for the initiative and expressed his goodwill to Nigerian Children on the celebration of their day. Ojukwu who was represented by Mr Harry Obe, Director in the Department of Economic,Social and Cultural Rights of NHR, said the commission had a department that was dedicated to issues of children and women. He therefore expressed the commission’s readiness to collaborate with CALDEV in protecting the rights of the Nigerian child. “We all agree that in our present-day generation and the circumstances that surround the world now, there is need for all of us to join hands and pay attention to value re-orientation, development of children, particularly if we must actually ensure that the world is preserved and that the value system that our fathers handed over to us is actually taken forward and better developed for the good of humanity. “The fact that children are vulnerable is not in doubt because of their age and circumstances they find themselves, they are subject to control and possible manipulation by older members of the society. “So there must be a dedicated effort like you have shown and then institutions like the NHRC must work with you to ensure that the children are protected from possible violations or abuses. “Our law envisages that we partner with civil society organisations, and for a civil society organisation that is focusing on a particular area that is within our mandate, we will work with you,” he said. Obe added that, “What we need to do is to, after now, set up a committee that will work together to draw the memorandum of understanding that will be signed between the organisation and the commission to ensure that we further protect and drive the objectives of the organisation.”",

        "content": "Oppo Find X7 Ultra has been awarded the Eye Comfort Display Label and Gold Display Label from DXOMARK. It is the first smartphone to receive the Eye Comfort Display Label, meeting stringent requirements for flicker, brightness, blue light limitation, and color consistency. Oppo Find X7 Ultra has earned both the Eye Comfort Display Label and the Gold Display Label from DXOMARK. The Eye Comfort Display Label is awarded to screens that meet four requirements set by DXOMARK, which takes into account the flicker, minimum brightness achievable, limited blue light, and colour consistency. Notably, the Find X7 Ultra is the first smartphone to receive the Eye Comfort Display Label. Thibault Cabana, DXOMARK’s Display Evaluation Director, highlighted the device’s Bedtime Mode, which efficiently adjusts blue-light filtering based on the time of day. Cabana noted that the device’s circadian action factor, which measures how much artificial lighting disrupts human sleep cycles, reached 0.63, below DXOMARK’s recommended maximum of 0.65. DXOMARK: Eye Comfort Display Label requirement 1) The first requirement is to limit noticeable screen flicker. DXOMARK says the chance of detecting flicker should be below 50% in default or anti-flicker mode. The OPPO Find X7 Ultra has a flicker detection probability of just 10 per cent. 2) For comfortable use in dark environments, DXOMARK sets a minimum brightness of 2 nits. The OPPO Find X7 Ultra can go as low as 1.57 nits, reducing harsh light and making it easier on the eyes, especially in bed. 3) DXOMARK also limits blue light, requiring a circadian action factor of less than 0.65 to reduce sleep disruption. The Find X7 Ultra has a circadian action factor of 0.63, minimizing blue light’s impact on sleep. 4) Lastly, DXOMARK requires at least 95 per cent colour consistency when the blue light filter is on, using the P3 colour space. The Find X7 Ultra achieves 99 per cent colour consistency, maintaining high quality and eye comfort. Oppo Find X7 Ultra: Display features The Oppo Find X7 Ultra features a QHD+ resolution of 3168 x 1440 pixels with a density of 510 pixels per inch. The LTPO AMOLED panel supports a refresh rate of 1-120 Hz, for a wide range of smoothness. It has an overall peak brightness of 1,600 nits and a local peak brightness of 4,500 nits. The Find X7 Ultra supports ProXDR for high dynamic range photos and is compatible with Google’s Ultra HDR standard. It also supports Dolby Vision, HDR10, HDR10+, and HLG for high dynamic range video. The X7 Ultra display also comes with O-Sync 3.0 for “ultra-low touch latency”, which works even when wet to prevent accidental touches in the rain or when you have wet hands.",

But how does the Australian star keep looking so young at 56? We can't quite believe her age either! However, Minogue has shared her simple skin secrets, beauty rules and exercise regime that have kept her looking far younger than her years. During a TV interview on ITV's Lorraine back in 2018, the star joked that she needed a lot of help to look that good. function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) She said: \"It takes a team [to look like this], I can tell you.

I always take my makeup off; I've been wearing makeup for work for a long, long time. \"A good dermatologist, if you've got time to go, and have some treatments.\" Meanwhile, she added that she is a big believer in celebrating birthdays at every age.

Read our Privacy Policy The singer said that's what her fourteenth studio album and 2018 release Golden was about. \"There's a line in the song Golden – 'We're not young, we're not old, we're golden' – it was the only line I wanted to put somewhere in a song on the album, meaning you can't make yourself younger, you can't make yourself older, you are only you, who you are in that moment. \"It could be a great moment in your life; it could be a really crappy moment in your life. \"That's just where you are. Try to shine whatever time it is whether it's a dark time or a bright time.\" However, when it comes to exercise and working out, Minogue isn't a fan. Trending The star previously admitted that she \"hardly ever works out\" but is \"always on the go\". And we can see why Minogue is constantly on the go in the past 12 months, the singer was named Global Icon at the Brit Awards and completed a six-month Las Vegas residency. Meanwhile, she is set to headline the British Summertime Festival in London’s Hyde Park in July as well as the Sziget Festival in Budapest this August. Speaking in an unearthed interview with the Express, she revealed: “I don’t really work out, but I’m constantly on the go”. Despite, going to a Pilates session now and then, her attitude to working out has changed. She recalled: “I loved aerobics and I used to do callanetics. “I would travel everywhere with this home workout on a VHS tape and put it on in hotel rooms.” Despite the singer not being on a strict diet she instead goes for more healthier choices when it comes to eating. Minogue began a low-glycemic index (low-GI) diet several years ago. This is where the foods you eat can affect blood sugar levels and includes items such as nuts, seeds, wholegrains, lentils and beans. These foods release energy more slowly so you'll feel fuller for longer.

        "content": "SINGAPORE , May 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- SingHaiyi is poised to deliver yet another quality lifestyle residential concept at the Jurong Lake District as it partners Nakano Singapore (Nakano), a contractor renowned for delivering quality projects in Singapore for nearly 50 years, for Sora. Nestled within the Jurong Lake District, the largest mixed-use business district outside the city centre, Sora promises to be a luxurious development offering tranquillity, convenience and comfort at a high quality. \"Aligned with the Jurong Lake District's transformation to become an integrated hub for live-work-play-learn, our aim is for Sora to offer its owners a premium lifestyle with a fine balance between nature and recreation. SingHaiyi's commitment to homeowners transcends design and lifestyle to quality and peace of mind. Hence, it was a natural fit with Nakano, known for its consistency in delivering exceptional quality in their works. We look forward to leveraging their expertise to bring out the best in Sora,\" said Mr Raymond Chia , Group Chief Executive Officer of SingHaiyi. Emphasis on outstanding work despite challenges During the COVID19 pandemic, the construction market was adversely affected by steeply rising costs and unpredictable supply chain disruptions, making it challenging for contractors to make new time and cost commitments for project delivery. During this period, Nakano had adopted a cautious approach and focused on completing projects that were committed to their clients before the pandemic hit. Despite these unfavourable circumstances, Nakano remained deeply committed to delivering impeccable quality, and successfully delivered prestigious projects such as the Artyzen Singapore Hotel along Cuscaden Road and the One North Eden condominium at one-north gateway, which remain the talk of the t own. \"Once we saw some normalcy returning and the market turbulence easing in 2023, we re-engaged the built environment market boldly and explored various opportunities, including placing more emphasis on residential projects, which is our forte. We take pride in being one of the few Japanese contractors in Singapore who have delivered residential projects consistently over the decades, among our diverse range of project types, and are therefore thrilled to collaborate with SingHaiyi for the Sora project as we find great synergy with them in our ethos to create high quality developments for our clients and consumers. We look forward to a fruitful journey as we deliver 440 beautiful homes for the Sora residents,\" said Mr Kutsuzawa Yoichi, Managing Director of Nakano Singapore. Located along Yuan Ching Road, Sora will be developed at the former Park View Mansions site. The ground-breaking ceremony was held on 29 April 2024 . Sora Gallery is located at Prinsep Street and will officially be open to the public from 22 June 2024. Photos of Nakano's earlier projects:",

        "content": "Frankfurt : The number of people granted German citizenship reached the highest level last year since records began in 2000. The number of naturalisations rose by 19 per cent compared to the previous year, having already risen by 28 per cent in 2022, the Federal Statistical Office reported on Tuesday. In absolute figures, around 2,00,100 people were naturalised in 2023. People from 157 different nationalities were granted German citizenship in 2023, the most common being Syria, Turkey, Iraq, Romania and Afghanistan. Together, these countries accounted for more than half of all naturalisations. Naturalised citizens were 29.3-years-old on average and, therefore, significantly younger than the population as a whole. At 45 per cent, the proportion of women was lower than in the population as a whole. Former Syrian nationals made up the largest group of naturalised citizens, accounting for more than a third of all naturalisations. Their number increased by a further 56 per cent compared to the previous year. In 2022, this figure had already more than doubled compared to the previous year and even increased sevenfold in 2021. \"The high number of naturalisations of Syrians is therefore related to the high immigration of Syrian asylum seekers in the years 2014 to 2016, who now increasingly meet the requirements for naturalisation,\" the office reported. The number of naturalisations of Ukrainians rose by six per cent to 5,900 in 2023 after almost tripling from 1,900 to 5,600 from 2021 to 2022. Naturalisations of Ukrainian citizens accounted for three per cent of all naturalisations in 2023.",

        "content": "Belgium have recalled Axel Witsel to the squad for Euro 2024 in Germany next month but there is no place for Thibaut Courtois despite the Real Madrid goalkeeper being in line to feature in Saturday's Champions League final. Coach Domenico Tedesco announced his 25-man squad on Tuesday for next month's tournament with Witsel's recall a major surprise. The 35-year-old announced his international retirement last year and his return comes after Tedesco visited the Atletico Madrid defender to persuade him to come back to the team. Witsel won the last of his 130 caps at the World Cup in Qatar, where Belgium were eliminated in the group stage. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Courtois walked out on the Belgian squad last June when he was not named captain following Eden Hazard's retirement, leading to a public falling out with Tedesco. The Real Madrid goalkeeper was criticised by teammates and has since expressed regret, but the rift between him and the coach appears not to have healed. Soon after the walkout, Courtois suffered a serious knee injury that sidelined him for most of the season, returning for Real Madrid only earlier this month and being in the squad for Saturday's final against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley. \"Courtois was very clear and honest and early in his communication. The latest information we received is that he is not ready for the European Championships. He knows his body best,\" said Tedesco at a press conference on Tuesday. \"I have had Axel in my mind for a long time, even during the qualification. It's about quality, Witsel offers a lot of quality. \"He is a key player at Atletico Madrid. I met him, wanted to see him, look into his eyes. We need him, he has experience and can help the young players. Experience in that position is important. We are playing a European Championship, that is no small thing,\" the coach added. Club Brugge fullback Maxim De Cuyper is the only uncapped player in the squad. \"I have been following Maxim De Cuyper for a long time but never had the chance to select him before, but he now deserves to be in the squad,\" said Tedesco, who picked 25 players instead of the 26 that UEFA are allowing for each squad. Belgium's most capped international Jan Vertonghen competes at the age of 37 and with 154 caps. The squad also includes top scorer Romelu Lukaku, who has netted 83 times in 114 appearances for his country.

Contact Stephen.Gibbs@mailonline.com By Stephen Gibbs for Daily Mail Australia Published: 10:16, 28 May 2024 | Updated: 10:27, 28 May 2024 e-mail 2 View comments EXCLUSIVE Legions of Parramatta Eels fans might nostalgically recall James Hardie as the NRL club's major sponsor during its most successful football era in the 1980s. But for many thousands of Australians, the name of the company that for 70 years manufactured lethal asbestos products represents 'corporate bastardry'. Parramatta announced last Thursday that James Hardie would return to the front of its team jerseys as major sponsor next season for the first time in three decades. The club's previous association with the building materials producer ran from 1981 to 1995 and included first grade premierships in 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1986. The new four-year partnership between the Eels and James Hardie is meant to rekindle memories of Ray Price, Mick Cronin and Peter Sterling during the club's glory days. Parramatta has signed a four-year deal with James Hardie Industries which will put the building material manufacturer back on the front of its jerseys. Ray Price (centre) and Mick Cronin are pictured with then prime minister Bob Hawke after winning the 1986 grand final James Hardie was Australia's largest manufacturer of materials containing asbestos which causes fatal lung diseases including mesothelioma. A social media user has superimposed the face of asbestos disease victim's campaigner Bernie Banton onto a Parramatta jumper Other old Parramatta greats were hauled out to hail the deal as a major boon for the people of greater western Sydney . 'It's fantastic,' said Steve Edge, who captained the Eels to three consecutive grand final victories. 'We were a James Hardie family in the old days and it was just terrific. 'You'd win a comp and the James Hardie truck would be at the leagues club... It just meant so much to the community.' For Barry Robson, president of the Asbestos Diseases Foundation of Australia, seeing Parramatta join forces once more with James Hardie is devastating. 'It's bloody disgraceful,' Mr Robson told Daily Mail Australia. 'People are just shaking their heads. They're just up in arms about it. 'The strangest thing is that Parramatta club members have been victims of Hardie's products - that's the bloody irony of it. 'They've killed some of their bloody supporters.' Parramatta's previous association with James Hardie ran from 1981 to 1995 and included first-grade premierships in 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1986. The 1986 premiership team is pictured Since last week's announcement, Mr Robson has been inundated with calls and social media messages from victims of James Hardie products and their families. 'There's 4,000 Australians die each year from asbestos-related disease,' he said. 'Seeing it coming back, seeing James Hardie on the footballers' jumpers again, it's just a trigger that brings back bad memories. 'I fought these bastards for ten years, ten long bloody years. This company, it's the worst example of corporate bastardry.' The decision to welcome James Hardie back to Parramatta has been met with mixed reactions by supporters on social media. 'Now I will have a real reason to buy a new jersey!' one user wrote on the club's X account, with others saying 'Loving the nostalgia!' and 'Lets hope it lifts the curse off Parra and restore the 80s glory'. Parramatta announced last Thursday that James Hardie would return to the front of its team jerseys next season for the first time in three decades (pictured) Those comments were countered by posts such as, 'Was there not a company that kills puppies you could find to sponsor us?', 'Didn't 1000s die of asbestosis because of them?' and 'A breath fresh air. Asbest as it gets'. From the 1950s, James Hardie was Australia's largest manufacturer and distributor of building products, insulation, pipes and brake linings containing asbestos. For decades it was known exposure to asbestos fibres could cause mesothelioma and lung cancer as well as asbestosis and other lung diseases. James Hardie ceased all production of asbestos products in 1987 but continued to resist recognising it was responsible for compensating victims. The company finally acknowledged its liability for asbestos-related disease among its workers in 2001 by establishing a compensation fund with a one-off contribution of $293million. When that fund ran out in 2003, the company - which had moved offshore - refused to provide more money to victims. A public campaign against James Hardie resulted in then NSW premier Bob Carr ordering a judicial inquiry which in 2004 began assessing how much compensation would be needed. Among the social media responses to Parramatta's sponsorship deal with James Hardie was this comment: 'Was there not a company that kills puppies you could find to sponsor us?' That inquiry heard James Hardie had set up a holding company in The Netherlands and severed ties with Australian subsidiaries which had asbestos liabilities. Momentum shifted after father-of-five Bernie Banton, who was diagnosed with asbestosis in 1999, became the public face of the fight against the company. Mr Banton had been a lathe operator working with asbestos from 1968 to 1974 in a James Hardie plant near Parramatta at Camelia. He became known for his television appearances with an oxygen tank by his side and tubes running into his nose as he spoke passionately in front of the cameras. The inquiry found James Hardie had grossly underestimated its future liabilities to asbestos victims which could total $2.2billion. An agreement was reached in 2007 which required James Hardie to make annual contributions to the Asbestos Injuries Compensation Fund, subject to a cap of 35 per cent of its cashflow. That arrangement, which was estimated to result in total payments of $4.5billion over 40 years, continues. The late Bernie Banton, who worked for James Hardie from 1968 to 1974, became the public face of the fight for compensation against the company. Mr Banton is pictured with wife Karen Mr Robson said the country's second-largest producer of asbestos products, CSR, had acted honourably and stuck to handshake deal on compensation payments made the same year. 'Hardies are going back to the 1980s all right,' he said. 'They pulled the same PR stunt back then when they knew that all these claims were coming. 'They're at it again and we're still having problems with Hardies paying victims.' James Hardie Industries now has its headquarters in Dublin and is listed on both the Australian and New York stock exchanges with its management team in Chicago. Earlier this month it announced record annual sales of $5.85billion and a record adjusted net income of about $1billion. Parramatta CEO Jim Sarantinos told Daily Mail Australia that the club had done its due diligence before entering into the deal with James Hardie. 'We gave careful consideration to the legacy health issues associated with certain James Hardie building products historically,' Mr Sarantinos said. 'This included extensive discussions with the current James Hardie executive team to understand the company's acknowledgement of those historical issues and their commitment to doing the right thing.' That commitment extended to funding all compensation claims as well as asbestos education and medical research, and 'making a positive impact on the Parramatta and broader Western Sydney community into the future'. James Hardie was Australia's largest manufacturer and distributor of building products, insulation, pipes and brake linings containing asbestos. Eels legend Ray Price is pictured Adele Gordon, James Hardie's local head of marketing, said the company needed to remain a 'healthy and thriving business' to continue funding compensation claims. 'We recognise and acknowledge our history, part of which includes the use of asbestos in the building materials products manufactured by James Hardie's former subsidiaries until the mid-1980s,' Ms Gordon said. 'The use of asbestos in the manufacture of James Hardie products ceased in the mid-1980s and James Hardie products continue to be asbestos-free. 'We are committed to do the right thing and have paid approximately $2.2billion to fund compensation payments and asbestos education and medical research. 'To the best of our understanding, no proven compensation claim against James Hardie (or its former subsidiaries) has gone unpaid.' Australians including home renovators continue to be diagnosed with lung diseases after relatively recent exposure to James Hardie products which contained asbestos. Five years ago, an Adelaide father-of-three with terminal cancer was awarded $3,077,187 - the largest compensation payment to an asbestos victim in Australia. Parramatta CEO Jim Sarantinos said before entering into the deal with James Hardie the club had done its due diligence. Mr Sarantinos (left) is pictured with James Hardie CEO Aaron Erter Matthew Werfel received the record amount after James Hardie was found to have failed to warn the public about ongoing risks posed by their former products. Mr Werfel had first been exposed to asbestos dust while working for a fencing contractor as a teenager and then later while renovating his home in the mid 2000s. He was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2017 and sued James Hardie subsidiary Amaca in the South Australian Supreme Court. Read More EXCLUSIVE Westfield Bondi Junction: Rebel pulls Kangaroos jerseys from sale after Joel Cauchi killed six in stabbing spree Judge Leonie Farrell found 'there can be no doubt' that by the time Mr Werfel was exposed to asbestos Amaca knew the risks presented to renovators by its building products. 'Amaca breached its duty of care to a large class of Australians, of which Mr Werfel was a member,' Judge Farrell said a scathing August 2019 judgement. 'The magnitude of the risk of members of this class contracting mesothelioma was vast. The consequences of the risk were the deaths of many Australians. The probability of the risk occurring was certain.' James Hardie appealed against that decision and had Mr Werfel's compensation reduced to $2.23million. It then unsuccessfully sought leave to appeal again to the High Court. Mr Banton was made a Member of the Order of Australia for his services as an advocate for asbestos victims in 2005. He was diagnosed with peritoneal mesothelioma in August 2007 and died aged 61 two months later, a year after he had been given the keys to Parramatta City.

Lisa then used a mirror and a dog cage to capture Penny, before taking her to the Pleasley-based centre. The founder of the Beauty’s Legacy said that her experience with animals such as horses, dogs, and cats had helped her catch Penny, even though working with birds was new for her.

        "content": "Girls Aloud’s huge arena tour across the UK and Ireland , which hits 12 cities in 30 days, is coming to Sheffield tonight (May 28). Along with the pop bangers that fans know and love, concert-goers tonight should expect some intense and emotional moments, too. Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with a Digital Subscription to The Star, you can get unlimited access to the website including our premium content, as well as benefiting from fewer ads, loyalty rewards and much more. Tributes to band member Sarah Harding, who passed away from breast cancer in 2021, aged 39, have been scattered throughout the shows. Her distinctive vocals singing words from The Promise, ‘here I am, walking Primrose , wondering when I’m gonna see you again’, paired with visuals of her on the screens, left bandmates Cheryl, Nadine Coyle, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh holding back tears when performing in her hometown of Manchester. They have not released any new music or filmed any music videos, but have opted to celebrate their rich back catalogue and groundbreaking success they achieved as a five. Sarah’s spirit has been prominent throughout the tour so far, not only in the intense and emotional moments, but in the exciting, lively and funny moments too. Advertisement Advertisement In a show on BBC Radio 2 on Monday (May 27), Kimberley Walsh said: “For me, I just love, I can see it in my mind whenever I want, seeing her perform Footloose on tour. “To me, it just epitomises everything about her that was just so electric and wild. And the way she moved, like everything! If I need to feel Sarah that's what I watch.” Sign up for our free newsletters today And lighthearted moments have been present in the shows, particularly when things are not quite going to plan - one wardrobe malfunction saw Cheryl’s dress fail to inflate with the rest of the band, and Nadine Coyle endured a lyric slip-up in their Dublin show. Mid-way through their cover of The Pointer Sister’s Jump, she appeared to be getting the lyrics wrong before singing in their place, “I’m singing the wrong words,” and laughing as she carried on with the performance. Advertisement Advertisement Here is everything we know about the emotional, exciting, and hopefully mistake-free performance that Sheffield fans should expect tonight. The tram maintenance works provide a bit of an obstacle to some concert-goers tonight. Instead of taking the tram from the city centre to the Arena stop, use the temporary Green service. It will operate from Sheffield Station to Meadowhall , and will take you directly to the Arena. Advertisement Advertisement Car parking tickets at the arena have sold out, but Meadowhall have agreed to let Girls Aloud fans park in their Blue and Green car parks until 12.30am on May 29. Meadowhall has direct access to the Arena tram stop via tram (seven minute journey from the Tinsley Tram Stop), or it is a 25 minute walk. More information on the specific tram disruptions can be found here . The timings, approximately, are as follows: Car park and box office: 4pm Doors open: 6pm DJ Mr Theo: 8pm Interval: 8:30pm Girls Aloud on stage: 8:45pm Curfew: 11pm For the shows so far, fans have documented the setlist as follows: Untouchable The Show Something New Love Machine Can’t Speak French Biology Whole Lotta History Wake Me Up Sound of the Underground Girl Overboard No Good Advice Graffiti My Soul Long Hot Summer I’ll Stand by You Sexy!

        "content": "Pakistan has demanded the Taliban government in Afghanistan to hand over outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) , who were involved in the attack on Chinese engineers in Shangla district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, reported ARY News. The attack, which took place on March 26 in Bisham city in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Shangla district, claimed the lives of five Chinese engineers along with one Pakistani citizen. The incident took place when the convoy was travelling between Islamabad and a hydroelectric dam construction site in Dasu in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The District Inspector General (DIG) of Malakand said that a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a convoy of Chinese nationals, as reported by ARY News. Addressing a press conference along with officials of the National Counter-Terrorism Authority (Necta), Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said Pakistan has taken up the issue with the Afghan interim government and urged them to take action against terrorist activities being carried out on their land. The interior minister added that the TTP orchestrated the Shangla terror attack from inside Afghanistan. “We have requested the interim government in Afghanistan to arrest the leadership of banned TTP,” he said. Following the attack, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif instructed the concerned authorities to conduct a thorough joint investigation into the Shangla suicide attack on Chinese nationals, utilising all the resources of the state. PM Sharif chaired a high-level emergency meeting in the aftermath of the attack on Chinese nationals, further appreciating the alacrity with which law enforcement agencies and locals responded to the attack, saving many lives that could have been lost. “Terrorism is a transnational threat that has been instrumentalized by the enemies of Pakistan to stymie Pakistan’s progress and development. The acts targeting Pakistan-China friendship are particularly aimed at creating mistrust between the two iron brothers,” he said. However, on Sunday, while briefing the journalists, Interior Minister Naqvi said that the probe agencies have prepared an investigation report, adding that they had concrete evidence that the TTP used Afghan soil to carry out the terror attack on Chinese engineers, reported Al Jazeera.

        "description": "Restaurant owners pledge to work with food safety officials to make eating out scare free",
        "content": "For the first time, it is not Hyderabad’s favourite biryani that is making news. It is more about contaminated food, unhygienic kitchens, use of synthetic colours and whatnot. Raids by food safety officials of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) have brought out a rather ugly picture that raises serious concerns about whether the food being served at restaurants in Hyderabad is safe for consumption. As a consumer, I only see, smell and taste what is served to me. As an initial thumb rule, in the current situation, should we or should we not eat out? How can one decide which eateries are safe? The best choice is to stick to your favourite trusted place and order dishes that have to be made fresh. Avoid cut fruits outside during summer. Next, look for the smell and taste of food at the first bite. But then we worry how does one know what is happening in the kitchen? Can consumers walk into restaurant kitchens to see for themselves? Balaji Raju, Assistant Food Controller at GHMC, says while there is no rule on kitchen visits by a customer, a diner can question the food hygiene and taste in case of doubt. Balaji Raju says, “In case of doubt, any consumer can bring a food sample to the state food lab at Nacharam and submit it for a test for a nominal fee of ₹200. The colour of foods can be questioned outright. Food colour is only permitted for use by bakeries and sweets shops. The food scientific committee allows 100 parts per million (ppm) colour per kilo only for bakery and sweets.” Wake up call Many eateries in the city have been fined or have been served notices for issues ranging from cramped wash areas, lack of ventilation, and untidy kitchen floors, as well as for more serious issues such as the use of expired dairy products, improper storage of food, food infested with fungus, use of stale oil and many more similar health hazards. How can restaurants minimise the concerns of consumers? Nishant Sinha, of The Roastery Coffee House says they were served notice for an uncovered dustbin. “The notice was a shocker, however, after we started working on it, we realised the importance of the checks by the GHMC; how important it is to stick to the guidelines of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. That allowed us to pull up our socks and improve. It keeps us in check.” Anumula Shashank, managing director, Cafe Niloufer looks at complaints as constructive criticism. He says, “Consumers have every right to raise their doubt. Only then do we get the opportunity to show them the BTS (behind the scenes). We had a complaint about part of a pista shell on one of our dishes. That complaint led us to create a separate section for sorting. Problems make us work better. The food safety checks are a good opportunity for the restaurant industry as a whole to up our game.” Be prepared Shashank suggests that restaurants plan their inventory for stored goods (dry items) in such a way that there is no scope for expired goods. “There is no point in stocking huge quantities. As a food establishment, we also have separate cleaning staff for different sections and floors,” he said. The National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) Hyderabad chapter is doing everything possible along with GHMC to educate food handlers on various stages of food handling — from receiving raw materials to storage, cold storage and handling of food in the kitchen — before it reaches the chef. Sampath Tummala, Chapter head, NRAI Hyderabad says, “A special task force formed by the NRAI has already been working on raising food and safety standards. We conducted Food Safety Training and Certification (FOSTAC) training for over 120 food handlers. While the ongoing raids have caused concern across the city, NRAI Hyderabad has clearly stated its intent to continue its work with the government and restaurateurs to improve hygiene and health standards. In the coming weeks, we will be setting up a variety of seminars and workshops to involve, update and educate all the parties involved on the standard requirements.” Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Hyderabad / food and dining (general) / food safety",

        "content": "News | Politics I would like to be emailed about offers, event and updates from Evening Standard. Read our privacy notice . The Mayor of London has called the Government ’s failure to deliver the Criminal Justice Bill and ban zombie knives a “betrayal” of the safety of young people and communities. Sadiq Khan called for Home Secretary James Cleverly to put an end to the delay in the legislation and bring forward the laws to ban the sale of the weapons . “The Government’s failure to deliver the Criminal Justice Bill is a betrayal of the safety of our young people and our communities,” Mr Khan said. “After years of delaying vital legislation that has allowed these dangerous weapons to continue being sold on our streets and having talked the talk about banning zombie knives for years, they have failed to deliver on their promises. “But it’s clear my calls, along with the voices of survivors, loved ones of victims and campaigners, have frustratingly fallen on deaf ears. The Government are not taking this crisis seriously enough. These weapons have no other use than to cause maximum harm. They must be banned.” Mr Khan says he has invested £151 million in this year’s budget for policing and crime prevention in London. London Victims Commissioner Claire Waxman also lamented the government’s “failure” to follow through with the Bill. She said: “The failure of the Government to follow through with the Criminal Justice Bill is a betrayal to everyone who has campaigned tirelessly to get victims of crime the justice they deserve, including many victims and families who have already failed in the most unimaginable way by a justice system not fit for purpose. “Victims and families will feel that these hard-fought commitments have amounted to nothing. It is a terrible blow to all of us who continue to campaign for a better, fairer justice system. I urge the next Government to deliver these overdue commitments as quickly as possible.” It comes as the national lead for policing knife crime said underage teenagers buying knives online remains “a really concerning picture” for police, with illegal dealers selling weapons via social media. Commander Stephen Clayman said earlier this month that forces in England and Wales are keen to cut off the supply of weapons as part of efforts to stop injuries and deaths.

        "content": "Trekkers can embark on one of the most beautiful treks in India, Valley of Flowers National Park, a revered gem in Uttarakhand, starting June 1 this year. This article explains when the Valley of Flowers was discovered and when it got the UNESCO World Heritage tag. New Delhi: Nestled amidst the majestic Himalayan ranges, the Valley of Flowers offers a breathtaking view and an unforgettable experience for visitors. This UNESCO World Heritage Site spread over 87 sq km in the Chamoli district, Uttarakhand, is a testament to the beauty and serenity of nature. It forms one of the two core zones of the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve; the other is the Nanda Devi National Park. Explore the Valley of Flowers and its journey to becoming a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Campanula Latifolia in the Valley of Flowers (Photo credit: Andrea Robinson/Photodisc/Getty Images) Valley of Flowers: Location and Height It is located in the Pushpawati River valley, in the upper expanses of the Bhyundar Ganga River, near Joshimath, Garhwal. The Valley of Flowers lies between 30° 41′ to 30° 48’N and 79° 33′ to 79° 46′, and it is 20 km northwest of Nanda Devi National Park. The Valley of Flowers, which runs east-west, is approximately 15 km long and has an average width of 6 km. The Valley of Flowers is at a height of 3,352 to 3,658 meters above sea level and complements the rugged mountain wilderness of Nanda Devi National Park to the east. The park is open from June to October and is covered by heavy snow for the rest of the year. Valley of Flowers: History Due to its inaccessibility, the Valley of Flowers was little known to the outside world. Let us look at how the world knew it. 1931: Three British mountaineers, Frank S Smythe, Eric Shipton, and RL Holdsworth, lost their way while returning from a successful expedition to Mt Kamet and happened upon a valley full of flowers. All three mountaineers were so attracted to the beauty of this valley that they named it the “Valley of Flowers”. Smythe had authored a book of the same name. 1939: Botanist Lady Joan Margaret Legge visited the valley to study flowers. While traversing some rocky slopes to collect flowers, she slipped and died. Later, her sister visited the valley and erected a memorial near the spot. 1993: Botanist deputed by the Wildlife Institute of India, Prof Chandra Prakash Kala, also went to the valley and conducted a research study on the floristics and conservation of the valley for a decade. Kala made an inventory of 520 alpine plants that were exclusively growing in this national park and authored two books – “The Valley of Flowers – Myth and Reality” and “Ecology and Conservation of the Valley of Flowers National Park, Garhwal Himalaya.” Bistorta affinis captured in the Valley of Flowers (Photo credit: Andrea Robinson/Photodisc/Getty Images) Valley of Flowers: A Timeline Flowing river cascading through mountain mist in the Valley of Flowers (Photo credit: Andrea Robinson/Photodisc/Getty Images) Valley of Flowers: Flora and Fauna With over 650 different flower varieties, it is magical and entirely covered in flowers of all hues and varieties. Flowers like Blue Poppy, Cobra Lily and Brahmakamal can be found here. Established in 1982, the Valley of Flowers National Park is home to rare and endangered animals like the Asiatic black bear, snow leopard, musk deer, brown bear, and red fox. The park also contains birds, including the Himalayan monal pheasant and other high-altitude birds.",

        "description": "Myrie replaced his colleague on BBC’s News at Ten and is a favourite to replace him during election night coverage",
        "content": "Clive Myrie has said that it was “weird” reporting on the allegations surrounding his former colleague Huw Edwards. The former BBC News at Ten presenter resigned on “medical advice” after he was accused of paying a teenager thousands of pounds for sexually explicit images. Myrie replaced him in the role soon after. The 62-year-old, who had been off-air since the scandal broke in July last year , was alleged to have paid the young person £35,000. South Wales Police and the Metropolitan Police found no evidence of criminal conduct. In a new interview with Radio Times , the 59-year-old broadcaster, reportedly named “Saint Clive” by colleagues due to his impeccable reputation, spoke about the experience of reporting on his coworker. “When you end up doing a story that involves you reporting on your colleagues, it’s weird. That’s actually the best description,” he said, “It’s just weird. Because you’re not usually there to be talking about the staff in your newsroom.” Myrie, who has worked at the BBC since the 1980s, has been rumoured to be the favourite to replace Edwards as host of the BBC’s election night coverage. But the presenter said he was just appreciative of what he’d been able to achieve so far. “I’m incredibly pleased with what I’ve got,” he said. “And given that my parents were convinced that I’d made a big old mess of my career choice, they’re now very proud of me.” He added: “What I’m doing now is brilliant. I’m loving it. It’s amazing to be invited into people’s homes at 10pm.” Last month, it was revealed that the BBC had warned Edwards about his online conduct two years before the scandal that led to him being taken off air, according to confidential documents. According to documents seen by The Sunday Times , a woman in her late 40s urged the BBC to halt contact between herself and Mr Edwards after they exchanged messages on Instagram and email. The corporation spoke to Mr Edwards about his “ actions and social media use ” and understood the interactions were “to stop”, according to documents seen by the newspaper. The BBC said: “As set out in our statement earlier this week, Huw Edwards resigned on 22 April on the basis of medical advice from his doctors. The BBC accepted his resignation and we do not believe it appropriate to comment further.”",

By Telangana Today Updated On - 28 May 2024, 02:46 PM Hyderabad: Surgeons at Asian Institute of Nephrology and Urology (AINU) , Banjara Hills, on Tuesday announced successful removal of a rare, giant dumbbell-shaped testis tumor measuring over 40 cm from a 39-year-old patient from Kadapa. The complex surgery was challenging as the patient had undergone kidney transplantation about a year ago and was on high-dose of immunosuppressants and powerful steroids. Recently, he noticed swelling in his left testis, which he initially dismissed as a simple hydrocele. However, the swelling rapidly grew. Tests revealed a large tumor that extended from the left testis into the abdomen, surpassing the belly button. Abnormally high levels of Beta HCG, a testis tumor marker, elevated to more than 20 times the normal value, were also found. However, a PET scan showed no signs of tumor spread to other parts of the body. Dr. Rajesh Kumar Reddy Adapala, senior uro-oncologist led the surgery with surgical support from Dr. Dinesh, Dr. Nithyananda, Dr. Shifa and Dr. Srikanth. He was discharged on the third day after the surgery, Dr. C Mallikarjuna, MD, and Dr. PC Reddy, ED for AINU, said.

        "content": "Fortnite, the battle royale title, keeps introducing more and more crossover events for its fanbase. Epic Games’ title is laden with a variety of playable skins and there have been many unique collaborations across pop culture. A new leaked Fortnite survey has revealed that Epic Games has a long list of possible crossovers they might introduce in the near future, and there are some pretty exciting names on the list. The leaked Fortnite survey was posted on X by prominent data miner HYPEX (via X user JeayBR). It features a wild list of possible Fortnite collaborations that Epic Games might target to keep the party rolling in the game. This list contains the likes of Jessie Pinkman from Breaking Bad, and it would personally be a delight to see Pinkman do a 360-no-scope kill and the scenes would be wild indeed. NEW FORTNITE SURVEY !!️ Sukuna, Suguru Geto, Jessie Pinkman, Link, God of War 2005, Blue Lock, Spy x Family, Freddy Fazbear, PinkPanthress, CJ, Nicki Minaj, J Cole, Vinicius Jr, Johnny Depp, and more.. 👀 [Thanks for sending me this] — HYPEX (@HYPEX) God of War 2005 is mentioned, which is the first title in the God of War series. The classic, lean but muscular form of Kratos doing Fortnite celebrations? Bring it on. There are several fun names on this list including Real Madrid and Brazil superstar footballer Vinicius Jr., and Manchester City and Belgium footballer Kevin De Bruyne. Given that football players engage in Fortnite, it would be interesting if this collaboration becomes true and opens the door up for more crossovers. Actor Johnny Depp, and musicians Nicki Minaj and J Cole are also mentioned. A couple of anime such as Blue Lock, and Spy x Family are also apparently on Epic Games’ list for possible collaborations. Lethal Company-themed Fortnite collaboration The leaker also posted a potential Lethal Company-themed collaboration as Fortnite might soon introduce cosmetics based on the hit co-op horror indie game. The leaked image shows a Lethal Company-inspired suit, an oxygen tank back bling, alongside a pickaxe in the shape of a stop sign. LETHAL COMPANY x FORTNITE SKIN 🔥 — HYPEX (@HYPEX) While the possibilities seem endless, it is vital to remember that the leaked posts are not an official announcement that these collaborations would see the light of day, but the Lethal Company leak might just turn out to true, given HYPEX’s track record.",

        "description": "Annabel Nugent and Louis Chilton pick out 15 of the most surprising finales ever to grace our screens – expect major spoilers ahead",
        "content": "T here are many things that go into a memorable season finale : mystery; pace; character development. More often than not, however, audiences want a surprise – something intriguing enough to justify carrying on next season. Some of the most shocking moments in TV history have come during season finales. With another instalment on the horizon, there’s no need to offer audiences catharsis or resolution – if anything, the best season finales actively deny viewers those feelings. And the most straight-forward way of doing that? A good shock, usually followed up with a cliffhanger: a one-two punch that guarantees return customers. Shock value – while not always equatable with great storytelling – will always provoke some Twitter conversation in its wake. Look at the recent conclusion to season four of ITV’s Unforgotten – a masterclass in detonating a perfectly timed cataclysmic plot-bomb. But countless others before Unforgotten have triumphed in the art of shock too. Here’s our selection of the 15 most shocking season finales of all time... (As is to be expected, MAJOR SPOILERS lie ahead! You have been warned!) 15) Unforgotten, season four Viewers were left open-mouthed by the conclusion to Unforgotten ’s fourth season, which saw DI Sunny Khan (Sanjeev Bhaskar) solve the case of Matthew Walsh’s death, only to learn that his partner, Nicola Walker’s DCI Cassie Stuart, had succumbed to injuries she sustained in a car accident. Shortly after the episode aired, ITV confirmed that the series was renewed for a fifth series, which will see Sunny paired with a new partner – Cassie is gone, but certainly won’t be forgotten. 14) Spooks , season 10 British spy drama Spooks finally came to an end in 2011, having run on BBC One for nine years. The season 10 finale featured no shortage of incidents, but fans will most remember the tragic death of Ruth Evershed (Nicola Walker) in the arms of Harry Pierce (Peter Firth). The unfortunate and surprising nature of Ruth’s death – being stabbed with a shard of glass while trying to stop Sasha Gavrik from killing Harry – made this finale a savage blow for many Spooks fans. 13) Buffy the Vampire Slayer , season five Buffy was another show that liked to end its seasons with a bang. Season two saw superpowered schoolgirl Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) stab her vampire boyfriend in the heart, while season three saw her destroy her high school during a fight with the town’s demonic mayor. But season five remains the most shocking finale of all, as Buffy ended up sacrificing her life to save the world. The character was ultimately brought back early in the next season, but ending on the sight of Buffy’s tombstone made this episode a shocker for the ages. 12) Line of Duty, season three You’re pretty much guaranteed high drama in every Line of Duty finale – but the closer to season three probably stands above them all. Too much happened in the episode to aptly summarise here, but the excitement peaked when duplicitous DI Matthew Cottan (Craig Parkinson) was caught out by Kate Fleming (Vicky McClure), and managed to escape capture – only to be shot dead by his associates, jumping in the way of gunfire to save Fleming’s life. This unexpected moment of redemption capped what might be the finest season of Line of Duty to date in gripping, explosive style. 11) Game of Thrones , season five By the time season five rolled around, viewers knew that no character was safe from George RR Martin’s death grip but still Jon Snow’s murder came as a surprise. But bar the ending’s shock value – which fans of the book had already anticipated anyway – Jon’s “death” was almost instantly reversed in the second episode of the next season when he is resurrected by Melisandre. The event ended up having little consequence on the rest of Game of Thrones and actually undermined the show’s no-holds-barred approach to death that it had successfully set up in previous seasons (ahem... The Red Wedding). 10) Breaking Bad , season four Breaking Bad ’s fourth season saw the series’ best villain – fastidious meth baron and fried chicken restaurateur Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito) – meet an appropriately memorable end. The deadly cat-and-mouse game that Walter (Bryan Cranston) and Jesse (Aaron Paul) had been playing with Fring all season had one final surprise in store, as the pair recruit the help of the loathsome Hector Salamanca (Mark Margolis) to blow their nemesis in half. If that weren’t enough, the episode also deployed a shocking last-minute twist, as it hinted that Walt is responsible for poisoning the six-year-old son of Jesse’s girlfriend, Andrea.

The last scene sees Kevin Spacey’s machiavellian Frank Underwood entering the Oval Office, kicking away his incumbent’s chair and rapping his knuckles on the table. Cliché? Maybe, but still gratifying to watch. More shocking than Frank’s new presidency, however, was the prospect of Claire Underwood (Robin Wright) showing any semblance of emotion. The sight of Frank’s ruthless partner-in-crime crying while perched on the staircase was the finale’s truly shocking moment. 8) Lost , season three After three seasons of Lost , audiences had grown extremely familiar with the flashbacks format of the show – so when creator Damon Lindelof flipped the script on us, we didn’t see it coming. The two-hour long special interspersed what we thought were cursory flashbacks, only for them to be revealed as “flashforwards” in a surprise twist ending. The flash sequences, in which Jack is depressed, addicted to Oxycodone and wishing to return to the island, take on a new meaning in this new, disturbing light. Suffice to say, the third series finale went down with fans a lot better than the show’s actual end three seasons later. 7) Homeland , season one Throughout the entire first season of Homeland , you’re left guessing whether or not Damian Lewis’ US Marine Nicholas Brody had in fact returned to the US as a radicalised terrorist. In the high-octane finale, it is revealed that Brody was in fact recruited by al-Qaeda, and had been planning a large-scale attack. A malfunction with his bomb jacket prevents him from going through with it, however, and the character ultimately survives for another two seasons – before another shocking finale saw Brody executed by Iranian authorities. 6) The West Wing , season four Aaron Sorkin went out with a bang on his final episode as writer of the political drama before he left in 2003. The hour-long episode sees Bartlet (Martin Sheen) invoke the 25th Amendment – in which the vice president steps in if the president is unable to do their job – after his daughter Zoe (Elisabeth Moss) is kidnapped. Given that the VP office is vacant due to John Hoynes’s sex scandal, this allows the Speaker of the House, Glen Allen Walken, to assume power, telling Barlet: “You are relieved, Mr President.” Chills. 5) Battlestar Galactica , season three The Sci-Fi Channel’s Battlestar Galactica reboot had fans reeling at the end of its third season, when it was revealed that four of the show’s popular characters had in fact been Cylons (the robotic nemeses of humanity) all along. Previously unaware of their identities, Chief Tyrol, Samuel Anders, Saul Tigh, and Tory Foster all come to the simultaneous realisation about their identities in a montage set to “All Along the Watchtower” – a moment that had massive ramifications throughout the remainder of the series. 4) Dexter, season four The most surprising series finales often coincide with the most heartbreaking, which was certainly true of Dexter ’s fourth series. Fans will remember the scene perfectly: Dexter comes home to find his wife Rita dead in the bathtub, murdered by Arthur (aka The Trinity Killer, played brilliantly by John Lithgow). While there were a few clues interspersed in the minutes leading up to the tragic reveal – the baby crying, lingering shots – Rita’s death was one of the biggest shocks to rock Noughties TV. 3) 24 , season one There was hardly a dull moment on 24 , a viewing experience that can be compared to a day-long heart attack. But out of all the twists and turns, it is hard to live up to the bombshells dropped at the end of its first season. Not only was Nina Myers, the distinguished federal agent and confidante of our hero Jack Bauer, revealed to be the mole selling government secrets – but in her attempts to keep her cover she murders Jack’s wife Teri. Cue the hysterical crying. 2) The Good Place , season one There are few shows that actually catch you by surprise. Most of the time, the viewer has some inkling that a twist is on the way, but it’s safe to say that jaws dropped worldwide at the season one finale of The Good Place . We found out that despite appearances, Eleanor (Kristen Bell) and her cohort aren’t living it up in heaven but are actually the victims of a newfangled means of torture in hell. Even the film’s cast – minus Bell and Ted Danson – weren’t clued in on the afterlife-altering twist. 1) Dallas, season three It was the season finale to end all season finales. The third season of CBS’s hit Texas soap opera Dallas concluded with the shooting of amoral oil baron JR Ewing (Larry Hagman) by an unknown assailant. For eight months (between the airing of \"A House Divided\" in May 1980, and the start of the fourth season in October), the character’s fate and shooter were left in limbo. The US was consumed with the mystery of “Who shot JR?” The episode left a lasting imprint on pop culture; years later, the famous cliffhanger was still being parodied on series like The Simpsons , which ended its sixth season with “Who Shot Mr Burns?”",

        "content": "In the digital age, our lives and businesses are intricately woven into the fabric of the online world. From financial transactions to client communications, much of our business activity takes place in the digital realm. Yet, many small business owners overlook a crucial aspect of estate planning: the digital estate. Digital estate planning is a critical aspect of overall estate planning for small business owners. Here, we outline essential considerations for your planning process. In the digital landscape, passwords are the keys to the kingdom. Many small business owners fail to keep track of their myriad passwords, leading to potential complications during estate settlement. Make a comprehensive list of all your online accounts, along with their passwords. Consider using a password manager to store this information securely. A few years ago, no legal guidance on dealing with digital assets existed. However, most states have passed a version of the Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act (RUFADAA), which helps govern access to digital assets by fiduciaries in the event of incapacity or death. Ensure your estate planning documents, such as wills, trusts and powers of attorney explicitly address RUFADAA provisions. Designate a trusted individual to manage your digital assets and give them the legal authority to access and manage them on your behalf. Generally, digital asset ownership is first governed by the terms of service agreement set when you set up the account. Access to these assets post-death can be impacted by using an online digital estate tool and your estate documents. If you do not update these documents you will likely cut off access to many of your digital assets upon death, leaving a permanent mess for heirs. Designate fiduciaries, such as executors or trustees, and ensure they have access to your digital accounts. Provide them with usernames, passwords, and any additional authentication methods required to access them. Communicate your wishes regarding the management of these assets to your designated fiduciaries. And, let them know your wishes for digital assets whether to preserve, destroy, or transfer them. Angela Wagner, attorney, and wealth director for Bryn Mawr Trust says, “Today, with family living in other states and traveling, it is vitally important that those named to act in your Health Care and Durable General Powers of Appointment have access to those documents virtually. In an emergency, they can immediately act on your behalf.” Ensure that all your digital accounts are correctly titled in the name of your business entity. This is crucial for clarity and legal compliance, especially in the event of business succession or transfer of ownership. Review the ownership details of all your digital accounts and make updates to ensure they are properly titled in the company’s name. Guard against single points of failure by diversifying access to your digital assets. Avoid relying solely on a single individual to manage or access critical accounts. Instead, designate multiple trusted individuals and establish clear protocols for accessing and managing these assets in your absence. Digital estate planning is a critical aspect of overall estate planning for small business owners in the digital age. By proactively addressing issues, you can ensure the seamless transition of your digital assets and protect the interests of your business and loved ones. Consult with legal and financial professionals experienced in digital estate planning to develop a comprehensive plan tailored to your needs and circumstances.",

        "content": "To most residents of Kujigbi, a remote settlement in Kuje Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), the most pressing challenge has been how to put three square meals on their table. They are more interested in anything that could provide an escape route out of poverty and hunger. Although residents of the community can be said to living very close to the seat of power in Nigeria, hunger and poverty had been a major enemy they contend with on a daily basis. They seem to have no connection with the sophistications that go with modern life because they lack access to social development and can be said to be disconnected from the larger society in Nigeria. Apart from hunger and poverty, the community, suffers from acute deprivation of basic social amenities. The people seem to have learnt to live their lives with or without government’s intervention. While they may not be presently facing food shortage, they definitely cannot boost of a resilient food system. However, they will live to remember this year’s United Nations’ World Food Day because the celebration has undoubtedly brought them the kind of message that soothes the heart. The message of the World Food Day, became more meaningful to them, when an Abuja based nonprofit organisation, Princely Kids Foundation and other partners stormed the community to propagate the ideals of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which the celebration highlights. The event featured talks to sensitise the people about how to meet their basic food needs and meet the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. Inside Abuja learnt that the Foundation deliberately chose the occasion of the World Food Day 2020 to highlight how food and agriculture are an essential part of the COVID-19 response, and how it could support the efforts towards economic recovery, especially for people who are limited by many socio-economic factors. Princess Jombo, who led the team to the community , stated that fighting hunger and poverty is an essential part of nation building. Jombo who struggled to hold back emotions on seeing the economic conditions of these rural people, called on privileged Nigerians to make more commitment towards empowering the less privileged members of the society. She said that an egalitarian society where citizens are empowered to actively participate in the governance process, cannot be achieved when basic needs of humanity like food and shelter remain an unaffordable luxury. She revealed that over the years, her Foundation with the support of some individuals and partner organisations have reached out to vulnerable communities, to bridge the ever widening gap between the poor and the rich. “Poverty breeds hunger and hunger breeds much more. We need to create a playing field for everyone, because we all need a chance for a better future. Let us empower each other to become much more,” she said. Jombo noted that when people have access to decent food, the mind would have been empowered to contribute meaningfully to the growth and development of their community. She explained that delivering food items to over 500 indigent residents in Kujigbi community was a part of the efforts of her Foundation and partners to support the well articulated objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) According to her, the noble objectives which the proponents of SDG seek to achieve cannot be left for the government alone, but must be the collective responsibility of all stakeholders. Jombo noted that her team identified the community as one of the most vulnerable segments of the population in dire need of assistance in Abuja. Inside Abuja learnt that the Foundation in collaboration with other partners were working out measures to reach out to more vulnerable communities both within the FCT and other parts of the country. It was further learnt that there were some programmes already articulated to meet special needs of vulnerable children and women in hard-to- reach remote villages across the country. “Today we stand with over 150 countries and we promote global sensitization and an undertaking for those who suffer from hunger and malnutrition. This day creates a view for us to look into our future. Let us grow, nourish, and sustain because together, our actions are our future. “Today, we take collective measures and we say no more. We say: NO! to hunger, NO! to poverty, No, No, No. The covid-19 pandemic has been a time to reflect. The World Food Day 2020 is a call for global cooperation and solidarity. This year gives clarity and explains the uttermost need to help the most vulnerable recover from the crisis”, Jombo said. Inside Abuja gathered that one of the critical points of SDGs is to fight hunger and poverty, with reliable dietary plans for rural families. Seeing the crowd of Kujigbi residents who gathered to receive food and other assistance from the visiting team, was a resounding evidence that hunger could be a more lethal weapon to humanity than the pandemic. The confessions of some residents of the community gave credence to the fact that what the rural people need to become productive members of the society, could just be food on their table. While Lukas Japhet said that the rice gift, members of the community received from the team was an unaffordable commodity to most of them, Esther Kunegi noted that many families had gotten an unquantifiable solace..",

        "content": "Congress National President Mallikarjun Kharge said on Tuesday that if the INDIA bloc comes to power at the Centre, they will exclude agricultural equipment from the GST ambit. Addressing a press conference here today, Kharge targeted PM Modi-led BJP government at the centre and said that when farmers tried to enter Delhi to put forward their demands, tear gas shells were fired at them. \"Punjab and Haryana, despite having less land geographically, produce the most in the entire country. The country gets food from these two states. The farmers here think that their prices should be good and fair according to the MSP. Farmers agitated (2020-21) and put forward their demands before the BJP government. But still, the government did not agree. Tear gas shells were fired at them. The farmer remained sitting on the streets for the whole year,\" Kharge said. \"We will give legal guarantee to MSP which is one of our five Nyay (Justice),\" he added. The Congress President also mentioned that their government will also provide 10 kg of free grains to the people. \"Along with five Nyay, our party has also given 25 guarantees. We will give 10 kg grains free to the people. We will work to pay the crop insurance compensation amount within 30 days. We will exclude the agricultural materials from the GST ambit,\" he said. Various agricultural equipment currently attracts GST at 5-12 per cent. Further, Kharge pointed out the drug problem in the state and termed it as the biggest challenge for the future of Punjab. \"Today there is frustration among the youth of Punjab because the drug addiction here has become the biggest challenge for the future of the state. It is because of this, that law and order in the state is getting worse day by day. Farmers are selling their land and sending their children abroad due to the fear that they may fall into drug addiction because employment opportunities are not available here,\" the Congress President said. \"Demonetisation and wrong GST have caused great harm to the MSMEs of Punjab. If our government comes, we will make it very simple and whatever steps are required to run small-scale industries, we will implement them,\" he added.",

        "content": "International donors led by the EU have pledged five billion euros ($5.4 billion) for Syrian refugees, as Brussels insisted they should not be \"pushed back\" to their war-torn homeland. An annual gathering hosted by the EU and chaired by its foreign policy chief Josep Borrell saw the European Union commit 2.12 billion euros for 2024 and 2025. That figure included 560 million euros already promised this year for Syrians displaced inside the country and in Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, and the same amount for 2025. The bloc also pledged one billion euros for Syrian refugees in neighboring Turkey. \"The situation in Syria is more dire today than one year ago. In fact, it has never been so dire and humanitarian needs are at all time high,\" Borrell said. \"Today 16.7 million Syrians are in need of humanitarian assistance, the highest level since the start of the crisis over 13 years ago.\" EU humanitarian chief Janez Lenarcic said that on top of the five billion euros in grants, a further 2.5 billion euros was promised by donors in loans. He said the EU and its member states overall accounted for three quarters of the grants pledged. The United States said it had also pledged nearly 545 million euros ($593 million) in humanitarian assistance for Syria. Washington \"remains committed to assisting the Syrian people and encourages other donors to continue their support for Syrians,\" a State Department statement added. The donor drive came after the United Nations refugee agency warned its operations to support displaced Syrians remained \"significantly underfunded at 15 percent almost six months into 2024.\" \"While we welcome the pledges made today, the discussion remains far removed from the harsh realities Syrians face,\" Oxfam's Syria director, Moutaz Adham, said. \"Funding still fails to match the scale of needs and year after year, the number of people relying on aid grows.\" - Not be 'pushed back' - In the face of the shortfalls, regional countries hosting millions of refugees from Syria have been increasingly pushing for \"voluntary\" returns to the country. But Borrell cautioned about any efforts to make people move back to Syria. \"We make a warning about the so-called voluntary returns of Syrian refugees to Syria,\" he said. \"Voluntary returns mean voluntary. The refugees should not be pushed back to Syria.\" Borrell insisted that the international community should not \"incentivize this by any means.\" \"We consider that there is not the safe, voluntary, informed and dignified returns of refugees to Syria for the time being,\" the EU's top diplomat said. Syria's war has killed more than half a million people and displaced millions more since it erupted in 2011 after Damascus cracked down on anti-government protests. More than a quarter of Syrians live in extreme poverty, the World Bank said Saturday, 13 years into a devastating civil war that has battered the economy and impoverished millions. Borrell said that efforts to find a political solution to the conflict remained at an \"impasse.\" \"The Assad regime has shown no intention of engaging in any meaningful political process,\" he said. \"We request everyone, including partners in the region, to use their political leverage to encourage a renewed impetus on the political process.\"",

        "content": "Cyriel Dessers will undergo scans this week to determine the length of time he will be out of action after injury in the Scottish Cup Final defeat to Celtic on Saturday. The Gers manager Philippe Clement had to withdraw the 29-year-old forward during half-time at Hampden Park following an ankle injury, and Glasgow World reported that Dessers left the stadium wearing a protective boot on the right leg. Speaking post-match, Dessers said, “I got injured in the first half, after around 25 minutes, it’s my ankle. “I tried to go on because obviously it was the game of the year, the big final at the end of the season, one big push. But I had to come off. I’ll get it assessed in the next few days.” But Dessers injury may force Clement’s hand in his search for a new striker in the summer transfer window. If, as Clement expects, he has torn ankle ligaments, the Nigeria international may not be back in full training until the start of next season. Dessers has been the Gers’ focal point this season, particularly since Clement’s arrival at Ibrox in mid-October, and scored 22 goals in all competitions as the club’s leading striker However, his profligacy in the box has seen him receive significant criticism from both pundits and fans, particularly in recent weeks as the Gers’ push for the Premiership title fell away at the final hurdle. As such, despite breaking the 20-goal barrier during his debut campaign with the light blues, the consensus amongst pundits is that Clement must upgrade his attacking stocks this summer – a consensus established well before Dessers’ ankle injury. With Scotland’s player of the year Lawrence Shankland reportedly set to become the subject of a bidding war between the two Old Firm rivals, Rangers must ensure they win that particular race if they want to overcome Celtic next season. A fit-again Dessers playing in tandem with or as an alternative to Shankland would give Rangers an embarrassment of riches up front, and with Danilo and potentially Sam Lammers to add to the mix, the Nigerian’s ankle injury could prove to be a blessing in disguise for the Gers, forcing them to speed up their most necessary piece of summer transfer business.",

        "content": "Larry Bird’s affection for Bill Walton has never been a secret. While they played together only a short time, Walton was one of Bird’s favorite teammates. After Walton died Monday at age 71 after a battle with cancer. Bird issued a statement mourning his loss : “I am very sorry about my good friend, Bill Walton. I love him as a friend and teammate. It was a thrill for me to play with my childhood idol and together we earned an NBA Championship in 1986. He is one of the greatest ever to play the game. I am sure that all of my teammates are as grateful as I am that we were able to know Bill, he was such a joy to know and he will be sorely missed. My family and I extend our sincere condolences to the Walton family.” The fast friendship that emerged between the two men during their short time as Celtics teammates was well-chronicled. The gregarious Walton helped bring Bird out of his shell and even brought him to a Grateful Dead concert. Walton and Bird led Boston to the 1986 NBA Championship together before the recurrence of foot problems left to Walton’s retirement a year later. “If Bill could’ve finished his career from start to finish healthy, there’s no telling where he would be ranked in the best players ever,” Bird said in ESPN’s 30-for-30 on Walton.

        "content": "Jennifer Lopez has expressed her alarm after her image was used in fraudulent AI scams. The star, who is currently starring as the central character in Netflix's newest sci-fi flick Atlas - a film concerning issues of AI - voiced trepidations about technology's rapid progression, particularly considering her public persona. J-Lo, 54, remembered adverts falsely \"selling skincare that I know nothing about\", featuring doctored images of her face complete with aged wrinkles. For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US . READ MORE: Reese Witherspoon's ex Ryan Phillippe shares 'hot' throwback of former couple J-Lo voiced her concerns Speaking to Variety, she said: \"It's really scary. Right away we had them stealing our faces. So, yes, [AI] is really scary.\" However, she also acknowledged that AI carries potential benefits and encouraged a balanced perspective towards both its positive and negative aspects. She added: \"I think you should be respectful of AI...We have to be open to all possibilities.\" Emphasising on the last note, the Hustlers star said, \"These movies that are talking about AI - especially this one - do a really good job of showing both sides.\" As for 'Atlas', J-Lo, who portrays a data analyst employing AI to shield Earth from an evil robot played by Simu Liu, highlighted how the movie presents both sides of the AI debate. She clarified: \"I think this movie does a good job of showing how AI could go incredibly wrong, and this is how it could go really right.\" Recently, Jennifer made her worries known regarding the abrupt emergence of AI in our daily lives, while also discussing filming some of the film's more intense sequences. Speaking to Extra, she expressed her concerns: \"I am. I'm worried about that. I think it's a scary thing and we have to kind of be careful about it and really think about where it's going.\" She recalled her initial expectations: \"I thought it would be me, by myself, do the takes, be so fast, don't have to worry about anybody else not remembering their lines... First day, you're falling through the planets. It's all going crazy.\" Reflecting on the intense filming process, she said: \"Now, your leg's broke... It was so high-intensity every day, and without having another actor kind of to give you half the energy, it's just all you. I was exhausted. I would leave the 'Atlas' set limping.\" Follow the Mirror US News page on Facebook All the latest news, showbiz, lifestyle and sports updates, brought to you by our dedicated American team.

        "content": "The Rector of Yaba College of Technology (YABATECH), Lagos, Dr Ibraheem Abdul, has assured stakeholders, particularly the members of the college community, of his administration’s continued dedication to driving progress and excellence of the institution. Abdul, who disclosed this during a public lecture organised as part of activities to mark his first year in office as Rector of the 77-year-old college, pledged that “more is still to come from his leadership that will signal a future filled with promise and innovation for the college.” While commending the innovation and development the college has witnessed under the leadership of the Rector, the Chairman, DSE Foundation, Chief Tunde Fanumokun, described him as a pride to reckon with and a technological game changer. Fanimokun, who chaired of the lecture, extolled Dr Abdul’s virtues, saying his simplicity and humility are some of his characteristics that have endeared him to the entire college community, declaring that YABATECH should be proud of a Rector that is a “game-changer” whose innovative ideas and leadership style have positioned the college at the forefront of tertiary education in Nigeria and beyond. In his keynote address, Pa George Majekodunmi Okufi, the first indigenous Rector of the College, also lauded Abdul for his innovative leadership style, which he said has brought about tangible improvements in the college. Therefore, Pa Okufi urged the college community to rally behind the Rectors vision of elevating the college to global standards. Also, the South-West Zonal Director of National Board for Technical Education (NBTE), Elder Ayo Aroge, commended the Rector for raising the standards of the college, adding that his commitment to Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) aligned with the Board’s mission to promote skills development across Nigeria. The guest lecturer, who is the Rector of Redeemers College of Technology and Management (RECTEM), Dr Awoh Stella Mofunanya, in her lecture on “Leadership and Service: The Need for Creativity, Innovation, and Excellence,” reiterated that in today’s rapidly evolving world, effective leadership and dedicated service require a blend of creativity, innovation, and excellence. She praised the Rector’s approach to incorporating these elements into his leadership style, ensuring that YABATECH remains adaptive and resilient in facing future challenges. “In today’s rapidly evolving world, effective leadership and dedicated service are crucial for the sustained growth and success of any organisation or community. The traditional models of leadership and service are no longer sufficient, hence the need for creativity, innovation, and excellence,” she stressed.",

In a release, Nova Scotia Health says two hospitals will offer a virtual option for people with urgent, but non-life threatening health issues. Fishermen’s Memorial Hospital in Lunenburg will offer the service starting today while Roseway Hospital in Shelburne will start the service on May 31. Nova Scotia Health says virtual urgent care is not a replacement for local emergency departments but it will will improve wait times and access when those departments are temporarily closed. With Digby General Hospital already offering the service, Virtual Urgent Care will now be available at three sites Monday to Friday, from 11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. and on Saturday and Sunday from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Even if the local emergency department is closed during these times, the virtual option will be available most days unless otherwise noted.",

        "content": "These are the 12 food swaps eco researchers want YOU to make at the grocery store 'to save the environment' (kiss goodbye to lasagna) READ MORE: Officials warn Americans about leftovers after woman paralyzed By Caitlin Tilley, Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com Published: 10:00, 28 May 2024 | Updated: 10:14, 28 May 2024 e-mail View comments If you want to save the planet, start by ditching beef lasagna. Choosing the vegetarian alternative will slash the greenhouse gas emissions of your meal by as much as 71 percent, according to a new study. Researchers looked at 22,000 products and assigned them to 12 common categories of groceries. They came up with eco friendly swaps between similar items, which will reduce emissions by 26 percent, as well as bigger swaps which are even more eco-friendly. Swaps were suggested that would have varying impacts on emissions, based on the greenhouse gases each product generates when made. Dairy, meat and processed food are detrimental to the environment because they require extensive land space, which is often created by cutting down trees, which releases carbon dioxide stored in trees into the atmosphere. Lead author and epidemiologist Dr Allison Gaines, who conducted the analysis, said: 'Dietary habits need to change significantly if we are to meet global emissions targets, particularly in high-income countries like Australia, the UK, and US.' As called for in the Paris Agreements, global emissions need to be reduced by 45 percent by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 in order to keep global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. In terms of soup, for instance, beef and vegetable soup was deemed as bad for the environment due to the large amount of greenhouse gases the meal creates. A slightly better switch would be to pea and ham soup, because pigs require less food and water. An even better switch would be to Dutch Curry and rice soup or curried sweet potato and turmeric soup, with the lack of meat significantly lowering the environmental impact. The best switch would be to an all natural three bean chunky soup, because it is the least processed of the five options. The more processed a food is, the more refining, transporting, and handling is needed, which all produce additional greenhouse gases. Meat products produce a lot of greenhouse gas emissions due to the methane, nitrous oxide and carbon emissions of livestock and their supply chains. What's more, deforestation to make way for space to rear cattle reduces the amount of trees that absorb carbon dioxide. Previous research from 2019 found that the percentage of all US emissions that are directly attributed to household consumption is only 20 percent. GOT A HEALTH-RELATED STORY? EMAIL: Health@dailymail.com Advertisement Roughly 31 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions could be attributed to to products consumed at home in 2019, with the three highest contributors being meat, dairy, and non-alcoholic beverages. It is estimated that only around one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to the food and agriculture sector. The researchers also recommended refraining from eating diary products such as a sweetened Greek style yoghurt with honey granola if you want to reduce your carbon footprint. More preferable is a dairy apple and rhubarb twist yoghurt, because an apple-based yoghurt will generate less greenhouse gases than a cow's milk one. A fully developed cow is estimated to emit up to 500 liters of methane a day due to its digestive processes. Even better would be a strawberry Greek style yoghurt or a strawberry yoghurt drink, as Greek yoghurt can be made with goat's milk, and may contain other things like condensed milk instead of cow's milk. To really do your bit for the environment, researchers said the best switch would be to a non-dairy yoghurt, such as gluten free cultured coconut milk with vanilla yoghurt. The production of diary results in significant greenhouse gas emissions such as methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide. In terms of bread, chocolate chip brioche rolls were deemed the worse, followed by mixed grain wraps, sliced white bread and dinner rolls. The switch that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions the most is to a sourdough loaf. This is because sourdough entirely avoids the chemical fertilizers used in making commercial wheat and yeast, as well as the carbon used in transporting this wheat and yeast hundreds of miles from source to factory. In America, the biggest source of the emissions in milk production are due to the production of food for the cattle, the methane cows give out during the digestive process, and the management of their manure. Researchers calculated the projected emissions of annual grocery purchases from 7,000 Australian households, using information from The George Institute’s FoodSwitch database. More than 22,000 products were assigned to categories of foods to quantify emissions saved by switching.

The British pop star, 37, was seen back in the Central American country once again after first meeting Armando Perez while on a girl's holiday in the surfer's paradise in December. Since then, Ellie, who confirmed her split from the father of her child Caspar Jopling, 31, in February, has been spotted several times on the vast coastline near Santa Teresa. Ellie flaunted her toned figure in a black bikini with her tied back in a low bun as she smiled at Armando who showed off his washboard abs in a pair of white swim trunks. The loved-up duo were joined by a friend on Friday as they laughed and chatted while walking down Playa Hermosa beach - a long stretch of white sand surrounded by palm trees. Ellie Goulding (right) and her hunky surf instructor boyfriend (left) were seen on a morning beach stroll in Costa Rica, just months after she announced her shock split from her husband of four years The British pop star, 37, was seen back in the Central American country once again after first meeting Armando Perez while on a girl's holiday in the surfer's paradise in December Earlier in the week the couple had been seen taking an evening dip together in the Pacific. Basking in the evening sun, the pair were seen emerging onto the beach where they met Perez's brother Gero, who he runs a surfhouse with. The pair were then seen wading into the ocean carrying a red surfboard laughing and chatting as the sun disappeared. The three-time Brit award winner wore a black swimsuit and her blonde hair around her shoulders as she lapped up the last of the day's rays. It marks the latest trip the singer has made to Costa Rica since ringing in the New Year in the tropical country that borders Nicaragua and Panama. Her first appearance alongside the surf instructor, who previously taught Colombian singer Shakira on the same beach, sparked a flurry of rumours that she had separated from art-dealer Armando. The pictures taken in February which showed Ellie frolicking around in the sea with Armando without her wedding ring only fuelled speculation that she and her husband had been living apart for six months. The once-loved couple, who were married in August 2019 at York Minster surrounded by A-list guests, were said to be trying to work out for their three-year-old son Arthur. Ellie flaunted her toned figure in a black bikini with her tied back in a low bun as she smiled at Armando who showed off his washboard abs in a pair of white swim trunks Ellie has been spotted several times on the vast coastline near Santa Teresa The loved-up duo were joined by a friend on Friday as they laughed and chatted while walking down Playa Hermosa beach - a long stretch of white sand surrounded by palm trees The pictures taken in February which showed Ellie frolicking around in the sea with Armando without her wedding ring only fuelled speculation that she and her husband had been living apart for six months They were then pictured back on the beach together in March Pop star Ellie and her estranged husband confirmed their split in February this year after four years of marriage After the first images emerged of Ellie cuddling up to Armando, the musician wrote on Instagram: 'In light of recent stories, I feel I have been left with no choice but to let you all know that Caspar and I privately separated some time ago. 'We remain the closest of friends and have been successfully co-parenting with our son's best interests at heart. 'We are committed to protecting our family privacy and thank people in advance for respecting our wishes - we won't be commenting further. Thank you.' Ellie and Mr Caspar who were introduced by mutual friend Princess Eugene, are now expected to divorce after exhausting all other options, sources previously said. Friends of the couple told MailOnline 'divorce is the only outcome' following their split after two years battling to save their relationship. Sources close to Ellie said it was not the ideal ending for her but it is the 'only one' after exhausting all possibilities with Caspar. A pal previously revealed: 'Ellie and Caspar have been over for some time now but there was this whole carry on of them pretending to be together. 'The fact is that it is over, Ellie moved on some time ago but she didn't want anyone to know.' They continued: 'But now she is enjoying the company of other men and there is simply no way back. 'It is so sad, especially because they have got little Arthur but they can't make it work and now it, really sadly, is going to end in divorce. There is no way that the marriage can be saved, the only way it is going to end now is by divorcing. 'It wasn't necessarily the outcome they have always wanted but that's where they are, Ellie is ready to date other men if he isn't already, Caspar surely will be back out on the market again soon.' Ellie and Caspar were last seen together on a family day out after the Burn hitmaker ended her friendship with Tory peer Zac Goldsmith to 'focus on her marriage.' The pop star and Caspar were married five years ago surrounded by celebrity friends including Sienna Miller, Orlando Bloom and Katy Perry. Their split was first rumoured in June 2023, when sources claimed they were 'living apart'. Ellie first hinted at her romance with Armando weeks ago as they both shared a snap in the exact same location on January 8 (left: Ellie's post, right: Armando's post) In a statement in February, the musician wrote: 'In light of recent stories, I feel I have been left with no choice but to let you all know that Caspar and I privately separated some time ago' Caspar added: Ellie and I remain the closet of friends and most importantly 'co-parents' to the best kiddo in the world, Arthur' Ellie has poured her heartbreak over her split from her art dealer husband Caspar into her new music (Ellie seen performing at the Royal Albert Hall in London in April) After weeks of discussions about how they would reveal their separation, the pop star's team finally revealed they had been spending time apart - blaming their 'hectic schedules' for the demise of their marriage. That same month Ellie was seen without her wedding and engagement ring when she attended the Serpentine Summer Party with Caspar. The singer's last trip to Costa Rica was made in April, where she once again was spotted along the shore with Armando, as she wore a skimpy black bikini teamed with white shorts. The loved-up pair had subtly hinted at a romance in January, with Ellie and Armando sharing a snap on Instagram in the same location. Perez and his brother are licensed instructors and run La Puente Surfhouse on Playa Hermosa beach, offering accommodation and lessons.

Learn more Dr Amir lists diabetes symptoms Chinese scientists claim they've found a cure for diabetes - a condition that affects more than four million people in the UK. Diabetes is a serious and life-altering condition that causes your blood sugar levels to become too high. According to the World Health Organisation , it is the ninth leading cause of death worldwide. There are two types of diabetes - type 1 and type 2 . While it is not known exactly what causes type 1, type 2 is typically linked to being overweight or obese , or not exercising enough. While there are steps you can take to manage or even put diabetes in remission, there is no known cure - until now. Scientists in China say they have cured diabetes for the first time. According to a report, published in Cell Discovery journal, cell transplantation could be the answer in the fight against diabetes. READ MORE Experts demand obesity action to cure sick note Britain after diabetes surge Scientists have found a way to 'cure' diabetes using stem cells (Image: Getty Images) The patient, a 59-year-old man, received the innovative transplant in 2021 and has been medication-free since 2022. As part of the treatment, scientists created an artificial version of cells found in the pancreas that produce insulin and keep blood sugar levels in check. The patient had suffered from type 2 diabetes for 25 years and had lost almost all function of these cells, known as islets, according to the report. Don't miss...

Prior to this, the only way to naturally regulate blood sugar levels was to overhaul the patient’s lifestyle - usually requiring a strict diet and exercise routine. But using this method, scientists were able to turn stem cells - which can act as a “blank slate” cell - into pancreas cells. These cells produce insulin, which tells your body when to take sugar from the food we eat for energy. Symptoms of diabetes to look for (Image: Express.co.uk) In diabetics, the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar leading to issues such as nerve damage, kidney damage, heart disease and more. Researchers found that implanting the new, lab-grown pancreas cells meant the patient could once again produce their own insulin. The findings were the result of decades of research, across many countries, into how best to turn stem cells into islet cells, and how to get those islet cells into the body. As reported by the South China Morning Post , one of the lead researchers, Dr Yin Hao, said: “Our technology has matured and it has pushed boundaries in the field of regenerative medicine for the treatment of diabetes.” Trending However, there is a chance this method may only work in patients with type 2 diabetes. This is because there is a chance the immune system in patients with type 1 diabetes might reject the new implanted cells. It is planned the therapy will be tested in more patients going forward. The study was a collaboration between three institutions based in Shanghai - the Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, the Centre for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Renji Hospital.

        "content": "A Division bench of the Orissa High Court has remitted the delay condonation application of the petitioner back to the Principal Commissioner of Income Tax ( PCIT ) as the rejection of the condonation application stating that the deficiency in the return could not be complied and the Form 3CB and 3CD as prescribed for filing of the return was required to be uploaded by the Chartered Accountant which came to the notice of the petitioner, who was ill, was done in an arbitrary manner. For the assessment year 2021-22 when the petitioner had submitted his return and the same was rejected on the ground of delay. According to the petitioner, the return under the provisions of the statute could not be furnished because of delay made under various reasons which were beyond his control and unless the delay is condoned, the filing of return could not be made by the petitioner. B. Panda appeared for the petitioner and S.C. Mohanty, Sr. Standing Counsel appeared for the Income Tax Department. As such, the petitioner was under treatment on account of his frequent illness and finally kept under the treatment of Dr. P.G. Satpathy, a Medicine Specialist for the period commencing from 22.03.2022 to 01.04.2022 and medical certificate was issued in this connection which was produced for consideration. The petitioner’s transactions for the assessment year 2021-22 was in fact coming under the limit of statutory audit as per Section 44AB of the Income Tax Act and unless the Auditor’s Report is accompanied in the IT return as prescribed, the filing of the return cannot be entertained. Since there was delay in furnishing the return, which was beyond the control of the petitioner, the same was rejected without taking into consideration the fact that the relief has been granted by the apex Court for condonation of delay. S.C. Mohanty, Senior Standing Counsel for the Income Tax Department vehemently contended that since there was delay on the part of the petitioner to furnish the return, therefore, the delay has not been condoned and the authority is well justified in passing the order impugned, which does not warrant interference of this Court at this stage. The bench noted that, “ it appears that the petitioner is a regular assessee before the opposite party-department. Even if the filing of IT Return was within his knowledge and was deriving income from sale of high speed diesel and income from firm’s business etc., he was required to file the IT Return disclosing the income at Rs.15,97,750/- and deposit of advance tax and all other dues of the department even if were paid to the credit of the IT Department and excess amount as per the statement prepared accrued the claim of refund at Rs.10,939/- and unless the return was entertained and delay is condoned considering the illness etc., it could not be possible to file IT Return in the relevant year. It was further noted that, “when the petitioner submitted the IT return, the delay could have been condoned invoking Section 119 (2)(b) of the IT Act.” On the whole the deficiency in the return could not be complied and the and 3CD as prescribed for filing of the return was required to be uploaded by the Chartered Accountant which came to the notice of the petitioner for the uploading on 31.03.2022. Therefore, the illness of the petitioner as well as uploading of statutory made on 31.03.2022 by the concerned Chartered Accountant made the delay which was beyond the control of the petitioner, the bench noted. The division bench thus observed that, “As such, the condonation delay application filed by the petitioner should not have been rejected straightway in a cryptic, confused and absurd manner without considering the orders passed by the apex Court as well as by this Court as mentioned above.” It was thus held that the order so passed by the Principal CIT, the opposite party no.2 dated 01.08.2023 under Annexure-1 cannot be sustained in the eye of law and the same is liable to be quashed and is hereby quashed. The Orissa High Court Bench of Justice and Justice G Satapathy remitted the matter back to the file of PCIT for fresh consideration, in view of the above. © 2024 Taxscan © 2024 Taxscan",

        "content": "Governments are letting down middle Australians and putting the next generation at risk of being worse off than their predecessors, the newest federal MP warns. In his first speech to parliament on Tuesday, Liberal MP Simon Kennedy vowed to stand up for the middle class, saying their needs and concerns were being ignored. Mr Kennedy, who replaced former prime minister Scott Morrison in the southern Sydney electorate of Cook, said middle Australia and small businesses remained the heart of the economy. \"Right now, our country is governed for the squeaky wheel, the vested interests, the large corporates with their lobbyists and their megaphones, it's not for the silent majority and definitely not for the small businesses,\" he said. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. \"The people of Cook don't complain, instead, they get on with things ... it's a microcosm of middle Australia, but rightly, they feel they are being ignored.\" A former consultant with McKinsey, Mr Kennedy ran unsuccessfully for the Liberals at the 2022 election in the marginal seat of Bennelong. He was pre-selected for Cook earlier in 2024 following Mr Morrison's retirement from federal politics, despite controversy over him not living in the electorate. Mr Kennedy said the lack of housing affordability and skyrocketing mortgages were key concerns. \"The promise of the next generation being better off than their parents is disappearing rapidly and it is hard to tell what this could do to Australia's social fabric if allowed to continue,\" he said. \"What used to make our country great is the government got out of the way and allowed middle Australia to build and grow.\" He said federal infrastructure funding should be tied to housing completion rates to boost supply, while industries should be further deregulated for small businesses to grow. Mr Kennedy also hit out at large levels of migration, which he said was impacting the economy. \"Record migration is being used to paper over the weakness of the Australian economy,\" he said. \"The 528,000 new entrants in the country only had 170,000 new homes to choose from. The maths just doesn't work. \"The government and corporate Australia tell us the economy is growing but you and your family are just getting poorer.\"",

        "content": "Bhubaneswar: Biju Janata Dal (BJD) on Tuesday moved the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) against Odisha BJP members accusing them of mounting violent attacks on ruling party leaders and supporters allegedly due to fear of defeat in 2024 elections. Senior BJD leaders brought to the notice of CEO two incidents of violence and vandalism allegedly by BJP workers and sought his intervention. In a memorandum, the regional party claimed that a campaign organised by Dharmasala MLA Pranab Balabantaray from Rahamba Rasalpur to Pakhara Gram Panchayat was disrupted by supporters of Himanshu Sekhar Sahoo, an independent MLA candidate, who was in BJP earlier. The petition alleged that BJP supporters who were in an SUV ran over 20 motorcyclists participating in the campaign, severely injuring four persons and causing minor injuries to many others. It further alleged that there was also an attack on BJD’s Pipili MLA Rudra Maharathy on Sunday in Terundia Gram Panchayat in Nimapara block by supporters of BJP leader Samirr Dash, a close associate of Nimapada BJP Assembly candidate Pravati Parida. In the attack, Maharathy’s car was badly damaged, the BJD petition alleged. The BJD leaders urged the CEO to ensure that the candidates can campaign in the elections without fear of violence and intimidation. Get real time updates directly on you device, subscribe now.

However, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has denied the charge and termed it as a tactic of the 28-year-old comedian to gain cheap popularity. Yadav’s allegations have come after a notice issued against him by the administration in connection with a case lodged two months back over a dispute with a person at Pithampur, located 40 km from here in the district. Also Read Watch: Comedian Gaurav Kapoor’s hilarious take on eating healthy The notice has been issued against Yadav by an executive magistrate under Code Of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) section 107 (requiring to show cause why he should not be ordered to execute a bond with a surety) for maintaining peace. Yadav, a resident of Pithampur, was among four persons arrested along with comedian Munawar Faruqui on January 1, 2021 following a complaint that objectionable remarks were made by the latter about Hindu deities during a comedy show at a cafe in Indore. The Indore bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court ordered the release of Yadav from jail on interim bail on February 26, 2021. In a post on Instagram late Sunday night, Yadav claimed, “In my hometown, I have a new identity as an anti-nationalist. There are a few people who are relatives and known affiliates of the ruling party, who have been harassing my brother and me for three years now.” “After getting released from jail, I haven’t been home for more than three days in two years because some of the goons here were continuously harassing us,” he alleged. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Nalin yadav (@nalinsaaheb) When contacted, State BJP spokesperson Alok Dubey said that the comedian was carrying out a false propaganda against his party in a bid to get cheap publicity through social media. According to police officials, a person, Sawan Singh Dabar, had allegedly assaulted Yadav in Pithampur on March 24 this year over an “old enmity” following which an FIR was registered against the former on charges of assault, abuse and issuing threats. Dabar had also lodged a complaint of assault against Yadav, they said. In view of the tension between Yadav and Dabar over the incident, the notice has been issued on an application of police, to both the parties to maintain peace. Yadav’s lawyer Ashar Warsi said legal options were being considered against the notice issued in the comedian’s name. Following a complaint by Nalin Yadav’s younger brother Akash, an FIR was registered at Sector Number-1 police station of Pithampur on November 21, 2023, against local residents Uday Raghuvanshi and Krishna Thakur on charges of assault, abuse and issuing threats “over an old dispute”, officials said. The comedian has alleged that different people from the same group in Pithampur area were constantly harassing him and his younger brother.

You must not drive onto the race route as you will potentially be putting the runners, volunteers, of which many children will be helping out, as well as yourself at risk.” The race organiser has asked everyone to be \"kind and respectful\" to the many volunteers in hi-vis jackets at road junctions who are giving up their time to make the event safe and enjoyable for all. A spokesperson added: \"They will do their best to keep you updated about what is happening and where feasible, give alternate routes to assist you.\" Road closure information The council has granted a temporary road closure notice for the route and a traffic management company has been hired to keep the route safe.

        "description": "A large scale blaze broke out on the site of Fenix Battery Recycling in Kilwinning on Monday, April 8.",
        "content": "Emergency services were called to Fenix Battery Recycling on Byrehill Place in Kilwinning on April 8 after the fire took hold. Hundreds of residents within an evacuation zone were forced to leave their homes while others were told to stay indoors, and keep their windows closed while the fire was brought under control. Six fire engines and a height appliance were sent to the scene and remained there until the afternoon of Friday, April 12. Almost two months on from the blaze, two enforcement notices have been served by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) requiring Fenix Battery Recycling Ltd to remove waste batteries that have been on the site at West Byrehill Industrial Estate for longer than six months. As the agency suspended the firm’s approval as an Approved Battery Treatment Operator (ABTO), no waste can be accepted, stored or treated by the company. SEPA says it has issued the enforcement actions following both non-compliance with licence conditions and site infrastructure being destroyed by the fire. They said continuing to carry on the licensed activities at the site in its current condition would be considered a risk which could cause serious pollution of the environment and serious harm to human health. Lin Bunten, SEPA chief operating officer, regulation, business, and environment, said: “The package of enforcement action we have set out is in response to a significant incident and designed to protect the environment and communities in the area surrounding the Fenix Battery Recycling Ltd site in Kilwinning. “The decision to suspend a licence is never taken lightly, but it is one of the enforcement tools we have available and one we will use when we believe it is required to prevent risk of harm to the environment. Emergency services have been at the scene of the fire since around 10pm on Monday night. “The operator is required to remove the waste which breaches licence conditions offsite to an appropriately licensed facility by the dates we have set out in the Enforcement Notices. “The suspension of the Waste Management Licence (WML) will remain in place until we are satisfied that the conditions as specified in the suspension notice have been adhered to – which include requirements concerning site infrastructure, a fire prevention and mitigation plan and fire detection system. “We partially suspended Fenix Battery Recycling Ltd’s licence last year when it failed to comply with a previous enforcement notice we served. This prevented them receiving any more special waste on site after 17.00 hours on November 3, 2023. We will not hesitate to take further action, in line with our enforcement policy, as required.” Get all the latest news from around the country Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country",

Advertisement The world of luxury real estate might seem like a place where deals are plentiful, transactions are swift, and satisfaction is guaranteed. But that isn't always true, especially in New York City, where a slowdown in demand has made selling multimillion-dollar condos and townhouses more challenging, StreetEasy Senior Economist Kenny Lee told Business Insider. This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . In many of NYC's upscale neighborhoods, homes are lingering on the market longer and sales are falling , signaling that when it comes to a slump in the real-estate market — not even the nation's wealthiest Americans can walk away unscathed. Consider the case of Sonja Morgan , the ex-wife of John Adams Morgan, a great-grandson of the founder of J.P. Morgan Chase . Despite Morgan's socialite status and her home's location on the posh Upper East Side, she has struggled to sell the five-story, six-bathroom brownstone. Advertisement Morgan, a star of Bravo's \"Real Housewives of New York,\" has owned the home at 162 E. 63rd St. for 27 years, living there on and off. Since around 2008, she has made numerous attempts to sell it, but has failed to attract any serious buyers. Now, after years of listing and delisting the property, she has opted to auction it with a starting bid of $1.75 million , far below its reported purchase price of $9.1 million in 1997, according to Curbed's Bridget Read. \"I wanna be free to garden and travel and not have to worry about the house — but I'm not taking nothing,\" Morgan told Curbed. Bidding opened with Concierge Auctions on May 16 and will remain open until May 29. As of May 24, the current highest bid is $4.25 million, according to the company. Advertisement Even the ultrawealthy lose in the game of real estate market Luxury real estate shows like \"Million Dollar Listing\" or \"Buying Beverly Hills\" often portray the selling of high-end homes as effortless. However, even with an elite ZIP code and the pedigree of a famous or rich seller, sealing the deal can still prove difficult. Michael Jordan , for example, has been unable to sell his mansion outside Chicago for more than 11 years. Related stories There's also the 105,000-square-foot megamansion in Los Angeles , developed by former film producer Nile Niami. Following ten years of construction, the home languished on the market without attracting a buyer. It was later placed into court-ordered receivership and subsequently entered bankruptcy proceedings. Finally, it was auctioned off for $126 million to the billionaire CEO of Fashion Nova, Richard Saghian , in 2022. The crux of the issue is that, the more expensive a home is, the fewer potential buyers it has — it's a troublesome scenario amid slowing buyer demand and growing economic uncertainty . The lack of demand from traditional buyers has led to an increasing number of ultrawealthy homeowners, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis , renting out their homes or auctioning them off rather than waiting around for buyers. \"A lot of luxury buyers may already have a primary home, so maybe they're looking for a new investment,\" StreetEasy Senior Economist Lee said. \"For that reason, even though they are generally less affected by high mortgage rates, they are heavily influenced by the general economic outlook.\" Advertisement That's partly why more luxury buyers are increasingly considering renting out their homes rather than selling them, he added. Custom features added by sellers and maintenance costs canalso put off buyers One person's dream renovation could be the next person's nightmare. Lee pointed out another obstacle for luxury homeowners: their inclination to elaborately customize their homes with features that may or may not be appealing to the average buyer. \"A lot of houses and apartments in New York City were built before the war ,\" Lee said. \"It's also for that reason, it's common for a lot of owners to go through renovations, to make it more livable and more to their own taste.\" Advertisement In addition to a koi pond in the garden, the Morgans also installed a large nautical star in the entryway on the ground floor during a $3 million renovation, according to Curbed. The nautical star the Morgans added to their Upper Eastside home. Concierge Auctions Lee noted another factor contributing to the difficulty of selling luxury properties: the high costs associated with their maintenance and upkeep. Morgan's townhouse carries estimated monthly property taxes of $6,003, per the StreetEasy listing . This figure doesn't include additional expenses that come with owning a townhouse such as insurance, repairs, upgrades, landscaping, and more. Morgan told Curbed she's ready to be rid of it all. Advertisement \"I don't want anyone to think, 'New York is done and that's why she's leaving,'\" Morgan said. \"I'll always be a New Yorker. I just don't need all this.\"",

        "content": "MAGA troll Sam Alito, having signaled his solidarity with Donald Trump’s insurrectionists by flying (or allowing to have flown) an upside-down American flag at his home, is disgracing the U.S. Supreme Court with his mere presence. That sentence barely scratches the surface. I need to elaborate. As the southern writer Flannery O’Connor said long ago, “You tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” The story is that Alito, having openly trumpeted his bias in flagrant violation of every judicial code of ethics, deserves to be impeached. But since that certainly won’t happen — there aren’t enough votes in the Senate, and the chamber’s Democrats are predictably too chicken to highlight the issue — at minimum Alito should recuse himself from the long-awaited “immunity” ruling that could whitewash Trump’s criminal liability in the Jan. 6 insurrection. That won’t happen, either. The current high court is a sinkhole of mendacity, and its own ethics code has more holes than a slab of Swiss cheese. For instance: “a justice should disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the Justice’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, that is, where an unbiased and reasonable person who is aware of all relevant circumstances would doubt that the Justice could fairly discharge his or her duties.” Alito can skirt that provision with ease. He can simply decide that none of his critics are “unbiased and reasonable.” Even though a federal recusal law says that “Any justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned,” Alito can simply decide for himself that his impartiality is being unreasonably questioned. So Alito is betting the story of his family’s stop-the-steal flag (and a second controversial flag flown at his Jersey Shore vacation home) will simply slide down the Orwellian memory hole, just like so many of MAGA’s fascist-adjacent perfidies. That wouldn’t happen if Senate Democrats raised hell and demanded Alito appear at a hearing to explain himself, but, as we know, Dems don’t do courage (“I don’t think there’s much to be gained with a hearing at this point,” said Judiciary Committee chairman Dick Durbin). The result: Alito has free rein to make a mockery of the oath he took to “faithfully and impartially discharge” his duties under the Constitution. And we become further benumbed as this once-vibrant democracy sleepwalks toward dystopia. In just the latest example, a video on Trump’s social media account said if he’s elected, we will have the “creation of a unified Reich.” That video prompted this reaction from ex-Trump deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews, who said, “Trump’s continued use of Nazi rhetoric is un-American and despicable. Yet too many Americans are brushing off the glaring red flags about what could happen if he returns to the White House. When someone shows you who they are, believe them.” But we were talking here about Alito. He went full MAGA last month during the oral argument about Trump’s fake “immunity” case — he worried that a criminal prosecution of Trump might “lead us into a cycle that destabilizes the functioning of our country as a democracy” — and now he’s poised to vote on the ultimate ruling. There is one foreseeable ray of hope. It’s possible that he and Clarence Thomas (the other most detestably compromised justice) will be outflanked. A narrow court majority could rule that Trump’s Jan. 6 insurrectionist conduct does not shield him from criminal prosecution and that the trial currently in limbo can indeed proceed. Such a ruling wouldn’t remove the stain of Alito’s treasonous flag-waving, but it would arguably salvage the court’s credibility — at least until the next scandal besmirches it.

        "content": "The Labour Court has ruled that Eskom’s practice of not shortlisting members of non-designated groups for advertised posts amounts to an absolute barrier and is not an affirmative action measure as contemplated by the Employment Equity Act (EEA). Judge Hilary Rabkin-Naicker, in a judgment handed down in the Labour Court in Cape Town on Friday, further ordered that “Eskom must take remedial steps to ensure that the said practice ceases”. ALSO READ: Stefanutti Stocks’ R1.6bn claim against Eskom expected to be resolved in Q3 Rabkin-Naicker issued these orders in a judgment to an application brought by Solidarity on behalf of Mr Altus Erasmus. Eskom discrimination The judgment referred to the fact that Erasmus was shortlisted for a post graded on Eskom’s “M16 Grade” because he described himself as “African” on the application form, and confirmation from Eskom officials that Erasmus would not have been shortlisted “in that round” of the application process if he had described himself as a “white male”. Erasmus has been employed by Eskom since 1 August 1988, was appointed as a project manager on “Managerial level M15” by Eskom Enterprises in September 2004 in the transmission telecommunication division, and was transferred to his current position of senior advisor outage coordinator on 1 January 2017. ALSO READ: R745m Kusile trial postponed as ex-Eskom exec ‘not feeling well’ She ordered it to pay him compensation equal to 18 months of his salary at the time he applied for the post of manager for site outage execution at a peaking power station for Eskom’s group technology division. Solidarity, in a referral on behalf of Erasmus, applied for an order that: Eskom unfairly discriminated against Erasmus on the grounds of race; The decision not to appoint Erasmus amounted to an absolute barrier and therefore constituted a quota system; Erasmus be promoted to the position, vacant position or similar position to that which he applied for and be compensated the amount of the difference in salary and benefits from 1 November 2017 up until now, as if he was appointed; Eskom compensate Erasmus to the maximum amount the court deems just and equitable; and Directs Eskom to take steps to prevent the same unfair discrimination, or a similar practice occurring in the future in respect of other employees. Judge Rabkin-Naicker did not issue any order in regard to the costs. A number of employees, including Erasmus, applied for the post and Eskom then followed a recruitment process to appoint a suitable candidate. Candidates who met the minimum requirements were shortlisted and interviews were conducted. Hennie Van Staden, Senior Manager: Outage Support and Execution (Peaking), wanted to appoint Erasmus to the post, but Erasmus was not appointed because it was preferred that the person appointed be an African male or a female of any race. ALSO READ: Court dismisses government and Eskom’s appeal against load shedding judgment He requested information in terms of the Promotion of Access to Information Act but Eskom did not comply with this request. CCMA findings This resulted in Solidarity on 12 July 2018 filing a referral to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) on behalf of Erasmus. The CCMA concluded the conciliation proceedings and issued a certificate of outcome on 6 August 2018 indicating that the matter remained unresolved. ALSO READ: Eskom and Transnet woes: Government-business collaboration pays off Valerie Dibela, who is currently employed as a human resources business partner at Eskom Transmission, agreed the decision not to appoint Erasmus had nothing to do with him saying on the application that he is an African but had to do with the fact that the employer said they cannot appoint him because he is a white man. Dibela confirmed that only specific race and gender groups, as identified in the GA13 staff requisition form, are shortlisted – and agreed that if Erasmus had identified himself as a white male he would not have been shortlisted “in that round”. Erasmus stated that as an employee of Eskom he was not aware of the practice of not shortlisting a member of an over-represented group and learnt that white males could not be shortlisted in the court proceedings. He was asked why he had indicated that he was an African when applying for the post and stated: “I have never seen in the past any opportunity where I could state that I am a white African because you could only select one of the two. “So it was my intention, intentionally I selected African. It was not to mislead at all ... It was in line with what I was doing, it was in line with my stance, and it was in line with what I was promoting within the business,” he said. Judge Rabkin-Naicker said Section 6(2) of the Employment Equity Act, whose object is to echo Section 9(2) of the Constitution, is quite explicit that affirmative action measures are not unfair. However, she added that this does not oust the court’s power to interrogate whether the measure is a legitimate restitution measure within the scope of the empowering. She said there is no valid reason why courts are precluded from deciding whether a valid employment equity plan has been put into practice lawfully. Rabkin-Naicker said there was no dispute that a white male, in terms of Eskom’s practice of implementing its affirmative action measures, had no possibility of being shortlisted for the post in question. ALSO READ: Eskom should shift focus to grid expansion, says André de Ruyter She said Eskom insisted that the practice did not amount to an “absolute barrier” because, provided a suitable candidate was not found from an under-represented group, there was the possibility for a wider second round of applications and/or a motivation being made for a particular white male to fill the post. “It appears to the court that the inflexible and blunt instrument practiced at the shortlisting stage must be recognised as an absolute barrier to the ability of members [of] non-designated groups to compete with employment equity candidates from the inception of a recruitment process,” she said. An ‘absolute barrier’ Rabkin-Naicker said the evidence before her established that an employment practice of Eskom amounted to an absolute barrier to non-designated groups and cannot be regarded as an affirmative action measure in terms of the act. “There are myriad ways to take equity targets into account during interviews of suitable candidates for a position, without blocking categories of persons from proving their worth to an employer in a recruitment practice and in the process infringing on their rights to dignity and equality,” she said. In regard to the relief sought by Solidarity/Erasmus, Rabkin-Naicker said this court would not usurp the role of the employer and promote Erasmus. “Given that I have found that Erasmus was unfairly discriminated against, I will however grant him compensation in an amount that I find to be just and equitable on the evidence before me,” she said.

        "content": "– As Company Commends Tinubu For CNG Initiative LAGOS – The Federal Government has assured that it would avoid the non-inclusion of Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing Company Ltd (IVM) in the award of contracts for the production of buses as part of the Presidential Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Initiative. This is as Dr. Innocent Chukwuma, the Chairman, Innoson Group, has commended President Bola Tinubu for the CNG Initiative following the removal of petrol subsidy. Mr. Ekperikpe Ekpo, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources (Gas), gave the assurance over the weekend during a tour of the existing IVM factory complex in Nnewi, Anambra State and the multi-billion new IVM plant to be opened soon with an installed capacity to manufacture 30,000 CNG vehicles annually. The minister described the non-inclusion as a “yesterday occurrence,” and encouraged Dr. Innocent Chukwuma, Chairman, IVM to continue to provide jobs to the teeming qualified people through his factories. Stakeholders and the public had criticised the Federal Government for not including Innoson Motors in the initial contracts when the names of the auto companies tasked with the supply of the CNG buses were made public. Innoson Motors had pioneered the manufacture of autogas vehicles, including buses of varied capacities, about two years ago, even before the coming onboard of this present administration. He said: “Today is a different day. I can assure you that we will make a move towards making amends from what has happened yesterday to make our person (referring to Dr. Innocent Chukwuma), proud of where he comes from, and that he is from Nigeria.” Besides, Ekpo expressed delight with Chukwuma for investing keenly in the manufacture of CNG vehicles and aligning with President Bola Tinubu’s commitment to using the CNG Initiative to dampen the effect of the removal of fuel subsidy on the masses. He said the massive production of vehicles that run on CNG by Innoson was giving a boost to the transition from petrol and diesel to gas. Ekpo also remarked that manufacturing activities at IVM were in line with the aspirations of Mr. President, stressing that the president would be delighted at the growth and expansion of the company. He reiterated that the plan of Tinubu for the use of CNG was to cut cost in the spending model of government and creating a greenhouse economy. “The Chairman took me to observe the exhaust pipe and when I saw it, it was very clean and nothing came out of it, and it was in the condition that we will really appreciate. So, I am really happy to see what I am seeing at Innoson. And I give him kudos for identifying with the President as he did this morning with his comment on moving “from gas to prosperity. By the special grace of God, we have a son of Nigeria who is making Nigeria proud in CNG vehicle production. When I return to Abuja, I will brief the president on what I have seen and what I have experienced. It is left for the President to take a decision on the direction to go. “There is a presidential committee on CNG. I will equally collaborate and sit down with them and talk about the issue, because we are looking at how to cut costs, reduce expenses which will add value to our country, Nigeria. So CNG vehicles should be patronised from all angles and I believe the President will support such aspirations,” he added. In his reaction, Chukwuma echoed his belief that the exclusion from the contract awards for the CNG buses by the Presidential Committee should be regarded as a thing of the past and a mistake, while expecting a fairer process in the future. He expressed that may be the committee was not aware the extent IVM had gone in manufacturing CNG vehicles since 2022, but stressed that the committee was now more informed about the company’s activities. He added: “But, it is not compulsory that they will use IVM to start the implementation of the CNG Initiative. They can use anybody’s brand to start. But, they will later understand the true position of things as time goes on. We are all working together to move the nation forward.” The Innoson Chairman also commended Tinubu for the CNG Initiative following the removal of petrol subsidy. He further lauded the president for directing government ministries and agencies to key in into the momentum for Nigerians to follow suit He said: “We have confidence in President Tinubu because he knows how to handle any situation. He is an expert and he showed it in Lagos State as a governor. So, we still believe he will do it with Nigeria. “All these things we are doing here are part of our efforts to support him, so that the government can be able to make Nigeria great. With all these things we are doing and everybody’s support, the president will surely make Nigeria great. I am building this new CNG factory now and the President is expected to commission it very soon.” One of the highlights of the minister’s tour was the demonstration of the fire-fightingchafacyetistucs of IVM fire trucks, and a segment-by-segment display of a wide range of IVM vehicles.",

This is the first time the university is offering seats to single girl children under the supernumerary quota. “The session is expected to start on August 1,” Gupta added in a press conference. The announcement was made during the launch of the CSAS portal for admission into undergraduate courses. “We will offer one seat in undergraduate and postgraduate programmes each under supernumerary quota from this academic year,” he said. Last year, the university started offering two seats each under supernumerary quota to orphans in all undergraduate and postgraduate programmes from the next academic year. The University of Delhi announced its policies and launch of admission to its various Undergraduate, Postgraduate and PhD programmes for the academic session 2023-24. The examination portal — CSAS (UG) — was also launched on the occasion. The university offers 79 undergraduate programmes and 183 BA programme combinations through its 69 colleges. There are close to 71,000 seats offered in the colleges. About 1,550 unique programmes and other college combinations are offered by the university. The DU will admit 20 per cent extra students for each programme in each college under the General, OBC and EWS categories and 30 per cent in the SC/ST/PwBD categories to fill the maximum number of seats. “To avoid overcrowding in classes, the existing 30 per cent reservation for “extra students” in the SC/ST and person with Benchmark Disability (PwBD) categories will be reduced to 15 per cent in colleges with a withdrawal rate that is below 5 per cent,” they said",

        "content": "RJD leader Rohini Acharya on Tuesday criticized the prevailing law and order situation in Bihar, following the death of a student in Patna stating that the incident underscores the grim reality of ‘Mangal Raj.’ She lamented the apparent impunity granted to wrongdoers, citing instances of mass rapists receiving leniency while innocents face fatal consequences. “What else will happen in the ‘Mangal Raj’? Where mass rapists are patted on the back, innocents are killed. Innocents were killed in my Saran as well, and justice has not been served yet. Now, all the BJP goons are on the run, so we are demanding justice. This time, the public will give a fitting reply to this ‘Mangal Raj’,” Acharya said. Echoing similar sentiments, RJD leader Mrityunjay Tiwari said that the incident is “extremely unfortunate” and criticized the NDA government for failing to ensure safety, especially in educational institutions. “This is an extremely unfortunate incident. When in the capital, Patna such an incident is taking place, this means ‘gunda raj’ is still going on in Bihar. The NDA govt is responsible for this. The administration should look into this matter and make sure that the accused is arrested,” Tiwari said. “How will students coming to Bihar feel safe?” Tiwari questioned, placing responsibility on the administration to arrest the perpetrators. Meanwhile, SP City, Patna East Bharat Soni assured that a special investigation team has been deployed, with one suspect already arrested and others identified. “A special investigation team has been formed by Patna Police in this case. With the coordination of all our teams, we have arrested one accused so far and other accused have been identified. Our team is also trying to make arrests by going to other districts. Another team of ours is engaged in collecting evidence. The cause of death will be known only after the post-mortem,” Soni said. Harsh Raj, a third-year student of BN College, was beaten to death at Sultanganj Law College, where he had gone to take an exam on Monday. According to City SP (East) Bharat Soni, Raj, who was pursuing a vocational English course, was attacked by a group of 10-15 masked individuals upon his arrival. “Harsh Raj was taken to the hospital by his friends after the attack but succumbed to his injuries,” Soni stated. The police have launched an investigation, involving relatives and family members of the deceased. Forensic experts, along with dog squad and technical teams, have been deployed to gather evidence from the scene. While the motive behind the assault remains unclear, initial information from Raj’s friends and family suggests it could be linked to previous disputes. “Harsh Raj was socially active, and there were some issues during his college fest last year that might be connected to this incident,” Soni noted. The investigation is ongoing, and authorities are exploring all possible leads. “We cannot confirm the exact reason for the dispute at this moment,” Soni added, emphasizing the need for a thorough examination of the circumstances surrounding the attack.

        "content": "Abba Voyage: Trailer released for revolutionary concert ABBA legends Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson were interrupted during a Q&A at the second anniversary of the Voyage show at the custom built ABBA Arena in London when a member of the audience had a medical emergency. The legendary duo were answering questions from celebrity guests and fan club members when there was a sudden commotion to the left of the arena. The incident happened around 15 minutes into the session. While the fans were screaming and cheering for the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest winning stars, it took a moment for people to realise that one group of people were actually signalling for help. When the moderator of the chat understood what was going on, he announced the emergency and as soon as the staff realised the situation, they sprang into action. Bjorn stood up from his seat, looking concerned for the person, while a medic rushed through the crowd on the dancefloor. They then brought a wheelchair over to the stricken fan and they were taken care of on site while the show carried on. The whole incident took mere minutes to resolve and once Bjorn and Benny realised the fan was being looked after, they continued with the question and answer session. Guests including Good Morning Britain 's Richard Arnold , Little Britain star Matt Lucas, 80s chart topper Rick Astley, Texas singer Sharleen Spiteri and Absolutely Fabulous legend Joanna Lumley all took a moment to share their queries with the songwriting duo.

We know it’s true, but it’s very hard to understand. Maybe impossible.” Benny agreed chiming in: \"I’ve seen the show so many times and I think we look good up there... \"But I have no idea what it really is that makes people have it in them to want to listen to music that was done 50 years ago, 40 years ago, 30 years ago.” Don't miss...

Read our Privacy Policy “Back in ’79, I don’t think we ever thought about being listened to in 10 years’ time,\" Bjorn confessed when discussing their hit record, Happy New Year. “If you said something like this would happen in 50 years’ time, it would be preposterous, it just doesn’t happen.” Surprisingly, despite their prolific output, the pair have never collaborated with other artists. Although they wrote Elaine Paige and Barbara Dickinson's number one smash hit I Know Him So Well, which was taken from their musical, Chess. However, Benny said he would not rule out future collaborations when asked if they would ever work with someone like Dua Lipa or Lana Del Rey. “I would say I will take a look. We have been asked but never done it.” ABBA Voyage features \"ABBAtars\" of the band performing 21 of the group’s biggest hits alongside a live band and singers, and has already been seen by two million fans.

        "content": "CEBU Governor Gwendolyn Garcia has resigned as member of the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban), citing the tension between her and suspended Cebu City Mayor Michael Rama as the reason behind her decision. In a press conference on Tuesday, May 28, 2024, Garcia said that it was Rama’s complaint filed against her before the Office of the President that prompted her to leave the political party. Rama, in his complaint, petitioned for the suspension of Garcia as Cebu governor. Garcia said Tuesday that she has been a member of the PDP-Laban since 2019, while Rama served as the party's vice president for the Visayas. PDP-Laban was also the political party of former President Rodrigo Duterte. The tension between the two officials started on February 27 when the governor issued a cease-and-desist memorandum, ordering the suspension of the civil works for the Cebu Bus Rapid Transit (CBRT) project phase 1 in front of the Cebu Capitol Building, citing potential heritage violation. Garcia ordered the project's proponent, which was the Department of Transportation, to seek the approval of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines based on the Grade 1 Level Heritage Protection under Republic Act 10066, or the National Cultural Heritage Act of 2009. Garcia said that Rama could have asked for clarification regarding the memorandum, but the mayor instead filed the complaint, expressing his disagreement with the governor's decision. She said that her actions have only upheld the heritage law of protecting the \"Vista Corridor\" of the more than 50-year-old Capitol building in comparison to the modern design of the CBRT project.",

KYSEY has successfully raised ¥30 billion ($191 million) from Japan’s inaugural environmental bond designated solely for nuclear projects, marking a significant milestone for the nuclear energy sector in the country. What Happened : The power company, headquartered in Japan’s southernmost major island, priced a dual-tranche transition bond on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported . The funds are intended to refinance investments in nuclear-related projects, including existing emergency response centers for potential incidents like plane crashes or terrorist attacks. This issuance follows Japan’s commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, which has enhanced the appeal of nuclear energy. Despite the ongoing challenge of identifying new radioactive waste disposal sites, the bond received strong investor interest.

Corporate transition bond sales have been on the rise in Japan since the government’s inaugural sale of such notes in February. The Ministry of Finance recently sold about ¥350 billion of climate transition bonds. Why It Matters : The success of Kyushu Electric’s nuclear transition bond reflects a broader shift in Japan’s energy landscape. In late 2023, Japan’s largest nuclear power plant geared up for a comeback, signaling a renewed interest in nuclear energy. This bond issuance further solidifies the growing importance of nuclear power in Japan’s energy transition. Meanwhile, Japan is also making significant strides in its digital bond market. In December, the country saw its largest digital green bond sale , indicating a broader shift toward sustainable and innovative financing methods in Japan’s financial sector.

        "description": "The Federal MP who has taken the seat of ex-prime minister Scott Morrison has vowed to stand up for middle Australia, saying governments were ignoring them.",
        "content": "Governments are letting down middle Australians and putting the next generation at risk of being worse off than their predecessors, the newest federal MP warns. / (min cost $ 0 ) or signup to continue reading In his first speech to parliament on Tuesday, Liberal MP Simon Kennedy vowed to stand up for the middle class, saying their needs and concerns were being ignored. Mr Kennedy, who replaced former prime minister Scott Morrison in the southern Sydney electorate of Cook, said middle Australia and small businesses remained the heart of the economy. \"Right now, our country is governed for the squeaky wheel, the vested interests, the large corporates with their lobbyists and their megaphones, it's not for the silent majority and definitely not for the small businesses,\" he said. \"The people of Cook don't complain, instead, they get on with things ... it's a microcosm of middle Australia, but rightly, they feel they are being ignored.\" A former consultant with McKinsey, Mr Kennedy ran unsuccessfully for the Liberals at the 2022 election in the marginal seat of Bennelong. He was pre-selected for Cook earlier in 2024 following Mr Morrison's retirement from federal politics, despite controversy over him not living in the electorate. Mr Kennedy said the lack of housing affordability and skyrocketing mortgages were key concerns. \"The promise of the next generation being better off than their parents is disappearing rapidly and it is hard to tell what this could do to Australia's social fabric if allowed to continue,\" he said. \"What used to make our country great is the government got out of the way and allowed middle Australia to build and grow.\" He said federal infrastructure funding should be tied to housing completion rates to boost supply, while industries should be further deregulated for small businesses to grow. Mr Kennedy also hit out at large levels of migration, which he said was impacting the economy. \"Record migration is being used to paper over the weakness of the Australian economy,\" he said. \"The 528,000 new entrants in the country only had 170,000 new homes to choose from. The maths just doesn't work. \"The government and corporate Australia tell us the economy is growing but you and your family are just getting poorer.\" Advertisement Sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.

        "description": "Studies show that wildlife fears 'super predator' more than other predators, with Australian marsupials demonstrating heightened fear and vigilance in response to human sounds.",
        "content": "Wildlife globally perceives 'super predator' as the top threat. Studies have found that wildlife around the world fears humans, the 'super predator', more than other well-known predators like lions, leopards, bears, and wolves. The most recent research in Australia, conducted by Western University and the University of Tasmania, reveals that marsupials in the country are more afraid of humans than they are of foxes and dogs. According to the research paper titled \"Fear of the Human 'Superpredator' in Native Marsupials and Introduced Deer in Australia,\" published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B , Australian marsupials are well aware of the threats humans pose. Researchers investigated the fear response of four native marsupial species (eastern grey kangaroo, Bennett's wallaby, Tasmanian pademelon, common brushtail possum) and a non-native mammal (fallow deer) by exposing them to recordings of predator vocalisations (human, dog, Tasmanian devil, wolf) and non-threatening sounds (sheep). The results were clear: the marsupials were most afraid of humans, fleeing 2.4 times more often than when exposed to any other predator. They were also significantly more vigilant in responding to human sounds. This research adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that wildlife around the world views humans as the top threat. \"These results greatly expand the growing experimental evidence that wildlife worldwide perceives humans as the planet's most frightening predator,\" said Zanette, a renowned wildlife ecologist. \"The very substantial fear of humans demonstrated here and in comparable recent experiments can be expected to have dramatic ecological consequences because other new research has established that fear itself can reduce wildlife numbers and that fear of humans can cause cascading impacts on multiple species throughout entire landscapes.\" Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com As per the press release , to conduct their experiment, the team deployed hidden automated camera-speaker systems that, when triggered by an animal passing within a short distance (approximately 10 metres, or 30 feet), filmed the response to humans speaking calmly, dogs barking, Tasmanian devils snarling, wolves howling, or non-threatening controls, such as sheep bleating. \"Global surveys show humans kill prey at much higher rates than other predators, making humans a'super predator,' and the profound fear of humans being revealed in wildlife everywhere is wholly consistent with humanity's unique lethality,\" said Zanette. \"Humans are 'the invisible killer' insofar as we do not often think of ourselves as a major predator, let alone the most dangerous, but wildlife clearly think differently and recognise us for what we are.\"",
