        "content": "Members of American Legion Post 38 place a wreath near the flag pole at the Mill Springs National Cemetery. The placement of the wreath was part of Monday's Memorial Day services. The dedication of those who have served our country and who have since passed away – in wartime and in times of peace – was honored Monday in a gathering at Mill Springs National Cemetery in Nancy. Those who wanted to pay tribute the men and women who served in the U.S. Military joined American Legion Post 38, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the members of the National Parks Service who oversee the Mill Springs Battlefield and Visitors Center in remembering all those who have gone before us. The ceremony was conducted as part of Memorial Day activities being held at both the National Cemetery and the Civil War-era battlefield. “Hundreds of thousands of Americans have died in preserving liberty and peace for our nation,” said main speaker Allen Boone, retired lieutenant colonel of the U.S. Army. LTC Ret. Allen Boone speaks to the crowd during Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony at Mill Springs. “The Civil War alone had over 700,000 men and women who died in service. Their sacrifices are etched in history, a solemn testament to their bravery and dedication. These men and women understood the meaning of putting others before self. They were dedicated to fulfill their mission at all costs. And as we ponder their sacrifices, our hearts should be filled with gratitude for their willingness to serve against foreign and domestic enemies who sought to destroy our nation,” Boone said. Boone himself has served in active duty, having been in two tours of duty in Iraq. Boone, who currently lives in Lexington, has a masters degree in Management and Leadership from Liberty University and is a graduate of Command and General Staff College. “This day is not just about a day of remembering,” Boone said. “It is time for us to act. As we honor their memory, we pledge that their lives, that their sacrifices, that their valor shall never be forgotten. Let us also pledge to do the utmost and carry out what must, and what they wished for us, in that no other generation of young men and women would have to share their experiences and repeat their sacrifice.” Clarence Floyd, American Legion Post 38 Chaplain, leads the crowd in prayer during Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony at Mill Springs National Cemetery. As part of Monday’s ceremony, American Legion Post 38 Chaplain Clarence Floyd led the crowd in a prayer, in which he said, “As we look across, and as we see all these white markers, Lord, we know that was one of our brothers or sisters, but Lord, they also had a family, and we pray for every one of them and for the life that they lived and for the influence they had on other people.” The ceremony proved bittersweet for Floyd, as he announced he would be retiring as chaplain soon, after 17 years of service with Post 38’s Color Guard. The Color Guard itself bookended the service, by both leading the opening parade which presented the colors, and by completing the service with a 21-gun salute and the playing of Taps. Members of the American Legion Post 38 Color Guard present the colors during the opening parade to Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony. Also during the ceremony, a commemorative wreath was placed at the cemetery’s flag pole, near the grave of Sgt. Brent Woods, a Buffalo Soldier who received the Congressional Medal of Honor after an event in August 1881 in which he saved the lives of his fellow soldiers.",

        "description": "Former South African President Jacob Zuma is the wild card in Wednesday’s election for Africa’s most advanced country. He leads a new political party that's draining support from the ruling African National Congress that he once said would rule until...",
        "content": "DURBAN, South Africa (AP) — The 59-year-old Dumisani Ndlovu has voted in every South Africa national election since he and the rest of the Black majority finally won the right 30 years ago. He has faithfully supported the liberation party-turned-ruling party African National Congress every time. That ends on Wednesday. In a way, nostalgia is calling. Ndlovu in this week's election is turning his support to the man, Jacob Zuma , whose career spanned from the liberation struggle to the presidency before falling out with his ANC colleagues and reemerging last year with a new political party . That MK party, named after the ANC's old armed wing, shows how the 82-year-old Zuma is leveraging the past to rally South Africans' support against the ANC, which he himself once claimed would rule until “Jesus comes back.” Here in the heartland of Zuma supporters, the eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, cab driver Ndlovu has embraced the unlikely comeback of a political survivor after years of corruption allegations, criminal charges and prison. Even being barred from this election as a candidate for Parliament over a recent conviction hasn't blunted Zuma's influence. “They think they have finished him, but we are with him all the way. The ANC will pay,” Ndlovu said. It is a rallying cry that could, for the first time, force the ANC into a coalition to stay in power. The new party is fielding other candidates for Parliament and appears likely to win seats. Zuma has become the wild card of the election for Africa's most advanced country, six years after resigning South Africa's presidency under a cloud. His MK party was formed just over six months ago and yet is expected to drain significant support from the ANC, which already faced its sternest test. Zuma's credentials — he was in prison alongside Nelson Mandela for his work in the anti-apartheid movement — resonate especially in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal. Ndlovu, the cab driver, had backed the ANC since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994. Now, one of his grievances against the ANC is what he calls its ill-treatment of Zuma. “He went to jail during apartheid and then they (the ANC) put him in jail again despite all his sacrifices. What kind of freedom is that?” Ndlovu said. Zuma was sent to prison in 2021 after refusing to testify at an inquiry looking into alleged corruption in government during the time he was president from 2009-2018. He called that sentence an effort by the ANC to silence him. Zuma said last week's Constitutional Court decision to disqualify him from standing as a candidate was part of a grudge against him by the ruling party and the courts. The constitution doesn't allow anyone to stand for election if they have been sentenced to 12 months or more in prison without the option of a fine. “I am going to fight for my rights until this country agrees that freedom must be a complete freedom, not for some and oppression for others,” Zuma said. He now fights under the banner of the MK, which he has fashioned as the vanguard of anti-apartheid struggle ideals such as the distribution of land to Black people. The party’s symbol is similar to the old ANC military wing’s logo. Its full name is uMkhonto weSizwe, which means Spear of the Nation. The ANC took MK to court over its use of the name, which it claims it owns. MK won. It was another example of the ANC trying to silence him, Zuma said. Zuma's new party also looks to the future, promising jobs, free education and better healthcare for young people who make up the majority of the country’s population. They have no memory of apartheid, but they have plenty of grievances about the deep inequality that remains. Zuma claims to be a truer version of the ANC and more dedicated to helping South Africa’s poor Black majority. His party's branding has been welcomed by supporters for its anti-apartheid nostalgia. “I have known uMkhonto all my life. It fought for freedom. It is there for us again this time,” Ndlovu said. How such loyalty — and the ANC's irritation over it — might translate into votes will be seen on Wednesday. “It might just make people want them (MK) more because the question that arises is, why put so much push against this party? There must be there something, and I think people are intrigued and they might just go out and vote for them,” Sanet Madonsela-Solomon, a lecturer in the department of political sciences at the University of South Africa, told TV station eNCA this week. At MK's last major campaign rally over the weekend in KwaZulu-Natal, gray-haired men and women in military fatigues joined youthful supporters sporting skinny jeans and manicured nails. Together, they danced to old anti-apartheid struggle songs that evoked the hardships of that period. They praised late ANC icons like Mandela and criticized current ANC leaders. “uMkhonto is not for the people of KwaZulu-Natal only, it is a calling for South Africa as whole,\" said one attendee, Siboniso Gwala. “The spear is what will liberate this country. uMkhonto will liberate Black people.” His 6-year-old son, Nkanyezi, was in tow, singing along and wearing a beret with MK’s symbol — a warrior with a spear and shield.

        "content": "Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris played Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev and lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. ‘Furiosa’ sneaks past ‘Garfield’ to claim No. 1 spot over Memorial Day holiday weekend Furiosa won the holiday box office over Garfield by a hair. It was a close race, but the wasteland warrior of “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga” came out slightly ahead of the plump orange cat with an estimated $32 million in ticket sales over the four-day weekend according to studio estimates Monday. “The Garfield Movie,” a Sony release, earned $31.1 million in its first four days. This weekend has also been a sobering one for Hollywood as one of the worst Memorial Day weekend box office showings in decades and the gap may only get bigger. Heat-related monkey deaths climb in Mexico, as environmentalists report deaths of birds and bats MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. And an animal park confirmed around a hundred parrots, toucans, bats and more have died apparently of dehydration in northen Mexico. Last week, environmentalists reported 138 of the midsize primates were found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco. The Environment Department reported that number had risen, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. A wildlife biologist said it appeared to be heat stroke. The department said 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released. Chasing cheese wheels or lugging sacks of wool, UK competitors embrace quirky extreme races LONDON (AP) — Dairy-loving daredevils have thrown caution to the wind for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. In Monday's event, dozens of reckless racers chased 7-pound (3 kilogram) wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill since at least 1826. In the nearby town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds (27 kilograms) up and down Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972. They draw on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town. Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. 14-time champion Rafael Nadal loses in the French Open's first round to Alexander Zverev PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That's why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he isn't 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. He reiterated that Monday. He said after his match, \"If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself.” Grayson Murray's parents say the two-time PGA Tour winner died of suicide Grayson Murray’s parents say their 30-year-old son took his own life. Murray died on Saturday, one day after he withdrew from a PGA Tour event at Colonial. Eric and Terry Murray are asking for privacy and that people honor Murray by being kind to one another. His death comes at a time when Murray appeared to be on track with his life and his golf. He has been open about his struggles with mental health and alcoholism. He said when he won the Sony Open in January that he had been sober for the last eight months. Former 'General Hospital' actor Johnny Wactor killed in downtown Los Angeles shooting LOS ANGELES (AP) — Former “General Hospital” actor Johnny Wactor was shot and killed when he interrupted thieves stealing the catalytic converter from his car in Los Angeles. Police say the shooting occurred around 3 a.m. Saturday when the victim approached three men in downtown LA. His mother, Scarlett Wactor, tells ABC 7 that her 37-year-old son had left work at a rooftop bar with a coworker when he saw someone at his car and thought it was being towed. Scarlett Wactor says a mask-wearing suspect looked up and opened fire. Police say three suspects drove away from the scene. Wactor was rushed to a hospital, where he died. 12 people injured after Qatar Airways plane hits turbulence on flight to Dublin LONDON (AP) — Twelve people have been injured when a Qatar Airways plane flying from Doha to Dublin hit turbulence. Dublin Airport said in a statement that the plane landed safely as scheduled before 1 p.m. Sunday. It said six passengers and six crew members reported injuries after the aircraft experienced turbulence while airborne over Turkey. The airport said all passengers were assessed for injuries aboard the plane, and eight were then taken to hospital. The incident comes five days after a British man died of a suspected heart attack and dozens of people were injured when a Singapore Airlines flight from London hit severe turbulence. Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. to miss the rest of the season after tearing his left ACL PITTSBURGH (AP) — Atlanta Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. will miss the rest of the season after he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during an 8-1 victory at Pittsburgh. The reigning NL MVP led off the game with a double to right-center field off Martín Pérez. With Marcell Ozuna at the plate, Acuña started toward third on a stolen base attempt and his left knee gave way. Acuña remained down for several minutes while being treated, pointing at his left leg before walking off under his own power. The Braves’ initial diagnosis was left knee soreness. But the team announced later that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery.",

Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. 14-time champion Rafael Nadal loses in the French Open's first round to Alexander Zverev PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That's why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he isn't 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. He reiterated that Monday. He said after his match, \"If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself.” Grayson Murray's parents say the two-time PGA Tour winner died of suicide Grayson Murray’s parents say their 30-year-old son took his own life. Murray died on Saturday, one day after he withdrew from a PGA Tour event at Colonial. Eric and Terry Murray are asking for privacy and that people honor Murray by being kind to one another. His death comes at a time when Murray appeared to be on track with his life and his golf. He has been open about his struggles with mental health and alcoholism. He said when he won the Sony Open in January that he had been sober for the last eight months. Former 'General Hospital' actor Johnny Wactor killed in downtown Los Angeles shooting LOS ANGELES (AP) — Former “General Hospital” actor Johnny Wactor was shot and killed when he interrupted thieves stealing the catalytic converter from his car in Los Angeles. Police say the shooting occurred around 3 a.m. Saturday when the victim approached three men in downtown LA. His mother, Scarlett Wactor, tells ABC 7 that her 37-year-old son had left work at a rooftop bar with a coworker when he saw someone at his car and thought it was being towed. Scarlett Wactor says a mask-wearing suspect looked up and opened fire. Police say three suspects drove away from the scene. Wactor was rushed to a hospital, where he died. 12 people injured after Qatar Airways plane hits turbulence on flight to Dublin LONDON (AP) — Twelve people have been injured when a Qatar Airways plane flying from Doha to Dublin hit turbulence. Dublin Airport said in a statement that the plane landed safely as scheduled before 1 p.m. Sunday. It said six passengers and six crew members reported injuries after the aircraft experienced turbulence while airborne over Turkey. The airport said all passengers were assessed for injuries aboard the plane, and eight were then taken to hospital. The incident comes five days after a British man died of a suspected heart attack and dozens of people were injured when a Singapore Airlines flight from London hit severe turbulence. Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. to miss the rest of the season after tearing his left ACL PITTSBURGH (AP) — Atlanta Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. will miss the rest of the season after he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during an 8-1 victory at Pittsburgh. The reigning NL MVP led off the game with a double to right-center field off Martín Pérez. With Marcell Ozuna at the plate, Acuña started toward third on a stolen base attempt and his left knee gave way. Acuña remained down for several minutes while being treated, pointing at his left leg before walking off under his own power. The Braves’ initial diagnosis was left knee soreness. But the team announced later that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery.",

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. While Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site. Monday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately. “To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,” he explained, “you need to be playing often.” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

        "content": "Netanyahu acknowledges 'tragic mistake' after Rafah strike kills dozens of Palestinians TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that a “tragic mistake” was made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians. Local officials say at least 45 people were killed in Sunday's strike. It only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel’s military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. At least 21 dead in Memorial Day weekend storms that devastated several US states A series of powerful storms in the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend has killed at least 21 people as they left a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coat later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Biden says each generation has to 'earn' freedom, in solemn Memorial Day remarks WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is marking Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation’s fallen toward creating a more perfect union, “for which they lived, and for which they died.” Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden says each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country’s service members is not in vain. Says Biden: “Freedom has never been guaranteed. Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms in Trump hush money trial WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. Perhaps Wednesday, before the jury begins deliberations, the judge is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case. North Korean rocket carrying its 2nd spy satellite explodes in mid-air SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says its attempt to put another spy satellite into orbit has failed. North Korea’s state media say a rocket carrying the spy satellite exploded midair on Monday evening. Monday’s failed launch came hours after leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. The launch drew rebukes from the North’s neighbors because the U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. At least 2,000 feared dead in Papua New Guinea landslide. These are some challenges rescuers face BANGKOK (AP) — The Papua New Guinea government said more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive in a landslide in the South Pacific island nation. The disaster struck after the side of a mountain came down in the early hours of Friday morning when the village of Yambali was asleep. The settlement is located in a restive and remote area in the interior of the poor, rural nation off the northern coast of Australia, making search and rescue efforts complicated and hazardous. Relations between EU and Israel plummet as Spain, Ireland prepare to recognize a Palestinian state BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel are in a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain. Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz has told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. The EU’s foreign policy chief has thrown his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including Hamas leaders. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030.

Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance.",

        "content": "Netanyahu acknowledges 'tragic mistake' after Rafah strike kills dozens of Palestinians TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that a “tragic mistake” was made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians. Local officials say at least 45 people were killed in Sunday's strike. It only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel’s military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. At least 21 dead in Memorial Day weekend storms that devastated several US states A series of powerful storms in the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend has killed at least 21 people as they left a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coat later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Biden says each generation has to 'earn' freedom, in solemn Memorial Day remarks WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is marking Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation’s fallen toward creating a more perfect union, “for which they lived, and for which they died.” Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden says each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country’s service members is not in vain. Says Biden: “Freedom has never been guaranteed. Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms in Trump hush money trial WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. Perhaps Wednesday, before the jury begins deliberations, the judge is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case. North Korean rocket carrying its 2nd spy satellite explodes in mid-air SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says its attempt to put another spy satellite into orbit has failed. North Korea’s state media say a rocket carrying the spy satellite exploded midair on Monday evening. Monday’s failed launch came hours after leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. The launch drew rebukes from the North’s neighbors because the U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. At least 2,000 feared dead in Papua New Guinea landslide. These are some challenges rescuers face BANGKOK (AP) — The Papua New Guinea government said more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive in a landslide in the South Pacific island nation. The disaster struck after the side of a mountain came down in the early hours of Friday morning when the village of Yambali was asleep. The settlement is located in a restive and remote area in the interior of the poor, rural nation off the northern coast of Australia, making search and rescue efforts complicated and hazardous. Relations between EU and Israel plummet as Spain, Ireland prepare to recognize a Palestinian state BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel are in a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain. Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz has told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. The EU’s foreign policy chief has thrown his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including Hamas leaders. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030. Bill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71 Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year.

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas , with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel's military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. An initial investigation found that the soldier had responded to an exchange of fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants, Egypt’s state-owned Qahera TV reported. Egypt has warned that Israel’s incursion in Rafah could threaten the two countries’ decades-old peace treaty . Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from Israel's strongest supporters. The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images\" from the strike on Rafah \"are heartbreaking.\" It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. \"There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he wrote. The Foreign Office of Germany, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel for decades, said “the images of charred bodies, including children, from the airstrike in Rafah are unbearable.” “The exact circumstances must be clarified, and the investigation announced by the Israeli army must now come quickly,′ the ministry added. ”The civilian population must finally be better protected.” Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. The ICC only intervenes when it concludes that the state in question is unable or unwilling to properly prosecute such crimes. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo.

Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau , who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits , to highlight the importance of honoring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. Biden said that last year the Department of Veterans Affairs delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever before. He credited the PACT Act, which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned,\" Biden said. \"Not anymore.” Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans and Gold Star family members.",

        "content": "An Egyptian soldier was killed during a clash with Israeli troops at a Gaza border crossing on Monday while an Israeli airstrike on Sunday killed at least 40 Palestinians at a camp for displaced people, further inflaming regional tensions over the Israel-Hamas war. Egypt’s military confirmed that a border guard died at the Rafah border crossing on Monday, in bloodshed that threatened to escalate tensions with Israel. Separately, the airstrike at the camp northwest of the Gazan city of Rafah drew international condemnation. Israel acknowledged the death of dozens of people in the strike, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called “a tragic mistake” in an address to the Knesset. Israeli leaders said they were still investigating both incidents. In the border clash, the Israel Defense Forces said “a shooting incident occurred on the Egyptian border,” and that discussions with Egypt were ongoing, without giving any more detail. Israel said the airstrike late Sunday at a Rafah tent community was based on “precise intelligence” and that it killed two “senior” officials from Hamas, designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and European Union. But governments across the world were quick to condemn Israel for the strike. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was “outraged,” while EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said he was “horrified.” The White House said in a statement that images of innocent civilians killed in the strike were “heartbreaking.” “Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,” the National Security Council said in a statement. “But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians.” Israeli troops started operations around the outskirts of Rafah, which lies in southern Gaza, early this month. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will attack the city because it’s the last bastion of Hamas, an Iran-backed Islamist group, and several thousand of its fighters are lodged there. The U.S. and other countries fear mass casualties among the Palestinian civilians in Rafah and have urged Israel to cancel or sharply curtail an assault to prevent harm to innocents. The White House said Monday it was “actively engaging” with the IDF and partners in the region to better assess what had occured. The U.S. and others have also voiced concerns about an Israeli attack on Rafah worsening ties with Egypt. The two Middle Eastern countries signed a peace deal in 1979, which is seen as crucial to Israel’s security. Egypt has been highly vocal of the war in Gaza and consistently called on Israel to agree to a cease-fire. The Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7 when thousands of Hamas fighters crossed into southern Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and abducting 250. Israel’s counterattack has killed some 35,000 Gazans, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. (With assistance from Justin Sink.) ©2024 Bloomberg L.P. Visit bloomberg.com.

        "content": "By: PTI Geneva May 28, 2024 00:30 IST Follow Us Facebook Twitter whatsapp World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday referred to the Global Traditional Medicine Centre set up in India and the first global summit on traditional medicine hosted by the country as he underlined that the year 2023 was a productive one in the UN health agency's work supporting access to medicines and other health products. \"We also established the Global Traditional Medicine Centre in India, and hosted the first global summit on traditional medicine,\" Ghebreyesus said in his remarks as he presented his report to the 77th World Health Assembly in Geneva. In March 2022, the Government of India and the UN health agency had signed an agreement to establish the WHO Global Centre for Traditional Medicine. This global knowledge centre for traditional medicine, supported by an investment of USD 250 million from India, aims to harness the potential of traditional medicine from across the world through modern science and technology to improve the health of people and the planet, the UN health agency had said in a press release at the time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said the agreement between the Ministry of Ayush and WHO to establish the Global Centre for Traditional Medicine (GCTM) - world's first - at Jamnagar, Gujarat, is a commendable initiative. He laid the foundation stone of WHO-GCTM in Jamnagar in April 2022. Speaking on the occasion, Modi had said that the WHO-GCTM is recognition of India's contribution and potential in this field. \"India's traditional medicine system is not limited only to treatment. It is a holistic science of life. India takes this partnership as a huge responsibility for serving the entire humanity.” WHO had convened the Traditional Medicine Global Summit in August last year in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. The summit was co-hosted by India, which held the G20 presidency in 2023. It was held alongside the G20 Health Ministerial meeting. The summit explored the role of traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine in addressing pressing health challenges and driving progress in global health and sustainable development. Ghebreyesus had arrived in Gujarat to attend the global summit on traditional medicine and was accorded a warm welcome. Praising India for its \"rich history\" of traditional medicine like Ayurveda and yoga, Ghebreyesus had stressed the need to integrate this ancient medicinal knowledge into the national health system of countries. \"India has a rich history of traditional medicine through Ayurveda, including yoga, which has been shown to be effective in alleviating pain. The Gujarat Declaration, the main outcome of this summit, will focus on integration of traditional medicines in national health systems, and help unlock the power of traditional medicine through science,\" the WHO chief had said. In his address to the World Health Assembly Monday, Ghebreyesus said 2023 was a year of many challenges, but also of many achievements. He said the year 2023 was a productive one in WHO's work supporting access to medicines and other health products. \"We prequalified 120 medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and other products last year for HIV, malaria, multidrug-resistant TB, Ebola, polio and Covid-19, as well as the first long-acting insulin analogues,” he said. He noted that one of the biggest disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic was to routine immunization programmes in many countries, resulting in backsliding coverage and outbreaks of measles, diphtheria, polio, yellow fever and more. \"In April last year, we launched 'The Big Catch Up' with UNICEF and Gavi, to support countries to shut down outbreaks and restore immunization programmes at least to pre-pandemic levels,” he said. In May last year, the WHO chief had declared an end to both Covid-19 and mpox as global health emergencies. “We continue to call on all countries to maintain and reinforce the capacities for surveillance, detection and response that they built during the pandemic. These investments must not go to waste.” © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd First uploaded on: 28-05-2024 at 00:30 IST Here’s Your Exclusive Pass To Premium Stories CLAIM NOW Deepak Tijori on not asking Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan for help Entertainment May 16, 2024 08:01 IST Deepak Tijori, a veteran actor and filmmaker, spoke about his 30-year journey in the industry and the challenges faced by independent producers.

        "content": "After suffering his earliest-ever defeat at the French Open, a tournament he has won a record 14 times, Rafael Nadal said it is unlikely for him to play at Wimbledon next month, even as he eyes a chance to turn out at the Olympics, taking place at his beloved Roland Garros later this year, one last time. “I can’t confirm anything, but I don’t think it’s smart (to play Wimbledon) after everything my body has been through,” he was quoted as saying by AFP at his post-match press conference. “It will be difficult playing on grass, considering that right after Wimbledon are the Olympic Games.” Nadal, hoping to be competitive in his first round against an in-form opponent, showed invariable signs of rustiness after playing only 15 matches since the start of 2023. He bowed out 3-6, 6-7(5), 3-6 to in-form fourth seed Alexander Zverev. The Spaniard was competitive, especially in the second set which he served for before slumping in the tie-breaker, but Zverev’s shotmaking, fitness and power proved too much to handle. Advertisement READ | French Open: Clay god Rafael Nadal’s exit starts end of unprecedented Roland Garros stronghold Nadal said his body had been through the wringer in recent times. “My body has been a jungle for two years. It has been a big fight, waking up as if a snake or a tiger had bitten me. I need to prepare myself and clear my ideas about a calendar. My main goal is to prepare for the Olympics and to prepare well to be healthy here,” he said, per tennismajors.com, at the press conference. The soon-to-be-38-year-old said he takes positives from Monday’s loss to the German. “My feeling is that I wasn’t that far. I was at a good level (in the match),” Nadal added. “If it was the last time I played here, I would be at peace with myself. I tried to do everything I could to play here. At least I did. Even if I lost, that’s part of the business... I don’t know what’s going to happen in the next few months.” Nadal also had the unusual experience of being watched by active players, in competition at the French Open this year, who were in attendance at Court Philippe Chatrier to bear witness to his potentially final outing. “Happy that it happens, it means that I have a positive legacy here,” he said.",

        "content": "A series of powerful storms swept over the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, killing at least 21 people and leaving a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive, early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, said at a Monday press conference that four people had died in four different counties. The death toll of 21 also included seven deaths in Cooke County, Texas, from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas. Two people died in Mayes County, Oklahoma, which is east of Tulsa, authorities said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. The latest community left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny Kentucky community of Charleston, which took a direct hit Sunday night from a tornado that the governor said appeared to be on the ground for 40 miles (64 kilometers). “It’s a big mess,” said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs, hit by a tornado in 2021. “Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever – no water, no power.” Further east, some rural areas of Hopkins County hit by the 2021 tornado around the community of Barnsley were damaged again Sunday night, said county Emergency Management Director Nick Bailey. “There were a lot of people that were just getting their lives put back together and then this,” Bailey said. “Almost the same spot, the same houses and everything.\" Beshear has traveled to the area where his father grew up several times for ceremonies where people who lost everything were given the keys to their new homes. The visits came after a series of tornadoes on a terrifying night in December 2021 killed 81 people in Kentucky. “It could have been much worse,” Beshear said of the Memorial Day weekend storms. “The people of Kentucky are very weather aware with everything we’ve been through.” More than 500,000 customers across the eastern U.S. were without power Monday afternoon, including about 170,000 in Kentucky. Twelve states reported at least 10,000 outages, according to PowerOutage.us . The area on highest alert for severe weather Monday is a broad swath of the eastern U.S., from Alabama to New York. President Joe Biden sent condolences to the families who had people killed. He said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is on the ground conducting damage assessments and he has contacted governors to see what federal support they might need.. It's been a grim month of tornadoes and severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. Storms killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. The severe thunderstorms and deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. That warm moist air is at the northern edge of a heat dome bringing temperatures typically seen at the height of summer to late May. The heat index — a combination of air temperature and humidity to indicate how the heat feels to the human body — is expected to reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in parts of south Texas on Monday. Record highs are forecast for Brownsville, San Antonio and Dallas. Miami set a record high of 96 F (35.5 C) on Sunday.

Associated Press reporters Acacia Coronado in Austin, Texas, and Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed to this report.",

The visits came after a series of tornadoes on a terrifying night in December 2021 killed 81 people in Kentucky. “It could have been much worse,” Beshear said of the Memorial Day weekend storms. “The people of Kentucky are very weather aware with everything we’ve been through.” More than 500,000 customers across the eastern U.S. were without power Monday afternoon, including about 170,000 in Kentucky. Twelve states reported at least 10,000 outages, according to PowerOutage.us . The area on highest alert for severe weather Monday is a broad swath of the eastern U.S., from Alabama to New York. President Joe Biden sent condolences to the families who had people killed. He said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is on the ground conducting damage assessments and he has contacted governors to see what federal support they might need.. It's been a grim month of tornadoes and severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. Storms killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. The severe thunderstorms and deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. That warm moist air is at the northern edge of a heat dome bringing temperatures typically seen at the height of summer to late May. The heat index — a combination of air temperature and humidity to indicate how the heat feels to the human body — is expected to reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in parts of south Texas on Monday. Record highs are forecast for Brownsville, San Antonio and Dallas. Miami set a record high of 96 F (35.5 C) on Sunday.

        "content": "A series of powerful storms swept over the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, killing at least 21 people and leaving a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive, early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, said at a Monday press conference that four people had died in four different counties. The death toll of 21 also included seven deaths in Cooke County, Texas, from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas. Two people died in Mayes County, Oklahoma, which is east of Tulsa, authorities said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. The latest community left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny Kentucky community of Charleston, which took a direct hit Sunday night from a tornado that the governor said appeared to be on the ground for 40 miles (64 kilometers). “It’s a big mess,” said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs, hit by a tornado in 2021. “Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever – no water, no power.” Further east, some rural areas of Hopkins County hit by the 2021 tornado around the community of Barnsley were damaged again Sunday night, said county Emergency Management Director Nick Bailey. “There were a lot of people that were just getting their lives put back together and then this,” Bailey said. “Almost the same spot, the same houses and everything.\" The December 2021 tornado tore through eight western Kentucky counties, killing 57 people.

        "content": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, the government said, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. Meanwhile, an animal park in northern Mexico confirmed it has received reports that at least a hundred parrots, bats and other animals have died, apparently of dehydration. A heat dome — an area of strong high pressure centered over the southern Gulf of Mexico and northern Central America — has blocked clouds from forming and caused extensive sunshine and hot temperatures all across Mexico. Last week, environmentalists had reported that 138 of the midsize primates, known for their roaring vocal calls, had been found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco since May 16. Almost two-thirds of the country are expected to see highs of 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday. Late Sunday the Environment Department reported that number had risen to 157, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. Wildlife biologist Gilberto Pozo attributed the deaths to a heat stroke, noting a “synergy” of factors — including high heat, drought, forest fires and logging that deprives the monkeys of water, shade and the fruit they eat — appeared to be to blame, while saying a pathogen, disease or other factor can’t yet be ruled out. The department said deaths were occurring in both Tabasco and the neighboring state of Chiapas, and that 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released back into their habitat. The department said some of the monkeys were being treated for dehydration, and that three were in serious but stable condition. But with heat, fires, and deforestation hitting the trees where the howler monkeys live, it was unclear whether even releasing them could ensure their survival. In the northern state of San Luis Potosi, Ena Buenfil, the director of the Selva Teenek eco-park, told The Associated Press on Monday that her facility has been overwhelmed as parrots, bats, toucans have died due to the heat. Buenfil said when the heat wave began in mid-May their clinic to help animals quickly filled up with sick birds and they received a wave of reports by locals finding dead or suffering birds. Because of scarce resources by authorities, Buenfil said the number is likely only a small percentage of the animals affected, but added that their organization has worked with Civil Protection to aid some birds. Buenfil said birds mainly die of dehydration in the heat, and are often disproportionately affected because they don't have anywhere to store water. Meanwhile, bats would become dehydrated sleeping in the beating afternoon heat. She recommended that locals put out bowls of water for animals. “We’ve never seen a situation like what’s happening right now,” she said, adding if they see more heat peaks like this one “there is not going to be much we can do for the animals.” “There are going to be a lot of casualties to the ecosystem if we continue this trend of heat waves in the region,” said Buenfil. Normally quite intimidating, howler monkeys are muscular and some can be as tall as 90 centimeters (3 feet), with tails just as long. Some males weigh more than 13.5 kilograms (30 pounds) and can live up to 20 years. They are equipped with big jaws and a fearsome set of teeth and fangs. But mostly they’re know for their lion-like roars, which bely their size. With below-average rainfall throughout almost all the country so far this year, lakes and dams are drying up , and water supplies are running out . Authorities have had to truck in water for everything from hospitals to fire-fighting teams. Low levels at hydroelectric dams have contributed to power blackouts in some parts of the country.",

        "content": "Plans for a heat network using the Glasgow Recycling and Renewable Energy Centre on Polmadie Road could make “substantial inroads” into reducing carbon emissions in the area. A feasibility study found a network is “technically and economically viable”, council officials have reported. They added the proposal is “commercially attractive enough to engage the private sector’s interest”. It could cost around £24m to build out the network. The report added carbon emissions analysis suggests a 81% reduction is achievable through development of the network, relative to “the continued operation of existing heating systems”. “These savings are estimated with gas boiler back-up over a 40-year assessment period.” A council spokesman said: “How we heat our homes and other buildings is one of the big challenges we face as the city tackles the causes of climate change. “But this study shows conclusively that heat produced by the GRREC can be used to warm buildings across a wide area on Glasgow’s southside. “The heat that comes from household waste processed at the GRREC is fully renewable and would make substantial inroads on the carbon emissions from the buildings in this heat zone area.” The study on a Polmadie district heat network was carried out by consulting engineering firm Buro Happold. It was hoped it would build “confidence that district heat networks are technically and economically viable in locations across the city”. A council report added: “A potential benefit to the GRREC is that heat generation from the waste resource is significantly more efficient than electrical generation, therefore heat supply to a network could significantly improve the overall energy efficiency of the facility.” An image included in the report shows a pipe network linked to Hampden Park, the New Victoria Hospital, Langside Library, Holyrood Secondary School and Cathcart Police Station. It also displays Toryglen Regional Football Centre, Glasgow Clyde College, Mount Florida Primary School and two blocks of flats. The feasibility report proposed that “heat exchange equipment for the EfW supply be sited on the GRREC site, with an energy centre building, housing back-up boilers and thermal storage, on adjacent GCC land”. Council officials added there is “good alignment between the specific heat source at GRREC considered and the demand identified within the core cluster”. A council spokesman said: “The possibility of a district heating network sourced from the GRREC can also help to attract inward investment and create the infrastructure that can support the push for net zero. “The GRREC produces reliable heat and this study shows investors should be confident of a return on any investment. “We are at an early stage with this initiative but we have grounds for optimism that using energy from waste to heat homes and other buildings is realistic and achievable.” Get all the latest news from around the country Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country",

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas , with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel's military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. An initial investigation found that the soldier had responded to an exchange of fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants, Egypt’s state-owned Qahera TV reported. Egypt has warned that Israel’s incursion in Rafah could threaten the two countries’ decades-old peace treaty . Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from Israel's strongest supporters. The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images\" from the strike on Rafah \"are heartbreaking.\" It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. \"There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he wrote. The Foreign Office of Germany, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel for decades, said “the images of charred bodies, including children, from the airstrike in Rafah are unbearable.” “The exact circumstances must be clarified, and the investigation announced by the Israeli army must now come quickly,′ the ministry added. ”The civilian population must finally be better protected.” Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. The ICC only intervenes when it concludes that the state in question is unable or unwilling to properly prosecute such crimes. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "content": "A former manager target for Celtic is set for a mega-money move to Chelsea. Enzo Maresca is set to join the Premier League giants from Leicester City. The Athletic reports that the Championship title winners have given formal permission to the Stamford Bridge side to talk to their head coach. An approach was made by Chelsea on Monday afternoon, with the Italian - Pep Guardiola's former assistant at Manchester City - identified as the top candidate to replace Mauricio Pochettino. And it's said the 44-year-old is expected to agree a bumper five-year contract with the Blues. Maresca only joined the Foxes last summer after deciding to go it alone in the dugout after breaking ties with City. He had been heavily linked with the vacant post in the east end of Glasgow after Ange Postecoglou's departure for Tottenham Hotspur last June. A formal approach was expected to be made by the Hoops for the coach. However, Dermot Desmond instead opted to go after former manager Brendan Rodgers and well, the rest is history. Maresca guided Leicester to an impressive season in the Championship, earning promotion back to the Premier League at the first time of asking. Kieran McKenna - who won promotion with Ipswich Town - was also under consideration by Chelsea chiefs, but Marseca appears to have won that race.

Commentator Gerry McCulloch was having none of Philippe Clement and his assertions that another rebuild is required of his first team at Ibrox. It's just 12 months on from the time that Alfredo Morelos, Ryan Kent and Filip Helander departed Glasgow, with Michael Beale overseeing a huge overhaul of the team before the 2023/24 season.",

        "content": "SHREVEPORT, La. ( ) – Why do people leave coins on top of military gravestones? Similar practices exist in many cultures and have a history stretching back centuries. In modern times, this tradition is a way for service members to honor those who are no longer with us. It also shows the families that someone came to pay their respects and remember their loved ones. According to the , the tradition stretches back to the Roman Empire, where soldiers would insert coins into the mouths of fallen soldiers. The coins enabled them to pay the mythical boatman to take them across the River Styx into the afterlife. The U.S. military adopted the tradition of placing coins on service members’ graves during the Vietnam War. According to the DMA, anti-war sentiment created a charged political climate that could make it difficult to speak with the family members of their fallen comrades. Using the coins provided them a way to pay their respects peacefully. But there’s a deeper meaning behind each coin, depending on which was left at the gravesite. These coins are usually collected from gravesites periodically and used to maintain cemeteries. They can also go toward burial costs for homeless veterans. Another coin often left on the graves of military members is a “challenge coin.” These are small coins or medallions with the insignia of an organization or unit. They’re by their commanders to recognize them for their achievements. Although there are on how to use the coins in a challenge, they are also given as mementos. A service member might leave one on the grave of a person who served in their unit. A similar tradition is also . Although the origins of the ancient practice are unknown, placing small stones and pebbles on a Jewish gravesite signifies a desire to remember and honor loved ones.",

        "content": "The Maharashtra government will not proceed with all the recommendations from the recently proposed Maharashtra State Curriculum Framework for School Education, said State Education Minister Deepak Kesarkar. The framework had stirred a controversy for using lines from Manusmriti as reference in one of the chapters in the draft, a move that Kesarkar clarified had not received governmental or the steering committee’s approval before being made public. Speaking at a press conference in Mumbai on Thursday, Kesarkar expressed regret in excluding Marathi as a compulsory language. “It happened because the draft was made public without following the proper procedure,” he said. Advertisement Kesarkar also said that the exclusion of English as a compulsory language for Class 11 and 12 was “because the government is working to offer higher education in regional languages, including technical education”. After the minister’s clarification, the SCERT issued a press release late Monday stating that Marathi and English language would be compulsory from Class 1 to 10. It also clarified that Hindi, Sanskrit and other Indian and foreign languages are being offered from Class 6, while Classes 11 and 12 students will have to learn two languages — one Indian and the other foreign. Last week, the State Council of Educational Research and Training unveiled the new Maharashtra State Curriculum Framework (SCF), advocating the integration of Indian Knowledge System (IKS) into School Education (SE). It proposed including texts such as the Bhagavad Gita and Manache Shlok — a composition by Samarth Ramdas Swami — for memorisation enhancement through recitation competitions. A chapter on “value education and disposition” from SCF, which aimed at character-building for students, sparked controversy as it began with a Sanskrit verse from Manusmriti, an ancient Hindu legal text describing the social system. This inclusion drew criticism from various quarters regarding the intent behind the decision. Advertisement Kesarkar addressed the issue, stating, “It was an error on the part of the steering committee that placed the draft in public domain without state government approval. The people involved have expressed regret for this. Let me make it clear, the government does not want to propagate any text and will not include any of this in textbooks.” After the matter came to light, several educationists questioned the decision to the Manusmriti reference. “There are numerous Sanskrit verses conveying similar meanings, yet the draft selects one from Manusmriti. This decision appears either politically naive or intentionally provocative, potentially offending certain segments of the society,” said a renowned educationist. While language policy for Classes 3 to 10 lacked clarity; for Classes 11 and 12, English was categorised as foreign language. Chhagan Bhujbal, Maharashtra Cabinet Minister, also expressed concerns, saying the inclusion of Manusmriti in the curriculum could send a wrong signal among Dalits and OBCs. “Such actions could impact us electorally. This initiative must be halted. Though seemingly insignificant now, it could pose future challenges,” Bhujbal said.",

        "content": "With regard to the apparent ecological harm caused by homelessness (“Spring reveals a mess on Anchorage’s trails, and a vexing conversation about homelessness,” ADN, May 19): Contrary to repulsive depictions, homeless people historically leave the smallest ecological footprint. First and foremost, the majority of homeless don’t drive vehicles but walk or take public transportation. The “homeless shuffle” merely consists of cutting a path through the grass leading up to a soup kitchen. Wherein the homeless sit down, eat, get up and walk out empty-handed and with empty pockets. Where’s all the consumerism and trash coming from? There’s a deliberate illustrative demonization of the homeless afoot; organized sabotage of people living outdoors. Actual sabotage coupled with ad hominem attacks against the homeless resulting from too much burning of incense to Herbert Spencer and Ayn Rand is the problem; hence there is no political will to bring about sufficient affordable housing and other services. — Christopher Deile Anchorage Have something on your mind?

        "description": "Netanyahu pushed back at accusations that he has not empowered the negotiating team and that he has preferred to wage an un-winnable war rather than make a deal to return the hostages",
        "content": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the IDF strike that killed 45 Palestinian civilians in Gaza a “tragic mistake” as he vowed never to wave the white flag of defeat as he rejected domestic and international calls to end the war. “Those who say they are exhausted that they are not ready or can not withstand the pressure,” Netanyahu told the Knesset plenum on Monday, “should hold up the white flag of defeat. I will not wave that kind of flag. I will continue to fight until we wave the flag of victory,” he stated. In a brief but rousing speech delivered as the international community increasingly believes that Hamas can not be defeated militarily, Netanyahu vowed to battle on. Opposition leader MK Yair Lapid (Yesh Atid) called on Netanyahu to resign, due to his failed policies, primarily the Hamas-led invasion of Israel on October 7, in which over 1,200 people were killed and another 252 were seized as hostages. “Mr. Prime Minister, why are you still here [in office]?” Lapid said during the 40-signature debate which he initiated. “In what world does the prime minister who is responsible for [October 7] the greatest disaster that has happened to the Jewish people since the Holocaust remain prime minister? In what world do you not come before the plenum, ask for forgiveness from the people of Israel... – and go home?” But when the plenum was asked to vote, 50 of the 120 Knesset members voted to support Netanyahu’s policies, while only 39 backed Lapid’s call for him to quit. Netanyahu defended his efforts to secure the release of the hostages. Although he was able to free 105 of the captives during a deal in November, a second deal has eluded him. A negotiation process, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, has dragged on, without any visible sign of a possible deal, even as high-level talks were held, including in Paris over the weekend between Mossad Chief David Barnea, CIA Director William Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammad Al-Thani. Netanyahu pushed back at accusations that he has not empowered the negotiating team and that he has preferred to wage an unwinnable war rather than make a deal to return the hostages. \"I completely reject the abominable lie, that I do not give the negotiating team the mandate when asked, and do not respond to its requests,” he said. “From the end of December and until now, I received five requests from the negotiating team to expand the mandate, to allow flexible terms, and I authorized all of them,” Netanyahu explained. He blamed the absence of a deal on Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, stressing that he was the “obstacle” to a deal. Night after night television studies repeat false claims and spin about the talks that only harm the families and give Sinwar an excuse not to make a deal, Netanyahu explained. The pressure that should be directed to Sinwar “in whose basements the hostages are kept” is instead being leveled at “the Israeli government.” “Israel is repeatedly asked to make more concessions and more concessions So why should Sinwar get stressed? He is sitting in his bunker, rubbing his hands with pleasure, and is happy that others are doing the work for him,” Netanyahu said. “The pressure directed from home and abroad towards the Israeli government, which is fighting with all its might to return the hostages, only hardens the positions of Sinwar, who demands from Israel surrender conditions that endanger its existence, and therefore we cannot agree to them,” Netanyahu said. The prime minister also spoke of the importance of continuing the Rafah operation, a military campaign that has drawn global condemnation, with the International Court of Justice ordering Israel to halt any military campaign that would destroy the Palestinian group, in whole or in part. The IDF has focused on targeted strikes, killing two high-level Hamas operatives on Sunday night, Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar. The strike, however, set off an explosion into a nearby safe zone for civilians, in which 45 civilians were killed and scores of others were wounded. Netanyahu in describing the incident said, “Despite our best effort not to harm those not involved, unfortunately, a tragic mistake happened last night. We are investigating the incident, we will draw conclusions because this is our policy.” He stressed that separately the IDF had managed to safely evacuate over a million civilians from Gaza.He urged the Israeli public not to listen to the pundits, former politicians, and generals, who painted a false picture of defeat “I hear in the studio the voices of despondency... that say it’s impossible to win.” These voices note the pressure against Israel from the “international community [and] America,” Netanyahu said, as he stressed that he did not plan to be constrained by the global community. “Citizens of Israel, if you want weakness, despondency, surrender – listen to the studios. But if you want power, spirit, and victory – listen to the warriors.,” Netanyahu stated. “The goals of the war, have not changed,” Netanyahu said. “To be victorious over Hamas, return all the hostages, ensure that Gaza won’t pose a threat to Israel, and return the residents of the North safely to their homes.” “These remain our objectives,” he added. “If we surrender, we won’t get all our hostages back. If we surrender, we will give a great victory to terrorism, a great victory to Iran, to its axis of evil, and to all those seeking our destruction,” Netanyahu said. “I am not ready to surrender and fold. I am not ready to end the war before all its objectives are completed. Our heroes did not die in vain.”",

        "description": "The Portland Trail Blazers legend and Hall of Famer died of cancer at the age of 71, the NBA announced Monday.",
        "content": "PORTLAND, Ore. — People across the basketball world are sharing their memories of Portland Trail Blazers and NBA legend Bill Walton, who died of cancer at the age of 71. Walton, considered one of the best players in Trail Blazers history, led Portland to its lone NBA championship in 1977 and was named Finals MVP. He won a second championship in 1986 with the Boston Celtics, his final full season in the league. Walton was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993. He was also beloved for his work as a sportscaster after his playing career and his life-long work as an advocate for social and political issues (and the Pac-12). Here are some of the reactions from the NBA world: Adam Silver , NBA commissioner: \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events -- always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered. As a cherished member of the NBA family for 50 years, Bill will be deeply missed by all those who came to know him and love him. My heartfelt condolences to Bill's wife, Lori; his sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris; and his many colleagues and friends.\" Julius Erving , NBA legend and Hall of Famer: \"I am sad today hearing that my comrade & one of the sports worlds most beloved champions & characters has passed. Bill Walton enjoyed life in every way. To compete against him & to work with him was a blessing in my life. Sorry for your loss Walton family. We’ll miss him too. Doc\" I am sad today hearing that my comrade & one of the sports worlds most beloved champions & characters has passed. Bill Walton enjoyed life in every way. To compete against him & to work with him was a blessing in my life. Sorry for your loss Walton family. We’ll miss him too. Doc pic.twitter.com/GAEt1DRH8N Magic Johnson , NBA legend and Hall of Famer: \"Rest in peace to a friend, 2X NBA Champion, Hall of Famer, and one of the most skilled centers we’ve ever seen Bill Walton! His NCAA Championship performance as a UCLA Bruin against Memphis is by far the most dominate NCAA Championship performance ever - he shot 21 for 22 and had us all mesmerized! That’s when I first fell in love with his basketball game. They talk about Jokic being the most skilled center but Bill Walton was first! From shooting jump shots to making incredible passes, he was one of the smartest basketball players to ever live. Bill was a great ambassador for college basketball and the NBA, and he will be sorely missed. Cookie and I send our condolences and prayers to his wife Lori, kids Luke, Nathan, Chris, and Adam, and all of his loved ones.\" Ron Wyden , Oregon senator: \"Bill Walton brought Rip City our greatest on-the-court thrills by leading the Trail Blazers on a magical run to the title in 1977. And for decades after his playing days, he brought an entire nation his good nature on life and basketball. I will miss my friend Bill dearly.\" Daryl Morey , Philadelphia 76ers executive: \"RIP Bill Walton - my favorite example of his endless commitment to helping others is when he stepped in to assist the Lithuanian national basketball team as they broke away from the Soviet Union before facing the original Dream Team in 1992.\" RIP Bill Walton - my favorite example of his endless commitment to helping others is when he stepped in to assist the Lithuanian national basketball team as they broke away from the Soviet Union before facing the original Dream Team in 1992 pic.twitter.com/eZVtBZMOBX Los Angeles Clippers : \"We have lost one of the greatest players and personalities that this franchise, this sport and this region have ever known. Bill Walton is synonymous with Southern California basketball: a San Diego native, a UCLA phenom, a Clipper icon. He defined the game as a player, a broadcaster and an ambassador, spreading joy for generations. Wherever he went, whatever he did, Big Red stood above the crowd. The Clippers organization extends our deepest condolences to the Walton family, as well as our utmost gratitude. Bill was a singular force, and we were privileged to know him.\" Pac-12 Conference : \"The Pac-12 is and will forever be the Conference of Champions not because of trophies or medals, but because of the amazing individuals, champions in life, who compete in this league and cement legacies of excellence. There is no better example of this 'Conference of Champions' spirit than Bill Walton. We are heartbroken and devastated to learn of Bill's untimely passing. We offer our sincere condolences and thoughts of love to Bill's family and the entire Pac-12, UCLA Bruins and basketball communities. Bill's list of accomplishments on the court, as massive as they are, are only outweighed by the quality of his character and beauty of his one-of-a-kind loving spirit.\" Sam Amick , longtime NBA reporter: \"Thoughts and prayers to the Walton family and legions of friends that the legendary Bill Walton made in his 71 years. He was larger than life in every sense, and sharing his positive energy and humor until the end.\" Marc Stein , longtime NBA reporter: \"Such incredibly sad news. Bill Walton was one of the most magnetic, engaging, basketball-loving personalities I ever encountered covering this game. He will be so, so, SO missed. Most heartfelt wishes to his son Luke, their whole family and everyone who knew and loved Bill.\" Kevin O'Connor , longtime NBA reporter: \"RIP Bill Walton.

Condolences to his family.\" John Hollinger , former NBA team executive, current NBA reporter: \"Bill Walton was 1 of 1. Always passionate about the game, always had a warm greeting for everyone he saw in the arena - even people like me that he barely knew. What a sad day for basketball.\" Chris Vernon , NBA podcast host: \"RIP Bill Walton. One of my absolute favs. He wrote this letter to my son. Will treasure it forever.\" RIP Bill Walton. One of my absolute favs. He wrote this letter to my son. Will treasure it forever. pic.twitter.com/m8LY3psZnx Mike Barrett , former Trail Blazers broadcaster: \"Had an intense love for life. Happy and peaceful, seemingly always. Always made you feel important and honored. What a gift he was, and what a legacy he leaves.\" Casey Holdahl , longtime Trail Blazers team reporter: \"I wrote a dumb story (my specialty) about players wearing shorter shorts, so I figured I'd reach out to Bill not expecting I'd hear back. Bill ended up talking for an hour (his specialty) with complete sincerity about the virtues of short shorts. And that really encapsulates Bill. Never too big or serious to make you feel silly or small. Always made you feel important because of the time he was willing to give you. Willing to be vulnerable in ways most people avoid at all costs.\" Danny Marang , Portland radio host, host of Jacked Ramsays podcast: \"I remember in my earliest years not liking Walton on game calls. Then, I grew to love his love and appreciation for the people and the game. 'Throw it down, big man!' become one of my favorite calls. Man, this sucks. RIP to a true 1 of 1. No one will ever do it like he did.\" Orlando Sanchez , KGW sports anchor and reporter: \"Heartbreaking to hear the passing of the legendary Bill Walton. One of a kind. Got the opportunity to chat with him a few times over the years. My favorite line of his was, \"I'm the luckiest guy in the world.\" Condolences to his family and loved ones. RIP to a legend.\" Jay Allen , former on-air TV and radio host/reporter for the Trail Blazers: \"Devastated to hear the news of Bill Walton's passing. Through my work with KXL and the Blazers, I had the honor of dining in and broadcasting from his San Diego home. One of my cherished memories of Bill was picking him up at PDX before a Fred Meyer remote. We had some extra time so he asked me to take him to Multnomah Falls. As we walked the trail up to the bridge, people stopped us every few moments to thank him, ask for a picture or autograph, or just say hello. He was patient and gracious with each fan. I will never forget the kindness and generosity he showed me over the years. My condolences to his wife, Lori, and his family. #RIPbigredhead\" Ian Karmel , famous comedian and Blazers fan: \"I'm not sure who is the greatest Blazer of all time, but Bill Walton is the most Blazer of all time. ... This is of course very sad, and especially sad for the people who knew him and aren't just fans from afar like me... but imagine being on your death bed looking back at THAT life. He really went out and did it.\" Dave McMenamin , ESPN NBA reporter: \"We get caught up in 'greatness' conversations about NBA players ad nauseam - Who’s the GOAT? Is this guy better than that guy? Would that guy's game translate to this era? Take some time to read the tributes pouring in about Bill Walton today. That's true greatness.\" Chris Vannini , The Athletic senior writer: The best of Bill Walton on commentary: pic.twitter.com/MqwNQZj2dg This story will be updated with more reactions as they continue to come in.

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of the league’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times’ bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.” It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me.

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of the league's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times' bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.\" It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” He also considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He considered Bill Russell his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth.

        "description": "Wojciech Soczewica, director general of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation, noted the project's responsibility to preserve the authenticity of the site while making educational content accessible.",
        "content": "Google has announced a $1 million grant to support the development of the \"Auschwitz in Front of Your Eyes\" project through its philanthropic arm, Google.org. The initiative aims to deepen awareness and knowledge about , reaching additional audiences worldwide through a live-streamed virtual tour. The project enables people unable to physically visit the camp, including those in remote locations, to engage with the history of Auschwitz. The virtual tour, conducted by a guide, includes , multimedia materials, and interactive opportunities for participants to ask questions. \"The funding will help develop the technological platform and its accessibility, including real-time subtitles, AI-based translation into multiple languages, and the digitization of survivor testimonies,\" said Rowan Barnett, for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. \"This support will also provide comprehensive training for guides and enhance the capacity to bring such visits to large communities worldwide, including partnerships with schools to educate more students about the Holocaust.\" The online guided tour program, \"Auschwitz in Front of Your Eyes,\" was recently launched by the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum. This innovative initiative provides a virtual visit to the former German Nazi concentration and extermination camp. The two-hour tour is divided into two parts: Auschwitz I and Birkenau. Educators conduct the tours live, utilizing multimedia materials, archival photographs, artistic works, documents, and testimonies of survivors. Group tours are available in seven languages: English, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Polish, and Spanish. Individual tours are offered in English, German, and Polish. Bookings can be made through visit.auschwitz.org. \"This form of visit differs from on-site tours primarily because, in the online version, we do not present the museum exhibitions,\" said Tomasz Michaldo, project coordinator at the Museum. \"Technology allows us to somewhat transfer the content of the exhibition to the historical site, as many things can be additionally shown on the screen. During the online tour, it will be possible, thanks to video recordings, to enter several spaces that are either not accessible to visitors, such as Block 10 in the former Auschwitz I camp, or are located too far from the regular tour route, such as the Sauna building in the former Auschwitz II-Birkenau camp.\" Dr. Piotr M. A. Cywiński, the director of the Auschwitz Museum, emphasized the importance of making the Memorial and its resources accessible globally to confront issues related to antisemitism, racial hatred, and societal threats. \"Our mission is to commemorate the victims and preserve this universal memory, on which we have built and continue to build our post-war identity. Although thousands of people visit the authentic site every day, this unique technology will enable us to reach people in the most remote corners of the world,\" he said. \"We hope that this will strengthen the memory that actually gives us the power to act responsibly for the repair of the world, making it a better place for our children and grandchildren.\" The online platform is a collaborative effort between the Museum, the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation, and companies such as AppsFlyer and DISKIN. Wojciech Soczewica, director general of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation, noted the project's responsibility to preserve the authenticity of the historical site while making educational content accessible worldwide.

        "content": "Adrienne McGuinness provided a false alibi for infamous killer ‘Cotton Eye’ Joe Delaney Adrienne McGuinness turned up a stereo to drown out murder victim Mark Dwyer’s screams Election candidate Malachy Steenson Adrienne McGuinness at an anti-immigration protest Adrienne McGuinness at and anti-immigration protest ‘Cotton Eye’ Joe Delaney A woman who initially gave a false alibi for a notorious gangland killer in a murder investigation is part of the campaign team for an anti-immigrant candidate in the upcoming elections. Adrienne McGuinness, a prominent anti-immigrant protester from East Wall in Dublin, initially lied for ‘Cotton Eye’ Joe Delaney to give him an alibi for the brutal torture and murder of Mark Dwyer over missing drugs in 1996. McGuinness, who was present in the Co Kildare home where Dwyer was being tortured and turned up the stereo to drown out his screams, was arrested by gardaí in connection with the killing and gave Delaney an alibi saying she had been having an affair with him and slept with him that night. However, she later agreed to testify against Delaney in court and said she had given him the false alibi as she had been frightened of him. Election candidate Malachy Steenson She said she booked into a hotel with Delaney in the aftermath of the killing after she received death threats from a man purporting to be from the INLA over alleged drug pushing and had been given seven days to leave the country. McGuinness is now campaigning for Independent European and local election candidate Malachy Steenson, who in the 1990s was a fringe republican and anti-drug activist who had been targeted by Garda Special Branch and has a conviction from the Special Criminal Court. The pair have found common ground in recent times due to their shared anti-immigration views and have been part of a campaign against the housing of asylum seekers in East Wall in Dublin. Last year, the Sunday World revealed that McGuinness — who previously described refugees as “scammers bleeding us dry” — had a compensation claim thrown out of court because she had failed to disclose previous accidents. Adrienne McGuinness at an anti-immigration protest McGuinness had been awarded €175,000 in compensation over a number of years as a result of various accidents. However, last October she was unsuccessful in a €60,000 claim in Dublin Circuit Civil Court in relation to a minimal-impact car crash which she said left her with a sore neck. Judge Sinéad Ní Chúlacháin told McGuinness she had no option but to throw out her latest claim because she had given evidence of two accidents that she had failed to disclose earlier. Steenson has been linked to various political groups over the years, including the Workers Party and Republican Sinn Féin. Adrienne McGuinness at and anti-immigration protest In 1994, Garda Special Branch raided Steenson’s home in an operation targeting fringe figures linked to Republican Sinn Féin – an anti-peace process republican splinter group. Four years later, in 1998, he lost a court bid to get a licence to drive a hackney after an appeal to Dublin District Court. The carriage office had previously rejected his application for a public service vehicle licence as he had three convictions, including one at the Special Criminal Court for unauthorised taking of a vehicle. Steenson was also a friend of Alan Ryan, who was shot dead after a feud with gangland criminals in 2012. He spoke out after Ryan’s death and later said he did so because Ryan was dealing with drug dealers in society and “the state wasn’t willing to do that”. ‘Cotton Eye’ Joe Delaney While Steenson was part of anti-drug movements in Dublin in the 1990s, he also defended a drug dealer whose home was marched on by local residents. Steenson publicly defended Brendan ‘Fats’ Reilly, saying he was an addict but not a dealer. Reilly was later jailed after being caught with £30,000 of heroin at his home. Meanwhile, McGuinness is not the only anti-immigrant campaigner who was present during Mark Dwyer’s torture. Delaney’s son Scott Delaney , who helped abduct Dwyer before he was tortured and killed by his father, is also part of anti-immigrant protests.",

        "description": "White House response less critical than others issued after similar incidents throughout the war, says 'Israel has right to go after Hamas, but must take every precaution'The post US laments ‘devastating’ Rafah strike, urges Israel to better protect civilians appeared first on The Times of Israel.",
        "content": "The US on Monday lamented the “devastating” and “heartbreaking” images from an IDF missile strike carried out the previous night, which targeted two senior Hamas officials, but also reportedly killed dozens of displaced Palestinian civilians sheltering in tents in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. “Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians, but, as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians,” said a statement from a National Security Council spokesperson. While the White House indicated a degree of disappointment with Israel over the high civilian toll, its statement was notably less critical than previous dressing-downs that the Biden administration has not shied away from giving in recent months. “We are actively engaging the IDF and partners on the ground to assess what happened,” the spokesperson added, indicating that the White House may have more to say on the matter after more information is gathered. In April, after an IDF strike killed seven humanitarian workers, US President Joe Biden said he was “outraged” by the attack and threatened to fundamentally shift his policy in the Gaza war if Israel did not take significant steps to improve the desperate humanitarian situation in Gaza. Earlier this month, Biden warned that he would halt certain offensive weapons shipments to Israel if it launched an offensive in the population centers of Rafah. Two US officials told the Axios news site on Monday that the White House was still assessing whether Sunday’s strike violated that red line set by Biden. Just last week, the White House indicated its satisfaction with Israel’s shifting from its initial Rafah plans to a more limited operation. Sunday’s strike drew fiercer condemnations from the European Union, the United Nations, Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, France, and others, who called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Israel acted relatively quickly to acknowledge wrongdoing, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying, “Despite our efforts not to harm [civilians], there was a tragic mishap. We are investigating the incident.” The airstrike in the Tel Sultan area of western Rafah targeted and killed the commander of Hamas’s so-called West Bank headquarters — charged with advancing attacks against Israel in and from the West Bank — as well as another top member of the unit. Hamas health authorities said some 45 people were killed in the strike, which also engulfed several tents and shelters where thousands of people were taking shelter in the area — many of whom after having been repeatedly displaced due to the war. The IDF said that an independent military body responsible for investigating unusual incidents during the war will probe the Sunday night strike. The army said it carried out the attack after receiving intelligence that senior Hamas commanders Yassin Rabia and Khaled Najjar were in the area. It claimed that it took “many steps” to reduce civilian harm and believed that non-combatants would be protected. A military source said that two missiles with a “reduced in size” warhead, which were adapted for such targets, were used in the strike. The IDF added that the strike did not take place in the designated “humanitarian zone” in the al-Mawasi region on the coast, where the military has called Palestinians to evacuate to in recent weeks. Palestinians say that the zone is completely overcrowded, forcing them to find adjacent areas to shelter. The war in Gaza erupted after Hamas’s October 7 massacre, which saw some 3,000 terrorists burst across the border into Israel by land, air and sea, killing some 1,200 people and seizing 252 hostages amid acts of brutality and sexual assault. Roughly 36,000 Palestinians have been killed and 80,420 have been injured in the Israeli military offensive against Hamas since October 7, according to the Gaza health ministry run by the terror group. These figures have not been verified and only some 25,000 fatalities have been identified at hospitals. The tolls include some 15,000 terror operatives Israel says it has killed in battle. Israel also says it killed some 1,000 terrorists inside Israel on October 7. Emanuel Fabian contributed to this report.",

Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread by Katie Bohn, Pennsylvania State University Teachers and other child educators can benefit from regular professional development, but in-person training can be expensive. New research found that virtual training can be a budget-friendly alternative—and especially effective for certain groups of educators. The study—a collaboration between researchers at Penn State and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and published in the International Journal of Professional Development, Learners and Learning —found that educators who took a virtual training reported feeling more confident in their abilities to implement practices shown to support positive youth development. In particular, after-school providers who did not have a four-year degree and were relatively new to teaching experienced the most growth in their feelings of self-efficacy. Co-author Benjamin Bayly, assistant professor in family studies , child, and youth development in the College of Agricultural Sciences, said the work suggests that virtual professional development has the potential to be an effective way to reach a vast audience of educators who otherwise may not have the opportunity to participate in these trainings. \"Early care and education programs are often limited in financial resources and their workforce is often stretched thin, making it difficult to participate in professional development,\" Bayly said. \"Virtual professional development represents an alternative that is low cost and can be completed on teachers' own time.\" Education quality has a direct impact on children's development, the researchers said, and has been shown to predict future academic success and social and emotional well-being for children of all ages. For teachers and other educators to provide high-quality educational experiences, the researchers said it's important they are trained in and feel confident implementing the most up-to-date pedagogical theories and best practices in their classrooms. This can be achieved through professional development, traditionally completed in person. For example, an early care and education program may bring in an outside expert to conduct a workshop with the aim of improved instructional and emotional support in the classroom. \"However, given the high rate of turnover in early care and education programs , these teachers may leave and be replaced by new teachers who have not completed the workshop,\" Bayly said. \"It may not be feasible for the program to continuously bring in an outside expert to train teachers every time new teachers come on board.\" As an alternative, training can be done in an online setting. Penn State Extension, for example, offers virtual evidence-informed professional development to early care and education and youth-development professionals to improve the quality of their care and educational practices through its program, Better Kid Care. \"All of Better Kid Care's courses are on-demand, meaning professionals can take the course whenever they want,\" Bayly said. \"The vast majority of the courses offered by Better Kid Care are designed to take two hours and are approved for professional development credits in 49 states.\" But while virtual training can reach a larger audience and be more cost effective than in-person professional development, research on its effectiveness has remained mixed. Bayly said he and the rest of the research team wanted to better evaluate the impact of virtual training and whether certain groups may benefit more than others. For the study, the researchers collected data from 3,535 educators accessing positive youth development courses through Better Kid Care. Educators varied in their specific roles, the ages of children they worked with, the level of their own education and how many years of experience they had. After completing the virtual course, educators completed a post-test that asked them questions about what they had just learned, as well as how they would have responded to those same questions before taking the training. This was designed to assess changes in the participants' learning. Participants also were asked to rank how confident they felt in their ability to apply learnings from the course, for example, \"When working with children and youth, I can recognize their individual differences and make changes to activities to meet these differences.\" Taken together, the researchers said the study's findings suggest that on-demand professional development is a promising way to increase educators' self-efficacy, but the courses may have different impacts depending on factors such as education level, role and experience. Bayly said after-school providers without a four-year degree appear to have benefited the most from the virtual training because they were relatively new to the field and likely had not received a comparable amount of training compared to the other educators who completed the course. \"Also, because the courses were dedicated to supporting positive youth development , it is likely that the content resonated with them, which has been shown to impact participants' engagement and the effectiveness of the professional development opportunity,\" Bayly said. The researchers said because there is great variability in the quality of virtual professional development—and as a result, great variability in the effectiveness of the trainings—additional studies should continue to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual professional development, both on its own and in comparison to in-person professional development and hybrid models.

        "description": "Vancouver artist Sang Chul Nam displays his latest work at Fort Langley Community Hall June 1 to 9",
        "content": "A contemporary Vancouver artist with a high-tech show is taking over a new art exhibition space in the historic Fort Langley Community Hall next month. “Hacking the Third Wave II” runs 10 days, colliding past and future in the former-library-space-turned-art-gallery, which is located on the ground floor of the hall. Earlier this year, the long-time Fort Langley Library was temporarily relocated to the former centennial museum space on King Street, consequently vacating the 900-plus-square-foot space, while the library waits to move into its permanent home in the salishan Place by the River cultural centre currently under construction nearby. In the meantime, the vacant area of the hall has been transformed and since dubbed the “Olde Library Space.” It will now be used for art opportunities, said Brigitte Seib, executive director of the community hall. Fort Langley Artist Group (FLAG) was the first to use the space for a four-day pop-up show during the May Day long weekend, and that exhibition will be followed this coming week by a Fort Gallery show, running from June 1 to 9. “Hacking the Third Wave II” was created by multi-media artist Sang Chul Nam and features cosmic paintings, sculptures, and projections—immersing viewers in what he calls a world of possible futures. Nam is a visual and new media/interactive artist exploring the boundaries between visual art and technology in Seoul and Vancouver. For the past 17 years, Nam’s work explored the emotional, interactive, and formative space made through the movement of light – and the combination of painting, objects, video installation, and physical computing. He has displayed his work in numerous exhibitions in Hong Kong, South Korea, plus some 20 other cities around the globe – including Langley. Recently, his interest has shifted towards conveying the message of climate change and the unsettling impact of global warming on the environment. He tries to channel this concern through media and interactive art forms that orchestrate the movement of lights and artificial objects with human interactions. Nam’s latest show explores people’s multifaceted relationship to nature in an increasingly manufactured and technological age. He’s creating a space where he hopes viewers will grapple with the many forms of change facing climate and local ecologies. What he calls a “hopeful and critical” body of work, this exhibit was developed in response to his experience of working as an artist in Seoul. He said he was “saturated with technology to such a degree that he felt his own consciousness and behavioural patterns changing like a machine... trapped in patterns of ‘replication,’ ‘repetition,’ and ‘computation’.” When he relocated to Vancouver, he had a contrasting experience, surrounded by abundant natural spaces. This prompted Nam to explore the question: “what will the world of the future look like if our consciousness is controlled by technological properties, patterns, or behaviours and doesn’t feel the beautiful, emotional waves that come from nature?” Entering the historic community hall space, viewers will encounter abstract paintings and kinetic geometric sculptures, overlaid with projected patterns and interactive lights. Multiple screens will be suspended and layered throughout the space, immersing viewers in “a powerful interplay of organic and artificial elements.” Viewers are invited into a dual investigation of their relationship to nature and technology, as Nam illuminates both the “benefits humans derive from nature and the concerns surrounding the contradictory impacts of technological progress on the environment.” The exhibit is open June 1, 2, 7, 8, and 9, from noon to 4 p.m., and also available for viewing by appointment June 3 through 6. Appointments can be booked via email at . There will also be an artist talk and opening reception held Saturday, June 1, starting with the talk at 2 p.m. and the reception to follow. All events are free and open to the public. Fort Gallery is in its second season of its pop-up programming. Fort Gallery was founded in 2006 as an artist co-op to provide a space for experimental, non-commercial art practice in the Langley area. In 2019 the co-op was dissolved and Fort Gallery became the first and only artist-run-centre in the Fraser Valley. In 2022, after 17 years exhibiting contemporary art in its heritage Fort Langley storefront at the corner of Glover Road and Francis Street, Fort Gallery moved out of this beloved space to begin a new venture as a mobile artist-run-centre. Responding to growing online engagement and the challenge of maintaining a physical gallery in a post-COVID world, the board determined that going mobile was a way to embrace experimentation and reimagine Fort Gallery. Fort Gallery continues hopes to continue bringing engaging, challenging, and thought-provoking contemporary art to the Fraser Valley in alternative and public spaces throughout the region, said board president Alysha Creighton.",

        "content": "EASTENDERS fans think they've worked out the 'real reason' for Nish Panesar's bombshell after he made a shock return to Albert Square. Tonight's episode of EastEnders saw Suki Panesar [ Balvinder Sopal ] left terrified when ex-husband Nish [ Navin Chowdhry ] turned up months after fleeing Walford . He initially appeared to be delivering the news that their divorce was finalised, leaving Suki and girlfriend Eve Unwin [Heather Peace] shaken by his sudden arrival. They later had the locks changed but Nish found his way back into the house and asked Suki to call a family meeting. When his sons Ravi [ Aaron Thiara ] and Vinny [ Shiv Jalota ] turned up they were less than impressed. As Ravi attempted to remove Nish from the family home, he dropped the bomb that he is dying. However fans rushed to social media to speculate on Nish's return and his shock news. One wrote: \"He's trying to get back into his family's good books.\" Viewers will remember Nish was run out of town by the family in February after he was caught attacking Suki. Another said: \"Does he genuinely expect his family to forgive and forget?\" \"Nish is definitely up to something. He's had months to plot his revenge.\" And a third added: \"There's a very big chance Nish is lying.\" THE beloved British soap has been captivating audiences for decades. EastEnders follows the lives of the residents of Walford as they navigate love, loss, family drama, and community struggles. Here's the latest on:",

        "description": "Mr Fagbemi said the call for the transfer of the conduct of local government elections to INEC is fueled by the perception that state electoral commissions are appendages of incumbent governors. The post Why there’s growing agitation for scrapping of SIECs — AGF appeared first on Premium Times Nigeria.",
        "content": "The Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi, has said there is a strong call for the scrapping of the state electoral commissions because of their abuse by governors. Mr Fagbemi said the call for the transfer of the conduct of local government elections to INEC is fueled by the perception that SEIC are appendages of incumbent governors. The AGF spoke on Monday at the national dialogue organised by the House of Representatives at the Sheraton Hotel in Abuja. The dialogue was titled; Nigeria’s Security Challenges and Good Governance at the Local Government Level. Under the 1999 constitution, SIECs have the mandate to conduct elections in the 768 local governments in the 36 states of Nigeria, while INEC is responsible for the six area councils in Abuja and other elections. Over the years, the inability of the SIECs to conduct free, fair and credible elections has led to calls for reforms. In many states, ruling parties in the states win all elections, while many states are operating caretaker committees. In his speech, Mr Fagbemi said the perceived lack of independence by the electoral commissions is fueling the call for the shift.

Their functions and powers should be transferred to the independent national electoral commission because the state independent electoral commissions remain an appendage to every incumbent governor. “This is perceived as the root cause of the problem of local government administration in Nigeria,” he said. However, the minister did not state if the executive was going to adopt the option, nor did he provide the stance of the government on the proposal by the experts. To make the change, the constitution has to be amended. The process is currently going on in the two chambers of the National Assembly. Mr Fagbemi said the constitution did not provide adequate political autonomy for the states, hence the abuse by state governments. He explained that the failure of the constitution is to blame for the subjugation of the local governments by states. “The 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria did not provide adequately for the political autonomy of the local governments. The resultant effects of these inadequacies are that the state governments have the discretion to determine the nature, content and direction of local government elections and political activities. “The failure of the constitution to articulate a clear line of authorities to both the state and local authorities and the continuing debate over the involvement of state governments in distributing local government allocation from the Federation Account has affected the capacity of LGAs to provide essential services at the grassroots,” he said. Speaking further, the AGF said that most local governments operate “as an appendage of the state governments” due to the constitution. He added that “the constitutional provisions on State Joint Local Government Account (section 162 (5-8)) have placed the local government councils in a political bondage.” Mr Fagbemi said many state governors do not conduct elections rather they select preferred candidates. “Politically, due to the flaws in the electoral process in the country, what is obtained is a virtual selection and not the election of local government functionaries. Local government chairmen are always imposed on the people by the state governors,” he said. Mr Fagbemi proposed some recommendations to address the problems facing local governments in Nigeria, stating that there is a need to amend the 1999 constitution to address the anomalies. “LGAs are created by the constitution. Accordingly, in a tiered system like ours, a constitutional amendment is imperative before a new system of local government administration can be instituted. “Good governance at any level of governance is not possible without the transfer of authority, responsibilities, capacity and resources. This is even more so for the LGAs. He stated that the reforms should, among other things, aim to increase the fiscal and administrative autonomy of the local government system to enhance its effectiveness and efficiency; Mr Fagbemi also said, “Fiscal autonomy should be balanced with fiscal restraint by strengthening the internal controls system, processes and infrastructure for public financial management.” In addition, the minister said the legislative arms of local governments should be allowed to decide what they should do with revenue accruing to them. He said there is a need to invest more in local government administration with institutionalised internal and external oversight. PREMIUM TIMES reported that the AGF, on behalf of the federal government, filed a suit at the Supreme Court against the 36 state governments, seeking the enforcement of full autonomy of the local governments in Nigeria. Governors have a history of opposing any form of reform of the local government system. Most constitutional alteration bills on reforms are blocked by them. In December 2022, former President Muhammadu Buhari accused the state governors of pilfering local government funds. PREMIUM TIMES reported how state governors rose against a move by the NFIU to abolish the states’ local governments’ joint accounts through which governors allegedly exercised absolute control over local governments’ funds in the country. The NFIU placed a limit on cash withdrawals from local government accounts to a maximum of N500,000 per day. It warned banks to ensure strict compliance. Last December, the Nigerian Senate asked the federal government to stop the allocation of funds to local governments run by caretaker committees.

        "content": "ABUJA – The National Chairman of Zenith Labour Party, Chief Dan Nwanyanwu has commended the National Assembly for passing the bill to repeal the current national anthem and revert to the original National Anthem which commenced with the Nigeria’s Independence on October 1st,1960. Chief Dan Nwanyanwu stated this today Monday 27th 2024, during a Press conference at the party National Secretariat in Abuja . Nwanyanwu who also congratulated the lawmakers, said he felt vindicated by the noble act of 10th National Assembly which he said was in complete consonance with his Presidential Manifesto for the 2023 Presidential Election where he vigorously canvassed for the return to Nigeria’s old national anthem. According to him, “What the National Assembly has done, has not only proved that it is sensitive to the yearning’s of the people but it’s also abundantly clear that there was no justifiable reason to have tampered with the 1960 National Anthem of Nigeria to the extent of replacing it with a meaningless anthem that makes mockery of Nigeria’s diversity and yearning for unity. “The National Anthem of a country is so symbolic that it becomes strange that when Military adventurists without any form of consultation or logic, repealed Nigeria’s charished National Anthem by military fiat. Many countries of the world have retained their National Anthem for several centuries as long as they existed as a Nation. Nigeria unfortunately has become a guinea pig that everything is experimented on without a convincing reason. “The 1960 National Anthem of Nigeria touches the very core of our diversity, and religious complexities. Nwanyanwu further stated that the National Anthem evoked emotions and the call for a united Nigeria where equity justice will reign supreme with no citizen oppressed and a section being preponderant over others with clear equity of citizens. “These are the reasons I gave when I canvassed for the reverting to the original National Anthem. I joined all well meaning Nigerians in commending the National Assembly and its leadership for their courage and patriotism in this regard. “I urged Mr President to waste no time assenting to this bill without delay and history will record the enactment of this landmark Act to his credit,” Chief Dan Nwanyanwu added. The Zenith Labour Party also seized the opportunity to commend President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for the achievements recorded since he became Nigeria’s democratically elected President.",

        "content": "PUNTERS have mourned the loss of a \"brilliant venue\" as a bingo hall closes its doors for good today. Buzz Bingo 's traditional bingo hall in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire , will pull down the shutters for the final time. The 26,000sq ft establishment on Shenley Road was popular with players in the area. The move comes as Buzz Bingo is set to test much smaller boutique bingo premises for use on high streets, reports the Times. And it's not all bad news for bingo lovers in Borehamwood with a new bingo hall is opening in the same area on May 28 to replace the old establishment. But the \"new and improved\" 3,000sq ft site has a capacity of only 150 players. However, the new hall is described as a \"major glow up \" with plenty in store for players to enjoy and see for themselves at the re-opening. Members can expect a fresh modern atmosphere with stylish decor and comfy new seating in a more contemporary, state-of-the-art \"bingo lounge\" layout. The Slots Room will feature the latest fun games and slot machines. Punters can also enjoy a new menu including a delicious range of paninis and halloumi fries. Dinesh Pandithurai, General Manager at Buzz Bingo Borehamwood, said: “We’re so excited to bring our amazing community the bingo they know and love with added sparkle.\" One Facebook user praised the new development, saying: \"Looks brilliant. Well done all. Look forward to seeing it soon.\" Another added: \"Good luck to all staff and management I'm sure you will smash it.\" Although many were excited at the potential \"glow-up\", others were apprehensive about the change. Social media was abuzz with people weighing in with their opinions on the new site. One wrote: \"Doesn’t look like many places to sit and play.\" Another said: \"I feel sorry for anyone that turns up on a busy night and gets turned away.\" While a third said that the original \"brilliant venue\" would be missed by many. Buzz Bingo — then Gala Bingo — was acquired by Caledonia Innvestments in 2015 for £241 million. It is now owned by ICG, which bought a majority stake in the business from Caledonia in 2021. In 2015 it had 130 clubs, but it has been whittled down to 83 as leases have expired, sites have been redeveloped and poorly performing venues have been closed. Dominic Mansour, 47, chief executive at Buzz Bingo, said new smaller bingo premises had been “at the core of their communities for more than 25 years [with] a focus on a low-stake bingo offer with frequent winners”. Mansour told The Times: “There was a renaissance last year where we saw an interesting adoption of bingo among a younger demographic. \"Historically this business has always been known for a middle-aged female demographic. Then last year we saw increases in younger customers looking for a different night out. \"It’s low risk. It’s a very good experience. It’s the softest form of gambling and is very good value.” He said that bingo still represented “a very, very safe place for women of a certain demographic to go out and have some fun\". Buzz is buying a business that welcomed 410,000 visitors last year and has recorded a 5 per cent increase in admissions in the year to date. On average they pay out winnings of more than £1 million a month. The pandemic was a tough blow as many stores had to close during lockdown . Since then energy costs have risen and more shoppers than ever are choosing to order online rather than head into stores. This has left some remaining retailers grappling with budgets and having no choice but to close stores to cut costs. The Body Shop is currently going through administration and announced plans to close half of its 198 stores with seven already closed. Boots revealed it would be closing 300 stores over the next year as part of plans to evolve its brand . WHSmith told The Sun it has no plans to open anymore more high street stores as it wants to focus on the travel side of its business. Major banks have also announced multiple branch closures. Halifax is closing several branches this month and more are due to close later on in the year. Even charity shops are struggling Oxfam confirmed it would close eight of its UK stores last year.",

        "content": "BRAINTREE, Mass. (AP) — A Massachusetts man will be arraigned Tuesday on multiple charges including assault with the intent to murder after six people, including four girls at a movie theater, were stabbed in separate attacks , officials said. Jared Ravizza, 26, of Chilmark, a town on Martha's Vineyard, was arrested Saturday night after a police pursuit. Police said a man entered AMC Braintree 10 south of Boston at about 6 p.m. Saturday and went into one of the theaters without paying. The girls, ages 9 to 17, were inside the theater when the man suddenly attacked them “without saying anything and without any warning” before running out, the Braintree Police Department said in a news release. The four suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were taken to hospitals. Video footage showed the man's vehicle and a license plate, and that information was broadcast to law enforcement, police said. A vehicle matching that description was later seen in Plymouth, about 27 miles (43 kilometers) south of Braintree. Police said it had left a McDonald's restaurant, where a 21-year-old woman and a 29-year-old man were found stabbed. Both were taken to hospitals with injuries. State police found the vehicle another 20 miles (32.19 kilometers) south, in Sandwich, and unsuccessfully attempted to pull it over. The vehicle later crashed. Ravizza, the driver, was taken into custody shortly afterward and was being treated at a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries, police said. It was not immediately known if he is being represented by an attorney. No phone listing could be found in his name.",

        "content": "SAN JOSE — San Jose police are investigating the city’s 15th homicide of this year, a man who was found dead from a gunshot wound in an apartment complex near a busy shopping mall. The killing occurred at about 2:45 p.m. on Sunday at an apartment in the 1000 block of Blossom River Way, a street that’s adjacent to the bustling Westfield Oakridge shopping center in South San Jose. “When officers arrived, they located an adult male victim who was neither conscious nor breathing and was suffering from at least one gunshot wound,” the San Jose Police Department stated in a prepared release. Police officers immediately began to administer life-saving measures to the victim and at the same time called emergency medical responders to the apartment. But the man died in the apartment, police said. The victim, described as an adult male, wasn’t immediately identified. “The suspect is unknown and fled the scene prior to police arrival,” the police department said. “The motive and circumstances surrounding the event are under investigation.” The Santa Clara County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s Office will release the man’s name once he is identified and his next of kin are notified. Anyone with information is asked to email Detective Sgt. Julien Taylor at 4257@sanjoseca.gov or Detective Mike Harrington 4365@sanjoseca.gov, or call 408-277-5283.",

        "content": "INQUIRER PHOTO / GRIG C. MONTEGRANDE MANILA, Philippines — Analysts expect inflation in the Philippines to settle at an average of 3.7 percent this year, a slight improvement from the 3.8 percent consensus back in April. According to the Monetary Policy Report of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) released on Monday, forecasters surveyed said they expect “within-target inflation over the policy horizon, although settling at the upper end of the target range as uncertainty lingers.” “Upside risks continue to dominate due mainly to supply disruptions,” the BSP said. This is why the BSP is being “very careful” not to cut rates too early to avoid stoking inflation. READ: BSP unlikely to cut interest rates too soon this year, says think tank While average price growth is expected to return to the target band in 2024 after settling above that range in the last two years, BSP Senior Assistant Governor Iluminada Sicat said the central bank was treading lightly when it comes to the timing of easing. “Indeed, we are anticipating that higher inflation rate will be observed from May to July but thereafter, we are projecting that inflation will revert to the target range,” Sicat said at an economic forum on Monday. “We foresee inflation to be within the target, but on the upper end of the target range. That is precisely the reason why the BSP has been very careful not to bring down interest rates too early, or else we may not be able to address some of the upside risks that we are seeing in the future,” she added. The peso became more volatile last week after Governor Eli Remolona Jr. struck a less hawkish tone and floated the possibility of two 25-basis point rate cuts this year, with the first one possibly in August and ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s own easing. READ: BSP chief unfazed by U.S. Fed’s hawkish signals The central bank chief said he was not worried about such a move’s impact on the peso, which may come under pressure if local yields become less attractive to capital inflows while interest rates are still high elsewhere. This month, the BSP’s policy rate was kept at a 17-year high of 6.5 percent for the fifth straight meeting. READ: BSP keeps key rate at 17-year high as inflation risk remains Remolona assured the market that the BSP has “ample reserves” to defend the peso against speculative attacks. A weak currency—which breached the 58-per-dollar level last week—can fan inflation by making imports more expensive. For his part, Finance Secretary Ralph Recto, who also joined the same economic briefing, said a rate cut in the third quarter was “very much possible.” “It all depends on the inflation outlook and I suppose what the Fed does. Those spreads should not be too different between the US and the Philippines or else you might have a flight to safety,” said Recto, who represents President Marcos’ Cabinet in the Monetary Board.

Surely, I don’t expect interest rates to go any higher. If not, there’s time they’ll start going down. Maybe 150 basis points in the next two years,” he added. INQ",

        "content": "By Sarah NEGEDU Officials of the Federal Capital Territory Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board, have cautioned FCT contingents against extravagance and other reckless lifestyle that can make them vulnerable during the Hajj exercise. The admonition is coming following the increasing reports of loss of properties by some pilgrims, especially the first timer. The officials who embarked on special enlightenment sessions aimed at exposing first timers to the best way to live in both Mecca and Medina, warned against activities capable of attracting severe penalty from the authorities of kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They regretted that despite repeated warning on the implications of extravagance, some of the pilgrims have recklessly spent their Basic Traveling Allowance, BTA. According to them, the pilgrims should exercise caution in all their financial transactions in view of the remaining days ahead. They also emphasized the importance of cleanliness and proper utilization of facilities provided at their various accommodations. Some of the pilgrims expressed appreciation for the guidance and pledged to use the knowledge acquired to better their living conditions in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. While pledging to be law abiding citizens in their host country, the pilgrims also promised to be good ambassador of their Nigeria throughout the period of their stay in the Holy land.",

        "content": "TL;DR: For people who don't like the look of a clunky desk with a PC and peripherals piled on top, this video is a must-watch. In fact, it's a must watch for anyone interested in clever craftsmanship and technology. The 27-minute video documents the process of building an invisible PC, along with the custom-made parts needed for the project. Picture a Venn diagram showing the relationship between people who care about home decor and people who own a gaming PC. The people in the middle circle, however large or small it may be, would be the group delighted with the latest video from YouTube channel DIY Perks . It shows how to build the Endgame Invisible PC – a desk with a hidden hatch that opens to reveal a widescreen OLED monitor with all the peripherals underneath and a PC cooled by a custom liquid cooling radiator. In short, it houses a high-performance PC that doesn't disrupt the room's design and aesthetic. It doesn't hurt that Matthew Perks, who runs the YouTube channel, is a skilled craftsman with IT credentials. He has made videos of other DIY projects, such as building a \"stealthy\" PlayStation 5 . The 27-minute video documents how to build the invisible PC and the materials necessary for the project, ranging from stripped-down components to custom-made parts that work together seamlessly. For instance, the monitor mounting process, which is very complex, involves several custom components to integrate the 45-inch OLED display within the desk. The desktop is made from aluminum sheets that are 3mm thick and are supported by an extruded aluminum frame. The 3mm sheets are flexible and only become rigid after the panels are attached. Custom hinges, pneumatic struts and tension springs combine to create a hinge mechanism for the monitor hatch. Throughout the video, Perks relies on a mix of special hinges, custom L-brackets, pneumatic struts, tension springs, and sliding rails to integrate the various joints and panels. Perks used a 45-inch Corsair Xeneon Flex ultrawide bendable OLED monitor, which he stripped down to its PCB and panel to minimize its size. The peripherals include a full-size keyboard, a mouse, a headset, and an external audio interface with the OLED monitor. The PC components include an Intel Core i9-13900K processor, Asrock Z790 PG-ITX/TB4 motherboard, and Zotac GeForce RTX 4090, all cooled with water blocks. Because ATX and SFX power supplies were too large to conceal, Perks used two HDPlex 500W GaN power supplies, dedicating one to the GPU. For storage, he installed twelve 4TB Crucial P3 M.2 drives in a Flashtor 12 Pro NAS, connected to the motherboard via an M.2 port and a 10Gbit M.2 network card.",

Kotov raced into a 4-0 lead and Norrie was unable to peg him back as he bowed out at the first-round stage for the first time since 2020. Norrie was joined on the British scrapheap by Harriet Dart, who lost 7-6 (3) 6-4 to Czech 27th seed Linda Noskova.

        "content": "As Nigerians celebrate the Children’s Day across the country, Nollywood actress, Toyin Abraham has opened up about her feelings as she revealed why the celebration brings her unhappiness. Taking to her Instagram page, Toyin Abraham wrote a lengthy note wishing all parents, who were once children, a Happy Children’s Day. She emphasized the need for better parenting in society, stating that recent observations and encounters compelled her to share this heartfelt message, as the quality of upbringing for today’s children requires serious attention. Toyin Abraham wrote, “I am not happy on this children’s day. “Happy Children’s Day to all children and to parents who were once children. As we celebrate this day, it is essential to acknowledge the need for better parenting. “Recent online encounters and observations compel me to share this heartfelt message with every parent and guardian. “The quality of children we are raising today needs serious attention. We now have kids who see respect and courtesy as burdens. “How do we feel reading some of the things the youth say to adults online under the guise of being “woke” or adopting a “no tolerance” attitude? “Many of us were not raised the way we are raising our kids today. We are raising them with kid gloves because we believe times have changed. However, different times are not an excuse to raise disrespectful children. “Despite our age and blessings, there are still things we would not tell our parents, not out of fear, but out of respect. This Children’s Day should remind us to do better as parents and raise children who are respectful and kind. “The recent tragic event at Ajayi Crowther University, where students killed a fellow student in the name of jungle justice, highlights the severe consequences of a lack of home training and moral values. Even if theft occurred, it does not justify taking another person’s life. “Respect, courtesy, responsibility, kindness, and hard work are values we were raised with. Although we may not have liked the discipline at the time, we are grateful to our parents today for instilling these values in us. We have a nation-building responsibility to raise the next generation of quality individuals. “Happy Children’s Day once again. May God keep our children for us, protect us from all forms of evil, and grant us a great celebration filled with wonderful experiences for the kids. “My name is Toyin Abraham Ajeyemi. I was once a little child, and I am now entrusted with the responsibility of raising quality children for a better society and nation.”",

        "content": "Anthony Martial has confirmed that he will leave Manchester United for nothing this summer. The Frenchman's contract expires at the end of 2023/24 campaign and having not agreed an extension, he has announced that he will be departing. An open letter to supporters on social media on Monday evening read: \"Dear Manchester United fans, It’s with great emotion that I write to you today to say goodbye. After nine incredible years at the club, the time has come for me to turn a new page in my career. \"Since I arrived in 2015, I have had the immense honour of wearing this shirt and playing in front of you, the best supporters in the world !

With all my affection, Anthony Martial.\" Anthony Martial scored a memorable goal vs Liverpool on his Man United debut ( Image: Getty Images) Who do you think Man United should sign this summer? Share your suggestions below Martial, a 30-time French international, joined the Red Devils in 2015 as a teenager from Monaco. The deal was worth an initial £36m, potentially rising as high as £57.6m. The forward enjoyed a bright start to life at Old Trafford. He scored on his debut with a brilliant solo goal against Liverpool - one of 17 in all competitions that season. He remained a key player for the next few campaigns with his 23 goals in the 2019/20 campaign a career-best. However, inconsistency and injuries blighted his final few years with the club. He joined Spanish side Sevilla on-loan for the second-half of the 2021/22 campaign. Martial made just 19 appearances this season under Erik ten Hag , scoring twice. He has been linked with a move to Inter Milan . Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

        "description": "EastEnders aired the biggest 'doof doof' tonight as Nish Panesar revealed he was dying - but is he telling the truth, or does he have a master plan for his ex Suki Panesar",
        "content": "EastEnders aired a huge return for Nish Panesar tonight - as he dropped the bombshell he is dying. On tonight's episode of the BBC soap, Nish made an unwelcome return to Albert Square, a few weeks after he had been kicked out of the family home for what he had done to Suki over the weeks and years. As he made his return to Walford, he let himself into the house with his spare key and when Ravi threatened to throw him out, he announced to his shocked family that he was dying and it was only a matter of time before he was out of their lives for good. However, fans are convinced they've rumbled that Nish is actually keeping something from the family. Some are rightly suspicious on whether he is telling the truth about his illness and took to social media to share their thoughts. Ravi was unimpressed with Nish coming back to Walford ( Image: BBC) \"Let me guess, Nish is dying in the same way that Angie only had six months to live and Suki had cancer,\" one wrote, whilst another replied: \"I'm leaning towards him actually telling the truth, but with a revenge plan in mind and not the redemption he's claiming. It would be colossally stupid for Vinny and Suki herself not to demand solid proof... The only real option I see for him faking it with \"proof\" is if Nina or some random dodgy doctor (friend of Roger Peele's, maybe?) is helping him. Or I guess they can simply have the entire family be stupid and take his word for it.\" A third added: \"Does Nish genuinely expect his family to what? Forgive & forget, welcoming him back with open arms? Definitely up to something. Had months to plot his revenge #Eastenders ,\" whilst a fourth wrote: \"I have a feeling he’s lying to get back in his family’s good books. #EastEnders .\" A fifth added: \"Nish is 100% lying!! #EastEnders .\" Back in February, Nish actor Navin Chowdry teased more to come in his character's huge storyline. He told us: \"I am alive, I believe so. I had text messages on my phone [during the Christmas episode] going, 'oh no' and then two minutes later 'oh...'. I think despite the whole nation being gutted that I'm still alive, I feel okay about it for now.\" On whether we could see Nish taking revenge or opt for a redemption arc, he went on: \"There’s either redemption or revenge so let's see what happens, there can only be one,\" before warning there was \"unfinished business\" with the Panesars. * Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .",

        "content": "FANDUEL TV has altered its schedule once again with Kay Adams nowhere to be seen. The much-loved sports talk show host , 38, was absent from her usual slot at 11am ET on Monday. Adams was also missing from the midday slot on the previous Friday. This coincides with Memorial Day weekend, for which Adams previously revealed she had traveled back home. \"Alright, it is Thursday, which means it's Friday in my world,\" she joked to kick off her show on May 23rd. Thankfully fans need not fear as Up And Adams is scheduled to return on Tuesday, May 28 at 11am ET. As for Adams, whether she will be broadcasting remotely from her stunning home once again or back at their usual studio is unclear. Fans quizzed the host on exactly where her incredible-looking home was during Thursday's show, but she remained coy on the details. Although Adams did admit she was on the West Coast, she added that her hilltop home was \"absolutely not\" in the Hollywood Hills. One fan jokingly suggested that her home looked eerily similar to a penthouse from Grand Theft Auto. This side-by-side was reshared by the show's X, formerly known as Twitter , account. \"@heykayadams just living her best life,\" they captioned the post. \"It's hard to be Queen Kay!!\" one fan responded. \"Your house looks balling!\" said a second. While another added, \"That view though.\" As for what fans can expect from Tuesday's show, Adams revealed that NFL veterans Emmanuel Sanders and Jared Allen are both expected to make an appearance. Two-time Pro Bowler Sanders spent 12 seasons in the league but is most well known for his Super Bowl -winning tenure with the Denver Broncos . Here he formed an integral part of Gary Kubiak's offense alongside Peyton Manning and Demaryius Thomas. Sanders retired having racked up 9,245 receiving yards and 52 total touchdowns. Kay Adams is a fantasy football expert who shot to fame as the host of Good Morning Football in New York City for six years. Having previously hosted fantasy-based shows, Adams took on the role of GMFB presenter when it launched in 2016. And, along with Nate Burleson, Kyle Brandt, and Peter Schrager, she helped make that show one of the best in sports. Adams left GMFB to pursue new ventures in 2022. She relocated to Los Angeles and linked up with FanDuel to start a self-titled show - Up and Adams. Her latest program airs on weekdays at 11 am ET, sometimes from special locations such as the Super Bowl or Kentucky Derby. Allen too spent 12 years in the NFL, finishing with 136 sacks - good for 16th most in league history. During his time with the Kansas City Chiefs and the Minnesota Vikings, Allen was named a First-Team All-Pro four times and reached five Pro Bowls.",

        "content": "Over the bank holiday weekend, pictures were shared on social media highlighting people using barbecues on the beach and surrounding green space. Council banned all barbecues, both disposable and in pits on East Beach, in July last year following years of mounting pressure from residents. Residents began campaigning for the ban following a series of injuries, fires and damage to public benches, leading to a public space protection order being put in place. Anyone found having a barbecue could be issued a fine by Southend Council. Martin Terry, Independent Southend councillor responsible for public safety, is set to press for action with the council’s community safety team as the weather warms up. He said: “This is problem with some of the day-trippers we get to town. They flaunt our facilities. “I will be making sure the community safety officers are dealing with this and picking up on it. “It is early doors, and it doesn’t surprise me. It is disrespectful behaviour that needs to be stopped. We will be focusing on this. “We have had cases of children being burnt by hot coals being left. One was even buried in the sand and a child stood on it. “It is outrageous behaviour. I will make sure our community safety team are focused on this now the hot weather is coming.” The ban was introduced in 2022, includes potentially dangerous disposable barbecues which have led to children being injured on the seafront. Back in summer of 2021, a child was left screaming in agony after stepping where a disposable barbecue with searing hot coals had been on the beach. The two-year-old suffered singed feet that were covered in blisters after walking where a “boiling hot” tin barbecue had been, unbeknown to her. “NO BBQ” signs have been point at key entrance points to East Beach, including the walkthrough from the train station and on the sides of public toilets when the ban was put in place.",

        "content": "Pakistan paceman Haris Rauf believes that the three months he spent on the sidelines injured with a dislocated shoulder could yet prove a \"blessing in disguise\", as he gears up for the Twenty20 World Cup. The 30-year-old fast bowler made an encouraging return to competitive cricket, taking 2-34, in the second match of Pakistan's warm-up series against T20 world champions England in Birmingham on Saturday. \"I was injured [for] the last few months but if you believe in yourself, then the layoff can be a blessing in disguise,\" he told a pre-match press conference in Cardiff on Monday ahead of the third T20. \"Because you have time to recover and reassess your game-plans. I felt good coming back to cricket. When you play for your country, it makes you very proud.\" As for the mental and physical strain of returning from injury for a fast bowler, Rauf said: \"It's hard. It's a struggle during your rehab, and it's difficult when you come back to maintain that pace and accuracy. But if you believe in yourself, it makes things easier. When I wasn't in the team and rehabbing, I had a lot of time to think about my game and work on myself. \"Thankfully I'm back now, and the World Cup is coming up.\" Rauf's return at Edgbaston could not prevent Pakistan suffering a 23-run defeat by England as they fell 1-0 behind in the four-match series with two to play following a washed-out opener. But Rauf insisted Pakistan, the 2009 T20 world champions, remained in optimistic mood ahead of their opening match at this year's global showpiece against co-hosts the United States in Dallas on June 6. \"When you lose a game it hurts, but as a team, we are confident,\" he said. \"We feel we can beat any opposition on any day. We've done it in the past, too. When you make mistakes you learn and try not to repeat those mistakes. We're looking to play better in the next few games and make a comeback. \"The camp is relaxed. We're enjoying ourselves. We're trying to follow our game-plans and execute them well. The results haven't often been in our favour recently but if you stick to your plans they can sometimes follow.\" England will lock horns against Pakistan in the T20I at the Sophia Gardens in Cardiff on Tuesday, May 28. The hosts are 1-0 up in the four-match series after defeating Babar Azam and his men in the second T20Is courtesy of standout performances from captain Jos Buttler, Will Jacks, Moeen Ali, and Jofra Archer.

        "content": "MOHENJO DARO: Sindh on Monday recorded over 52°C (125.6 degrees Fahrenheit) temperature, making it the highest reading of the sizzling summer and close to the country’s record high amid the ongoing heatwave, said the Met Office. Extreme temperatures throughout Asia over the past month were made worse most likely as a result of human-driven climate change, a team of international scientists have said. In Mohenjo Daro, temperatures rose as high as 52.2°C (126 °F) over the last 24 hours, a senior official of the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), Shahid Abbas told Reuters . The reading is the highest of the summer so far, and approached the town's and country's record highs of 53.5 °C (128.3 °F) and 54 °C (129.2 °F) respectively. Mohenjo Daro is a small town that experiences extremely hot summers and mild winters, and low rainfall, but its limited markets, including bakeries, tea shops, mechanics, electronic repair shops, and fruit and vegetable sellers, are usually bustling with customers. But with the current heatwave, shops are seeing almost no footfall. \"The customers are not coming to the restaurant because of extreme heat. I sit idle at the restaurant with these tables and chairs and without any customers,\" Wajid Ali, 32, who owns a tea stall in the town. \"I take baths several times a day which gives me a little relief. Also there is no power. The heat has made us very uneasy.\" Close to Ali's shop is an electronic repairs shop run by Abdul Khaliq, 30, who was sat working with the shop's shutter half down to shield him from the sun. Khaliq also complained about the heat affecting business. Local doctor Mushtaq Ahmed added that the locals have adjusted to living in the extreme weather conditions and prefer staying indoors or near water. The highest temperature recorded in the country was in 2017 when temperatures rose to 54°C (129.2 °F) in the city of Turbat, located in the Southwestern province of Balochistan. This was the second hottest in Asia and fourth highest in the world, said PMD Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz. The heatwave will subside in Mohenjo Daro and surrounding areas, but another spell is expected to hit other areas in the province, including Karachi.",

        "content": "By Sarah NEGEDU As Nigeria joins the rest of the world to mark this year’s International Children’s Day, the Federal Government has re-affirmed its commitment to all matters relating to the total well-being and development of the Nigerian child. According to President Bola Tinubu, his administration is currently embarking on key transformative policies to create a conducive learning environment across the country. President Tinubu who was speaking at an event to mark the 2024 National Children’s Day in Abuja on Monday, said the federal government had established the National Education Data System, approved skill development for all levels of education and teachers ‘training in digital skills. Tinubu, who was represented by the FCT Minister of State, Dr Mariya Mahmoud, said government has also committed to establishing 24 skills and innovation hubs and Entrepreneurship Centres across the country. “Also, the FG is set to inaugurate private sector Innovation Enterprise Centres across the country to deliver on the skills acquisition programme of the government. “The government is also building 91 Vocational Centres in secondary schools across the country to ensure that all levels of education enjoy the impact of our policy. “We are also working with the State Commissioners of Women Affairs and the State Ministries of Education, State Universal Basic Education Board and Civil Society Organisations to ensure quality education and skills development for Nigerian children,” Tinubu said. Earlier, the Children Parliament, FCT, stressed the need to receive the education and skills necessary to thrive. The Speaker of the parliament, Rahama Waziri, said, empowering children with education and skills was pivotal to the sustainable growth and development of the country. “It is through their eyes that we envision a brighter tomorrow, and it is through their development that we can achieve it. “Education is the bedrock of any progressive society. It is the tool that empowers individuals to transcend the limitations of their circumstances and achieve their full potential. “For the Nigerian child, quality education is not just a right but a necessity. It is the gateway to opportunities, the key to breaking the cycle of poverty, and the foundation for a prosperous and equitable society.” She also stressed the need for skills development, describing it as crucial in preparing children for the challenges and opportunities of the future. She noted that the world was rapidly evolving, and the jobs of tomorrow would demand a diverse set of skills. “It is imperative that we children are equipped with both technical and soft skills that will enable us to adapt and thrive. “We need to ensure that schools are well-equipped with modern facilities, including libraries, laboratories, digital resources, with curriculum updated to reflect current realities and future projections. “In this digital age, technology plays a crucial role in education. Integrating ICT in classrooms can enhance learning experiences and provide students with the skills needed in a tech-driven world,” she said. On her part, the Minister of Women Affairs, Uju Kennedy-Ohanenye, assured the children that their rights would be protected. Kennedy-Ohanenye said: “When it comes to fighting for your rights, I shall always be there for you because Mr. President said the poor shall breathe and the children are one of the vulnerable.",

Tyler Boyd Career Stats In The Slot Receptions 390 1st Receiving Yards 4,813 1st First Downs 233 1st Titans' starting QB Will Levis struggled mightily throughout his rookie season, primarily due to the lack of receiving talent around him.

        "description": "The programme has unlocked Sh11.4 billion in education aid since 2004.",
        "content": "The Kenya Scholar Access Programme (KenSAP) has ridden on an average annual budget of $300,000 (Sh39.3 million) to unlock more than $87 million (Sh11.4 billion) in financial aid to close to 300 bright students in Kenya. Last week, 22 students were offered American university scholarships worth $7.5 Million (Sh980 million) for 2024 entrance to top Ivy League universities and colleges. They have been admitted to Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Amherst, Brown, Claremont McKenna, Colgate, Dartmouth, Davidson, Hamilton, Middlebury, Northwestern, Smith, Tufts, University of Pennsylvania, University of Toronto, Wellesley, and Williams. The scholars comprise the top performers from the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education(KCSE) Class of 2023, selected from all 47 counties in Kenya, and come from underprivileged backgrounds. KenSAP pays for students to participate in its free residential university access programme for nearly six months, guiding them through the American university application process and teaching them the skills they will need to excel in American universities. The universities provide scholarship packages that cover a comprehensive range of expenses, including tuition fees, accommodations, meals, travel costs, and other costs of attendance. The programme continues to provide students with guidance, mentorship, and support while they are studying at university. This financial assistance ensures that the scholars can focus on their academic pursuits without the burden of financial constraints, allowing them to fully immerse themselves in their new educational environments. Speaking during the dinner gala to celebrate the scholars, the principal benefactor and chairman of KenSAP’s Board of Directors, Charles Field-Marsham said it is their commitment to nurture the brightest minds in Kenya from disadvantaged backgrounds. \"By providing these exceptional students with the resources they need, we are not only investing in their futures but also the future of the country and bringing bright Kenyan minds to places all across the world,'' Field-Marsham said. “This achievement shows the potential of a true global citizen within you but there is still much hard work ahead of you to achieve your potential.\" Each year, KenSAP selects 20 students from more than 1,000 highly qualified applicants. Just to apply, candidates must rank among the top 1⁄10 of one per cent of all test takers on the KCSE. KenSAP’s selection process, like that of the universities to which its students apply, is holistic, taking into consideration a range of criteria beyond the purely academic, such as family background, extracurricular accomplishments, commitment to community development, and leadership potential. The selected students spend 20 weeks in residential training free of charge, with KenSAP covering all of their costs of attendance. In this training programme, they prepare for university entrance Since 2006, every student taken into the programme has earned admission, with full financial aid, to a distinguished American college or university. Since its inception in 2004, more than 80 KenSAP beneficiary students have returned to Kenya to work at leading companies and institutions. The programme was launched when Kenyatta University Professor Mike Boit and American journalist friend John Manners initiated a successful pilot scheme with a group of five students which was a year later scaled to 12-15 students. The founding sponsor Charles Field-Marsham stepped in to ensure management stability and financial sustainability for the programme, providing 95 per cent of its funding until 2017, when he and Alan Davidson, KenSAP’s current executive director, led the programme to a more sustainable fundraising approach. Nowadays, the programe relies on alumni to fundraise almost 20 per cent of the annual budget, and in the past few years, they have given more than $350,000 of their own money back to KenSAP. The team has also been finding other sources of sustainable financial support through Kenyan corporates such as those in attendance at the Annual Charity Dinner Gala. The organisation's vision aligns with a time when private and public stakeholders are being called up to embrace sustainable practices by adopting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a guide to assist in the attainment of inclusive and equitable quality education.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The testimony in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It's impossible to say how long all of that will take, but in a landmark trial that's already featured its fair share of memorable moments , this week could easily be the most important. Here's what to expect in the days ahead: Starting Tuesday morning, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments expected to last for much of the day, if not all of it. The arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election to a porn star who alleged she had a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations. Look for prosecutors to remind jurors that they can trust the financial paperwork they've seen and the witnesses they've heard from. That includes porn actor Stormy Daniels , whose account of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump is at the heart of the case, and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme and authorized payments. It's worth remembering that the defense, which called only two witnesses but not Trump, doesn't have to prove anything or convince jurors of Trump's innocence. To prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases. Expect the defense to try to poke holes in the government's case by disputing Daniels' testimony about her hotel suite encounter with Trump and by distancing Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements to Cohen, who was responsible for the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels. The defense may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid. And it'll certainly attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand . How much of his testimony the jury believes will go a long way in determining the outcome of the case. Since the prosecution has the burden of proof, it will deliver its summation last — the reverse order from opening statements, in which the prosecution went first. A critical moment will take place, perhaps Wednesday morning, before the jury begins its deliberations. Judge Juan M. Merchan is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence. In an indication of just how important those instructions are, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a spirited debate last week outside the jury's presence as they sought to persuade Merchan about the instructions he should give. The Trump team, for instance, sought an instruction informing jurors that the types of hush money payments at issue in Trump’s case are not inherently illegal, a request a prosecutor called “totally inappropriate.” Merchan said such an instruction would go too far and is unnecessary. Trump's team also asked Merchan to consider the “extraordinarily important” nature of the case when issuing his instructions and to urge jurors to reach “very specific findings.” Prosecutors objected to that as well, and Merchan agreed that it would be wrong to deviate from the standard instructions. “When you say it’s a very important case, you’re asking me to change the law, and I’m not going to do that,” Merchan said. Prosecutors, meanwhile, requested an instruction that someone’s status as a candidate doesn’t need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign. Defense lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn’t running, it shouldn’t be treated as a campaign contribution. The deliberations will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that's intentionally opaque. Jurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it's hard to read too much into the meaning of any note. It's anyone's guess how long the jury will deliberate for and there's no time limit either. The jury must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that could take some time, and a verdict might not come by the end of the week. To reach a verdict, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it. Things will get trickier if the jury can't reach a consensus after several days of deliberations. Though defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial, Merchan is likely to call the jurors in and instruct them to keep trying for a verdict and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others. If, after that instruction, the jury still can't reach a verdict, the judge would have the option to deem the panel hopelessly deadlocked and declare a mistrial.

        "content": "Indigo Books & Music Inc. shareholders have voted to approve a deal that will see the retailer become a private company. Shareholders voted Monday in favour of a $2.50 per share offer from Trilogy Retail Holdings Inc. and Trilogy Investments L.P., which already held a 56 per cent stake in Indigo. The Trilogy companies are owned by Gerald Schwartz, the spouse of Indigo chief executive Heather Reisman, and had originally offered $2.25 per share but raised their bid in April. \"We are pleased with the result of today's vote and look forward to continuing our work on Indigo's transformation strategy,\" Reisman said in a statement shared with CBC News. \"We remain deeply committed to our customers and to all our stakeholders as we work together to inspire reading and enrich the lives of booklovers across the country.\" Indigo agrees to go private after sale to holding company owned by chief executive's spouse Meet Gerald Schwartz, the billionaire behind the Onex and WestJet deal For Trilogy's offer to be accepted, it required approval by a two-thirds majority vote of Indigo shareholders and a simple majority vote by shareholders not linked to Trilogy and its affiliates. Slightly more than 95 per cent of votes from shareholders represented at Monday's meeting were in favour of accepting the deal. Out of the shareholders that were independent of Trilogy or its affiliates, just shy of 83 per cent of the votes supported the offer. A package from Indigo's e-commerce unit is shown in a shipping processing facility in December 2022. Some 95.09 per cent of votes from shareholders represented at the meeting Monday were in favour of accepting the deal between Indigo and Trilogy. (Evan Mitsui/CBC) 'Bleeding cash' The privatization allows Indigo to avoid some scrutiny as it works to bring profitability and growth back to Canada's biggest bookstore. \"The rationale is not to be saddled with public reporting responsibilities because Indigo has been through a lot,\" said Richard Leblanc, a professor of governance, law and ethics at York University in Toronto, in February, when the Trilogy firms made their offer. Trilogy now faces a hefty amount of work. Indigo is still recovering from a cyber attack that downed its website for a lengthy period last year, a series of quarterly losses leading up to a January layoff, and a succession of changes that saw four of 10 board members depart last year with one claiming mistreatment and \"a loss of confidence in board leadership.\" Philanthropists Gerald Schwartz and Heather Reisman clap and blow kisses to the crowd during an announcement of their donation to the University of Toronto on Monday, March 25, 2019. The companies buying Indigo are owned by Schwartz. (Cole Burston/The Canadian Press) Reisman, who retired amid the turmoil, returned within months to helm Indigo. The issues have played out as inflation and high interest rates make many Canadians think twice about opening their wallets, especially for the discretionary items Indigo is known for. The trend cropped up particularly in the holiday season, when Indigo executives admitted they had overbought merchandise and stocked an assortment of merchandise they found customers weren't looking for in the final weeks before Christmas. \"Despite all their best efforts, they are not doing well,\" Kai Li, the Canada Research Chair in corporate governance who teaches at the University of British Columbia, said of Indigo in February. \"They are bleeding cash.\" Sale expected to close in June To turn things around, Indigo has been carrying out a transformation plan since at least November. It's offered few specifics, but Reisman, who founded the chain in 1996, has said it is meant to \"return Indigo to both growth and profitability.\" An Indigo bookstore is seen Wednesday, Nov. 4, 2020 in Laval, QC. Trilogy hasn't said much about its plans for Indigo beyond it wanting to take the company private, but no public opposition to the deal has mounted. (Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press) In the months since she mentioned the plan, some stores have seen wellness products and the popular American Girl dolls culled from their shelves and Columbus Cafe & Co. has moved into some Indigo spaces previously held by Starbucks. Reisman has also pledged in newsletters to bring back its digital inventory search kiosks, program more events and add seating to more stores. Trilogy hasn't said much about its plans for Indigo beyond it wanting to take the company private, but no public opposition to the deal has mounted, likely because the money offered reflected a 69 per cent premium on the share price of $1.48 that Indigo had when Trilogy first made its bid. Indigo's share price sat at $2.48 ahead of the Monday vote. Last month, the offer garnered the support from a special committee of independent directors Indigo formed to assess the deal. Earlier this month, Indigo also said that leading independent proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis had recommended shareholders approve the deal. Indigo has said it expects the transaction to close in June and its shares to be delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange sometime after.",

        "content": "Business experts and real estate professionals have shared valuable insights on resilience, adaptability, and financial independence to drive the sales industry in Nigeria. Speaking at the Sales Pro- Conference in Lagos, the experts discussed strategies that would enable the sector to thrive in challenging economic times. The event, organized by Pertinence Group and themed ‘Selling in Tough Times,’ featured a lineup of distinguished speakers who shared valuable insights on resilience, adaptability, and financial independence in the sales industry. Co-founder of Pertinence Group, Sunday Olorunsheyi, set the tone for the conference with an inspiring keynote, emphasizing the importance of financial independence for sales professionals. In his words, “One of the major motivations for becoming a Sales pro is the desire for financial independence. Dig your well before you’re thirsty, know the tune before you start dancing, don’t dine with naysayers and doubters of your dreams, stay in control to unleash your potential, leverage information and detest poverty.” Top real estate saleswoman, Confidence Molade, delivered a compelling presentation on embracing change and seizing opportunities in tough markets. Molade highlighted the significance of staying positive and building trust and credibility, stating, “Sales is the lifeblood of every business. If you are not selling, you are not in business. “To make sales in a tough market, you must protect your mind from bad news, stay positive regardless of the conditions, and then learn to build trust and credibility.” Another Co-founder of Pertinence Group, Wisdom Ezekiel, addressed the critical topic of financial freedom for sales professionals in Nigeria, stressing the importance of financial literacy and planning for economic stability and growth. Serial entrepreneur Victor Gbenga Afolabi spoke on the psychology of selling during difficult times, emphasizing the fundamental role of selling in achieving success. “It is almost impossible to be successful without mastering the art of selling,” Afolabi stated, highlighting the significance of understanding that hard times are a natural part of life and not a barrier to closing deals. The conference also featured a panel session where veteran real estate consultants shared their personal experiences and opinions on the ever-evolving field of sales in real estate. Attendees had the opportunity to win special prizes through a raffle draw, with six winners receiving rewards ranging from a brand new mobile phone and high-tech drone gadget to exclusive mentorship slots with the Pertinence Group co-founders.",

        "content": "WARSAW, May 27: Defense officials in NATO member Poland on Monday presented a plan to strengthen anti-drone surveillance and on-ground military defense through a system of fortifications and barriers along about 700 kilometers (430 miles) of its eastern border with Russia and Russian ally Belarus. The government says Poland, which supports neighboring Ukraine in its defense against Russia’s aggression, is being targeted by hostile actions from Russia and Belarus. They include cyberattacks, attempted arson and migrants being pushed illegally across the border, which officials describe as intended to destabilize the European Union, of which Poland is a member. The government is also making preparations in the case of a military attack, while stressing the primary role of deterrence. The government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk has planned a range of security measures including in cyberspace, as well as a more than $2.5 billion investment in strengthening surveillance, deterrence and defense along the eastern border, a system known as Shield-East that is to be completed in 2028. Work on it has started, officials said. “The goal of the shield is to protect the territory of Poland, hamper the mobility of our adversary’s troops while making such mobility easier for our own troops and to protect civilians,” Defense Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz said at a news conference, adding that local communities understand the need for such steps. The shield will include “all kinds of fortifications, barriers, monitoring of the air space on every level and upgrading the existing systems,” and will be integrated with the defense system across the country, Kosiniak-Kamysz said. He stressed it was the biggest program to strengthen NATO’s eastern flank since 1945, when World War II ended. Chief of Staff Gen. Wiesław Kukuła said it will include a network of state-of-the-art anti-drone monitoring and defense towers, anti-tank barriers and ditches, bunkers and shelters, as well as space for potential mine fields. He stressed their primary role is to deter any potential aggressor. The officials said the system will be part of a regional defense infrastructure built jointly with the Baltic states — Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia — that are also on NATO’s eastern flank. The funding will come from the government, as Poland spends over 4% of its GDP on defense, but help will also be sought from the EU because the system will also strengthen the eastern border of the 27-member bloc, they said. Some observers noted that the much-publicized presentation came two weeks ahead of elections to the European Parliament, where Poland, a nation of some 38 million, holds 52 seats, and could be partly seen as a campaign element for the government that took office in December. The opposition also supports strengthening Poland’s defense. Poland’s previous right-wing government built a $400 million wall on the border with Belarus to halt a massive inflow of migrants that began to be pushed from that direction in 2021. The current pro-EU government says that needs to be strengthened, but will be a separate project from Shield-East. The three Baltic states were once part of the Soviet Union, while Poland was a satellite state before the 1990s. Moscow still regards the area as within its sphere of interest. To its east, Poland borders Russia’s exclave of Kaliningrad, as well as NATO ally Lithiania, Moscow’s ally Belarus, and Ukraine. (AP)",

        "content": "Photo: Ian Usher on Unsplash The Ministry of Innovation, Science and Industry has ordered the shuttering of two B.C. based technology companies, one of which makes drones with military applications. In a brief statement posted Friday (May 24), Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne said two companies must be dissolved, following a national security review. The companies in question are Bluvec Technologies Inc. and Pegauni Technology Inc. “The government’s decisions are based on facts and evidence and on the advice ofCanada’s security and intelligence community, and other governmentpartners,” Champagne said in the news release. “While Canada continues to welcome foreign direct investment, we will act decisively when investments threaten our national security.” Bluvec, based in Burnaby, makes a drone detection system, which has potential military applications. As reported by Glacier Media last year, Bluvec was successfully sued by another Burnaby drone detection company , Skycope Technologies for stealing proprietary source code. The founders of both Bluevec and Skycope were friends who originally worked for the same cybersecurity company in China, according B.C. Supreme Court documents. The principals of Bluvec identified in the lawsuit are Junfeng Jia (aka Jack Jia), Leyuan Pan (aka Michael Pan), Kunyu Zhang (aka Eric Zhang) and Qianqi Zhuang (aka Tim Zhuang). Also listed as defendants in the case were Xiaoqian Wu (aka Karl Wu) and Jiawei Li. The principal of Skyscope Technologies is Zhenhua (Eric) Liu, according to the court ruling. The court case notes that both Bluvec and Skyscope developed technology that “enables users to detect and block or ‘jam’ unwanted drones.” Bluvec and two of its principals – Junfeng Jia and Leyuan Pan – were ordered to pay Skycope Technologies $800,000 for breaching employment agreements with Skycope. Reached for comment, a spokesperson for Bluvec said Jack Jia was unavailable.",

        "content": "Despite 64 per cent of Africans expressing confidence in the continent, they remain loyal to brands outside of the continent, says Brand Africa in its latest Africa 100: Africa’s Best Brands research and rankings. The report also revealed that African nations account for 64 per cent of the Top 50 most admired countries, with South Africa, Nigeria, the United States, China, and Kenya the top 5 countries perceived to contribute to a better Africa. The report added: “All members of the newly expanded 9-member BRICS block, except Iran, made the list, that’s dominated by Southern and West Africa which account for 44 per cent of the Top 50 nations Africans admire globally.” According to the findings, South African telecommunications group, MTN, Nigerian conglomerate, Dangote, Zambian consumer group, Trade Kings, Nigerian telecommunications group, Glo, South African media group, DStv and Ethiopian Airlines retain their respective positions as the Top 5 most admired African brands. It added that 14 per cent African share in the ranking came from six countries – South Africa and Nigeria scored five points each, Ethiopia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania one point each. The report showed Europe retained its 37% share of the Top 100, while North America declined 12.5 per cent to 28 per cent as Asia grew its share by 23.5 per cent to capture 21 per cent of the African market. According to the ranking, Nike, Adidas, Samsung, Coca Cola and Apple have all retained their positions for the 5th consecutive year as the Top 5 most admired brands in Africa. The report noted: “In an interesting insight, affirming how entrenched non-African brands are in Africa, many such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Samsung, Lacoste, Total (Energies) and Guinness are mistakenly recalled among the most admired ‘African’ brands when the question is asked, ‘What African brands do you admire?” Among organisations, UNICEF (originally called the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund) and UN, are the most admired NGOs, Coca-Cola is the most admired non-African organization, and MTN is the number one African brand. “While the share of African brands remains a disappointing 14 per cent, with Africans overwhelmingly believing that mostly Africa will contribute to a better Africa, as nations continue to create an enabling environment for African entrepreneurs and the AfcFTA opportunity is realized, it’s just a matter of time, but ultimately the share of African brands will increase,” says Thebe Ikalafeng, founder and chairman of Brand Africa. Recognising that brands are a vector of a nation or organisation’s identity, reputation competitiveness, every year, since 2011, Brand Africa, through its independent research partners, Kantar, Geopoll across sub-Sahara Africa, Integrate in North Africa, and Analysis in the East African Islands, conducts research in over 30 markets which account for as much as 85 per cent of the continent’s GDP and population. The results are published as the lead cover story in the June edition of African Business, the continent’s foremost business magazine since 1966. Over the next few weeks, Brand Africa will release country-specific results in key countries across the continent.",

        "content": "....Targets Displeased Voters, Others As Nigeria grapples with the best solution to address issues in the country, African Democratic Congress (ADC) on Monday said that the right set of leaders will change the situation in the country. This is even as the party further said that it’s desirous of ensuring that voters, who are displeased with the outcome of last election, are encouraged to engage the process in future polls. Speaking at the opening of a retreat for ADC executives tagged: “What Nigerian Voter Want – A Strategic Public Engagement,” the former presidential hopeful of the party, Chukwuka Monye, who is also a Board of Trustees (BoT) member of the party said that ADC wants to do something different by hearing from Nigerians so that they can go back and think and come up with practical solutions. Speaking on the voter apathy, Monye said many Nigerians are not happy with the way the elections turned out and that some won’t want to come back and participate in the process again. He said: “We need to know if they would come back and on what basis they would return to vote again. “ADC will listen and develop game plans based on what the panellists tell us.” He added that the recommendations will form a basis for ADC development road plan, adding that the gathering was important because what Nigerians want is what matters. According to him, some of the members on the panel are drivers, market women, and other people from regular walks of life. He said: “They are important to us. Not many parties out there seek to understand what Nigerians want. ADC is thinking about the operations of the party not waiting till 2027.” Monye, who stressed that getting the right set of leaders will change the situation in Nigeria, added that the issues of leadership accountability and voter apathy will be deliberated on during the retreat. On his part, ADC National Chairman, Ralph Okey Nwosu said, “we want to hear from all the people that have attended.” He said the gathering will be held around the country, adding that it will enable the party to work out policies based on the feedback they get.",

The 47-year-old make-up designer was married to 48-year-old Ant from 2006 until 2018 and stood by him when he battled drug and alcohol addictions. Together, they share a chocolate Labrador named Hurley - and while they have shared custody of him since their explosive split, things are tipped to change. Over the bank holiday weekend, however, Lisa appeared to let her hair down and forget her custody worries as she relaxed with friends. Lisa - who is the head make-up designer on the smash BBC show Strictly Come Dancing - got dressed up and dazzled with a bright smile as she enjoyed a girls’ night out. The beauty expert and two friends posed together for a social media snap as they attended an event run by So Oxford and as they partied together. Lisa stunned in a pair of black lace trousers and a low cut top that featured floral prints. She later shared a quote via Instagram Stories simply stating: \"If it makes you happy then it's not a waste of time.\" Lisa enjoyed a night out with friends over the bank holiday weekend ( Image: Instagram) Lisa and ex-husband Ant McPartlin divorced in 2018 ( Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock) Virgin Media offers gamers the chance to get £250 but you'll need to act quickly In recent weeks, Lisa has made reference to the changes in her former husband’s life. After leaving Lisa, Ant coupled up with PA Anne-Marie Corbett and he later married her in 2021. This year, the couple welcomed their first child together. Fans noted that Lisa shared a string of quotes via social media that could have been interpreted as a response to her ex’s happy news. One quote shared by the star said: \"Be proud of how you have been handling these past few months. The silent battles you've fought, the moments you've had to humble yourself, the times you've wiped your own tears. Celebrate your strength.\" She later shared a quote attributed to the late Winston Churchill which read: \"I no longer listen to what people say, I just watch what they do. Behaviour never lies.\" Social behaviour and relationships expert Judi James said of the posts: \"Lisa's posts sound cryptic, a very tiny wave to the fans to hint at her feelings. Her first 'big hint' came following the birth and it reads like a motivational pep talk someone had sent her. \"Her hint is presumably that it was accurate about the 'humbling yourself' and 'wiping your own tears'. Without writing a personal description of her feelings and emotions, this post seems to suggest that is what Lisa has been going through.\" Meanwhile, reports this month have suggested Lisa is preparing to battle Ant for sole custody of their dog. The make-up expert - who won a reported £31 million in her divorce - has been turning to her pooch for comfort. A source told The Sun: “She felt very betrayed by both Ant and Anne-Marie and felt that none of this has been handled sensitively, especially the announcement of the baby. She’s really been through it all in the past seven years and sometimes she amazes herself how strong she’s been. But the one thing that has got her through it and been by her side constantly is Hurley – she doesn’t know what she would do without him. He’s more than just a dog to her and has been a lifeline at times.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads.",

        "description": "The local iwi has placed a rāhui over the inner harbour until Thursday morning.",
        "content": "Rescue crews have found the body of the man believed to have fallen overboard on a Wellington ferry. A police spokesperson said the discovery was made in Wellington Harbour yesterday evening by the Police Dive Squad, with help from the Royal New Zealand Navy. The search-and-rescue mission was sparked on Friday after the sole passenger aboard the 6am sailing from Queens Wharf to Days Bay was nowhere to be found as the vessel approached its destination. Up to 14 vessels and a rescue helicopter scoured Wellington Harbour on Friday when the man was first reported missing. Police were urgently seeking information to identify the man. The spokesperson said inquiries would continue today, including the formal identification of the man. A rāhui has been placed over the inner harbour and local iwi Te Āti Awa said a karakia. The rāhui will stay in place until Thursday morning at 6am. “The iwi request that kaimoana is not taken from the inner harbour out of respect for the whānau pain [grieving family] as they face the challenge ahead of them,” a police spokesperson said. “A number of inquiries still need to be made, and at this time Police are unable to comment further.” On Friday, deputy harbourmaster Patrick Atwood said he understood ferry staff had called for help upon noticing the passenger was missing. East by West Ferries general manager Mat Jonsson said the ferry crew issued a mayday call and began to search as soon as they became aware the passenger was missing. “We called in a second harbour ferry to assist with the search, which was joined by other vessels responding to the mayday.” Maritime New Zealand Rescue Co-ordination Centre NZ co-ordinated the on-water search effort using detailed modelling and analysis of the harbour, Greater Wellington Regional Council said. “The Greater Wellington whānau is deeply saddened by this incident. Our thoughts are with the crew of the 6am sailing and East by West staff as well,” chairman Daran Ponter said. Share this article",

        "content": "The coalition Government is pushing hard to pass a bill allowing councils to disestablish Māori wards or to hold polls on whether the ward should be continued. The bill has passed its first reading in Parliament. The proposed referendums will be held during 2025 elections and results will be binding, taking effect in the local government term in 2028. In 2022 Labour abolished the requirement for councils to hold a referendum before creating Māori wards to ensure the government would respect the Treaty partnership through Māori representation in local government decision-making. That resulted in Aotearoa going from three councils with Māori wards to 49. Opponents have described the lack of referendums as undemocratic and divisive. Stuff featured an article by New Plymouth councillor Dinnie Moeahu, who argued Māori wards were a democratic tool that ensured proportional representation and that equitable opportunities were part of the democracy. And Dr Annie Te One said that without Māori wards, Māori were consistently underrepresented, “which means our ability to actually develop a sustainable Te Tiriti o Waitangi governance framework is also not able to be done, so really they are democratic and good for everyone”. In response to Local Government Minister Simeon Brown’s announcement in April that the Government would bring back the referendum, the Waitangi Tribunal held an urgent inquiry, Wai3365, and found the Crown had breached Te Tiriti by failing to consult with Māori. It found the legislation would likely raise human rights issues under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and breach the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. Breaches detailed in the report are as follows: * the principle of partnership; * the duty to act in good faith; * the Crown’s duty to actively protect the rights and interests of Māori; * the principle of equity; * the principle of mutual benefit; * the duty to consult with Māori; and * the breach of options - that being the option of Māori voters to choose whether to be represented by general or Māori wards councillors. The public has until tomorrow to submit on the Local Government (Electoral Legislation and Māori Wards and Māori Constituencies) Amendment Bill. Share this article",

Speaking in a recent interview with BET, Tiwa disclosed that fans often pit her against every rising female artist, claiming that they are coming to take her “throne.” Speaking further, the mother of one said she would go out of her way and make friends with the new female artists instead because she believes music is not a competition. She said, “Fans always try to pit me against other female artists. Any new female artist that comes up, they would be like, ‘Yo, she is coming to take her throne.’ “And I would go out of my way to make friends with them (new female artists) because it is not a competition. The real competition is the male artists. “I was happy that Tyla, a female artist won the maiden Best African Music Performance category at the Grammys over the male nominees.”",

        "description": "Arthritis is a common condition plaguing the elderly, making even the easiest daily tasks unthinkable. Most patients resort to taking pain killers and applying balms for a temporary relief from pain. Acupuncture has proven to be a very successful, cost efficient and a harmless medical procedure for many years. This method of treatment has attracted the attention of many with its remarkable results. This ancient medical practice has been used to treat arthritis by modern doctors; yielding great success. By needling, the patient feels a great relief from pain. And upon concurrent sessions the pain reduces drastically.

        "content": "Robin Swann has recently returned as Stormonts health minister (Image: Liam McBurney/PA) Drastic spending cuts in the healthcare service would still leave a £189million budget deficit, Robin Swann has warned. The Health Minister has told Executive ministers and members of the health committee that “deep dive” cuts to health spending would not avoid a multimillion-pound overspend in the department. Mr Swann sent the letter and cost-saving analysis by the health trusts in Northern Ireland, seen by the PA news agency, on the eve of a key Assembly debate on the budget. Read more: Special school principal tells parents 'don't blame staff' ahead of closures Read more: NI Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris won’t stand in General Election The budget has already been approved by the wider Executive and is expected to be approved by the Assembly. The health service has been allocated more than half of the Executive’s £14.5 billion resource budget. Mr Swann had bid for an additional £1 billion for health – an amount that represented the entirety of the uncommitted funding available for distribution among all Stormont departments. Instead, an additional £500 million was allocated by the Stormont Executive in late April. Health trusts in Northern Ireland had been asked to work up cost-saving plans as part of efforts to bridge the gap, but Mr Swann has said these spending projections had confirmed “my worst fears about the consequences of the budget”. He warned that no Ulster Unionist Party health minister would approve cost-saving measures “with such catastrophic impacts”. UUP deputy leader Robbie Butler has said the party would not quit the Executive, but Mr Swann’s warning on Monday raises the possibility of the health minister overspending his budget in the current financial year.

Mr Swann wrote to his fellow Executive ministers: “The assessment details that even after extensive deep dive savings measures, a remaining deficit of £189m is anticipated. “That estimated deficit is in addition to the fact that no funding is provided in the Executive’s budget for staff pay increases, meaning further industrial action is all but inevitable in the year ahead.” The analysis by trusts said possible “contingency” savings measures included recruitment freezes for “non-frontline” staff and further reductions in agency and locum costs, but the analysis states that such savings “will be challenging in a single year and may not be achievable in their entirety”. “This leaves a remaining and significant deficit of £189m (assuming no pay increase in 2024/25),” it said, but warned that this level of savings “cannot be achieved without high/catastrophic impact measures”. It said that all trusts had expressed “grave concerns” about the impact on health and social care services at both local and regional level if such savings measures were to be requested. Some of the “projected” requirements include a reduction of around 400 acute hospital beds across Northern Ireland, a reduction of around 1,200 staff; an estimated reduction of 1,100,000 hours of homecare/domiciliary care type support over a year; and an estimated reduction of around 500 care home beds. It said that a more detailed assessment will be needed on contingency plans and ministerial approval would be needed for high/catastrophic impact measures. Mr Swann called the analysis both “hugely concerning” and “fair and balanced”. “It is the most alarming advice I have received in my time as Minister, outside of the Covid-19 pandemic.” Urging his Stormont colleagues to reconsider the vote on the budget, Mr Swann added: “Both before and after the latest restoration of the local institutions, promises were made and commitments were given that the health of our people would be prioritised. This budget does not do that. “Even without implementing the most damaging cost saving measures, this budget will make the challenges in our health worse instead of better.” Join our Belfast Live breaking news service on WhatsApp Click this link or scan the QR code to receive breaking news and top stories from Belfast Live.

        "content": "May 27, (THEWILL) – The National Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE) has declared persona non grata at the general manager of Turkish airlines, Mr Lookman Balkan, refuting claims seven Nigerian staff sacked by the airline were involved in $600,000 ticket racketeering. In a statement signed by Ochene Aba, General Secretary of NUATE, on Monday, the union said the “accusations are blatant and poorly formulated lies.” The airline had claimed last week that it dismissed seven Nigerian staff because they violated various ticketing reservation rules, costing the airline significant economic loss to the tune of over $600,000. But the union explained that the “claim that the airline lost $600,000 is mere phantom.” NUATE explained further that sometime in April 2023, Turkish Airlines’ headquarters issued a sales restriction circular which allowed sales of only two premium classes of tickets, as a response to foreign airlines’ difficulty in repatriating their proceeds to home countries due to foreign exchange constraints in Nigeria. It added that, however, “In a contradicting manner, the Airline had an advertised fare on the website which was much lower than the permitted fares. Therefore, intending passengers who accessed such fare, but could not pay online were directed by the global call centre to approach the Nigerian offices, adding that as the workers could not attend to the customers due to the sales restriction, the passengers resorted to creating ugly scenes at the sales offices which became riotous at times. “As an image saving measure, the then sales manager asked the sales staff to use the PNR obtained online by the customers to process the tickets if the Airline’s booking system could route the tickets. The sales staff simply complied. As a matter of fact, the then sales manager, a Turkish national, sold these tickets too to confirm that this was the local management’s approved approach to resolving the problem created by the website. “The Airline’s accountants received all due monies from all tickets sold and all sales report were daily submitted to sales manager, signed by him and accounts department and scanned to Headquarters. If monies were not fully received, the account would not have balanced, and sales could not have been concluded. Therefore, no monies belonging to Turkish Airlines is missing. And no staff has taken any monies belonging to Turkish Airlines. Importantly, no staff had any pecuniary benefit from the so called internet sales. “It is, therefore, disingenuous for the General Manager to hold the workers to the charge of failure to comply with the sales restrictions when it is clear that shortcomings on the part of the Airlines ICT (on the website) combined with Local Management’s decisions on managing an otherwise ugly situation were responsible for the sales in question”, it said. The Union also said it did not agree with the Management’s positions or its findings, adding that “at the so-called disciplinary hearing, the union made it absolutely clear that the committee could only be used as a fact finding means as it was not formed in conformity with the negotiated Conditions of Service.” It added that the coercive actions on the part of the General Manager has seriously and negatively impacted the mental health of all staff of the Airline, causing a number of them to resign without any benefit whatsoever and forfeiting over ten years of service. “We wish to use this medium to inform the general public and relevant stakeholders that the real reason for the sack of the seven out of eleven employees under these trump up charges is the continued determination to exterminate the union from the Airline which it started in 2020 when it sacked all the members of the Airline’s Branch Executive Council of the Union, a matter that it has refused to rectify till date. “Finally, NUATE wishes to state that the high-handedness, plain wickedness and undiluted arrogance of Mr. Lookman Balkan, the General Manager of Turkish Airlines in Lagos makes him totally unfit to hold such important position as to manage people. He has demonstrated total disdain for Nigerians and Nigerian laws – even aviation laws. “On our part, however, NUATE has declared Lookman Balkan persona non grata. We shall instruct all aviation workers not to handle him at any Nigerian airport, except at his exit from Nigeria. And if compelled, NUATE shall internationalise his ostracising from the global aviation family”, it concluded Anthony Awunor, is a business correspondent who holds a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Linguistics (UNILAG). He is also an alumnus of the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT), Zaria Kaduna State. He lives in Lagos.",

        "content": "Many of the seedlings that were planted in areas that experienced floods were affected, the Kenya Forest Service has revealed. Chief Conservator of Forest Alex Lemarkoko said seedlings in Samburu county were flooded by water from the heavy rainfall. He, however, said the trees regained life after the rain flood waters receded. Lemarkoko encouraged people take advantage of the rains and plant more trees in support of President William Ruto's vision of achieving 30 per cent tree cover by 2032. \"Forests and areas where rain waters were not stagnating, seedlings survived well,\" he said. Lemarkoko noted that over 150 million trees have been planted this year by KFS and their partners, stakeholders and environmentalists. He spoke at KFS headquarters at Karura on Monday when the service unveiled the revised copies of the Code of Ethics, 2024. Lemarkoko was accompanied by Regional Coordinator for Africa Environment Team Giovanni Borussard and other KFS senior staff. \"We need to do the activities we conduct in the best way. We shall guide our staff,\" he said. The chief conservator said the document will help officers serve with more accountability and transparency. He applauded the KFS staff and workers for the notable decrease in corruption-related cases, attributing it to the collective goodwill of the staff. Lemarkoko further called on the leadership of the KFS to embark on blocking corruption risks, threats of illegal activities and infringement of rights. The CCF also noted that they will continue safeguarding planted seedlings and forest vegetation adding that the newly added staffs have been of great assistance in patrols and surveillance.",

        "content": "Srinagar, May 27: National Board of Accreditation (NBA) granted three-year accreditation extension to two undergraduate engineering programs at National Institute of Technology Srinagar (NIT) Srinagar. As per NBA, two undergraduate courses including UG courses in Electronics & Communication Engineering and Mechanical Engineering have been accredited up to June-2027, in accordance with the ‘Accreditation of Tier I Engineering Institutions under the Washington Accord’. “An expert team conducted evaluation of the programs on 13th April 2024 to verify the data of the programs. The competent authority in NBA has decided accreditation of two programs on the basis of compliance reports for the academic years 2024-2025 to 2026-2027,” it said. In his message, Director NIT Srinagar, Prof. A. Ravinder Nath, congratulated the faculty, staff, and students on this achievement. “NIT Srinagar has a long-standing tradition of excellence, and this milestone reaffirms our position as a premier institution. We are committed to fostering an environment that nurtures innovation and excellence in engineering education,” he added. Director NIT attributed this achievement to the contributions of all faculty members, especially Dr. Gausia Qazi, Head of Electronics & Communication Engineering, Prof. Adnan Qayaom, Head of Mechanical Engineering, Chairman NBA, Prof. Manzoor Ahmad Ahanger, Coordinator Dr. Harveer Singh Pali alongwith their entire team, for their exemplary work. “It was a team effort, and all stakeholders performed their roles professionally,” he added. Institute’s Registrar, Prof. Atikur Rahman said that NBA accreditation serves as a hallmark of excellence, signifying that our institution upholds superior standards in both infrastructure and faculty expertise. “It opens doors to a plethora of opportunities for our students and faculty alike, ensuring that they are well-prepared to excel in their chosen careers and contribute meaningfully to the advancement of knowledge in their respective fields,” he said. NBA Accreditation implies that the Higher Education Institution has high-quality infrastructure and teachers. It provides better recognition from organizations for employment and research purposes. Graduating from a Tier 1 NBA Accredited program increases the chance of placements and acceptance in the higher education institutions around the globe many-folds. According to NBA, the purpose of the accreditation is to promote and recognize excellence in technical education in colleges and universities – at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. They also benefit from the process of continuous quality improvement that is encouraged by the NBA’s developmental approach to promote excellence in technical education. “It supports and advises technical institutions in the maintenance and enhancement of their quality of provision,” it added.",

        "content": "I am writing about the ADN editorial printed on May 19. You wrote that Suzanne LaFrance should not behave like the Dave Bronson administration, with an “opaque management style, incompetence and a willingness to lie to the public about its actions.” You cautioned her that she should be aware that many people did not vote for her, and she needed to also serve them. Of course, Suzanne LaFrance will be different from Dave Bronson. That’s why she spent the last year running for mayor. She is a smart analytical thinker who will hire professional managers, lead with clarity and model ethical behavior. She is a gifted listener who can make decisions in the public interest. She is a calm, courteous and articulate woman. In the debate between the candidates, LaFrance said, “It’s not about red or blue, left or right. It’s about our community. And it’s about working together. And we have this tremendous opportunity at the local level, to put aside the stuff at the state and federal level that divides us, and really make progress to make our community a better place. It’s about problem-solving,” I believe Suzanne LaFrance will be a stellar mayor who will bring us together to strengthen Anchorage so it will be a vibrant city that will entice our brightest young people to stay and build a prosperous future here. — Jane Angvik Anchorage Have something on your mind?

        "content": "Photo: The Canadian Press Alberta's police watchdog says there will be no criminal charges for two police officers who broke rules when they surveilled NDP legislature member Shannon Phillips. Phillips speaks as Rachel Notley looks on at an announcement in Calgary, Monday, March 15, 2021. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntosh Alberta's police watchdog says there will be no criminal charges for two police officers who broke rules when they surveilled a legislature member. The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team says there are reasonable grounds to believe two Lethbridge police officers committed offences when they did a criminal record check on local New Democrat MLA Shannon Phillips. But it says the Alberta Prosecution Service determined the circumstances didn't meet its test to go to court. The information is contained in a letter from the agency to the politician's lawyer, Michael Bates. The issue began in 2017, when an officer overheard Phillips discussing environmental issues in a coffee shop. He texted a fellow officer and the two subsequently searched Phillips in police databases and photographed and followed her. The two officers received temporary demotions.",

        "content": "The estranged wife of Nigerian singer, Harrysong, Alexer Peres has hit hard on the singer following his infidelity allegations against her. had earlier reported that Harrysong claimed that his wife, Alexer, was unfaithful in their marriage and got pregnant for another man despite marrying her due to emotional blackmail. He also claimed that he regrets marrying into his wife’s family, claiming that infidelity runs in their family as her mother, who has been married to seven men, still cheats. Reacting to the development, Peres took to her Instagram page to debunk Harrysong’s claims, stating that her mother only remarried once after the death of her father. She also challenged the singer to come forward with evidence that she cheated on him. She went on to claim that it is Harrysong’s mum who has six children out of wedlock for six different men. Speaking further, she claimed that Harrysong was a product of incest and he bedwets. On her Instagram account, she wrote: “Do you all know that Harrysong bed wets? Yes, celebrity wey Dey piss for the body. “Oh so sorry to break it to u all. I also get to deal with this daily, while calling him my lord. “You said I convinced you to get married to me? A 20-year-old girl, convincing a full-grown man to get married to her? “Please make me understand, never knew I was married to a robot, Who couldn’t make decisions for himself. Same you who told me your ex-girlfriend used charms on you. “And now your eyes are open since u met me So it’s now me that forced marriage on you, really? “I never knew my mum married 6 husbands wow, chronic narcissist. “My mum only remarried when she lost her husband, as I speak, she is happily married, with her dowry paid in full. “Since when did it become a crime for a widow to remarry? And what do the words ’till death do us part’ mean? “Pained soul, why are u trying to project your insecurities on me? We all know your mum gave birth to 6 children for 6 different men. None of which she was married to. “And you, a product of incest. Imagine having 5 siblings and you don’t knowing who their fathers are. “Why throw stones, when you live in a glass house?” Peres said she was open to conducting DNA tests on their children to prove her innocence. She added that the singer was the one who gave her all kinds of sexually transmitted diseases except HIV and Hepatitis B.",

This week: The impacts of climate misinformation and disinformation campaigns have never been more present. Between late April and early May, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil’s southernmost state, was hit by unprecedented floods. More than 70 percent of the state’s almost 500 municipalities were affected, and nearly 70,000 people are still in temporary shelters. In addition to the natural impacts of the tragedy, authorities, volunteers, and the population are having to deal with a wave of disinformation and misinformation campaigns on social media. State of play. In the first weeks of the tragedy, several false reports claimed that bureaucracy was holding up food, water, and clothing donations. Most came from civilians in or near the flooded areas (the majority of them supporters of the former president in one way or another) and right-wing social influencers. Yes, but ... Elected officials also spread some of them, as is the case with Congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of former President Jair Bolsonaro and a representative of Steve Bannon’s far-far-right movement in Brazil. By the numbers. As the catastrophe evolved and the situation became more serious, false narratives proliferated. A study by NetLab, an internet and social media research laboratory at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, identified at least eight fake news narratives on social media posts and ads.

        "content": "OTTAWA — Ottawa is developing a new artificial intelligence strategy for federal government operations, Treasury Board President Anita Anand said Monday. \"It is a big step towards a cohesive and consistent federal approach to AI,\" Anand said at a meeting of AI experts in Gatineau, Que., where the strategy is being discussed. The intention is to make government operations more efficient and improve services for Canadians, while also improving capacity for science and research. Anand said the question is about how to \"add greater efficiencies but also simplify the interactions of the Canadian population and organizations and businesses with federal services.\" She said AI could be used to automate routine tasks, but said generative AI “isn’t generally going to be used” when it comes to confidential uses like those involving containing cabinet confidences. The effort is not about reducing the number of jobs in the federal public service, she said. The initiative will include setting up a specific division to retrain existing public servants. Anand said the government will also work on hiring \"quickly and competitively\" to bring in more top tech talent. In addition to Monday's meeting of experts, the government will consult broadly in the coming months before unveiling the strategy. There is no deadline for producing the strategy. The federal government has already begun incorporating AI into its operations, using the technology in hundreds of different ways. As the largest employer in Canada, the federal government sets an example for employers in the private sector, Anand said. She said there is a need for balance when it comes to responsibly using AI, which includes ensuring that privacy laws are respected and that AI isn't used for \"discriminatory or unsavoury\" purposes. The announcement came as eight more private organizations signed on to a voluntary federal code of conduct for artificial intelligence, including Mastercard, Lenovo and the Quebec real-estate brokers' association. Adopters of the code launched last year must agree to undertake several measures aimed at reducing the risks of AI, including screening data sets for potential biases and monitoring systems for possible harms.

        "content": "(iStock / Getty Images) Question: My world fell apart three weeks after I started my new job. My husband left me and while I was still reeling from the pain, my teenage daughter informed me she’d rather live with him. I told her absolutely not. The next day, she returned home after I left for work, packed her things, and left. That night, as I sat in shock, my soon-to-be-ex called to gloat. Even though my logical mind tells me my job had nothing to do with my daughter leaving, the fact remains she left my home while I was at work. It took me more than a month to pull myself together. During those early days. I cried a lot, even during the workday, and once during a staff meeting. I was distracted, made errors, and missed deadlines. My supervisor pulled me aside twice, and I confessed everything to her. She was remarkably understanding, but told me to “get a grip.” I’ve since pulled myself together, but yesterday received a new blow, a strongly worded written reprimand warning me if I repeat any of my problem behaviors, I’ll be fired immediately. Here’s my question: Should I resign and find a new job, where I don’t have this history and can have a fresh start? Answer : You can, and this may prove your best alternative. If you take this route, you might want to land your new job first, so you don’t risk finding yourself without a job, and alone at home without your daughter. Further, while leaving a problematic history often feels tempting, a quick change tosses you into even more instability. Alternatively, you can seize the opportunity your employer gave you and create the fresh start you seek. Consider these three facts: One, your employer didn’t fire you. Instead, they offered you a second chance. This says a lot about your employer—not all employers give new employees the benefit of the doubt. Two, you wanted this job. That means you assessed it, and while you could have waited for another job offer, something about this position and employer drew you. Do you want to start at ground zero again, hoping you’ll find something better? Three, we make a new history every day. While we only have one chance to make a first impression, if you immediately and consistently treat your job and coworkers with professionalism, you can create a fresh start with this employer and these coworkers. Here’s how: Get back in the game. Hit your emotional reset button. As just one example, your email said, “the fact remains she left my home while I was at work.” You won’t work with full enthusiasm if you hold your job responsible for your teen’s decision. You’ve had a rough month and paid the price. From this moment forward, aim become a better person, employee and mother. Squeeze value out of what’s happened. Given you’re heading into a divorce and a troubled relationship with your teen, what do you now know to do differently so your emotions don’t swamp you at work? For example, can you decide you’ll treat going to work as a daily eight-hour vacation from the hot mess your personal life has become? Additionally, call in the cavalry—line up a therapist or other support person so you have someone in your corner who can help you stay grounded. Finally, rebuild trust. You’ve weakened your employer’s and co-workers’ confidence in you. While you can’t erase the past, you can reassure your supervisor and peers you’re once again in it to win it. Let your supervisor know you’re aware your company paid a price for your errors and missed deadlines, and you’ll work hard to ensure they receive their payback. In short, create your fresh start.",

        "content": "Coronation Street fans have made their feelings clear - as Lauren Bolton's murderer was finally 'revealed'. The ITV soap is airing a very special week of episodes to coincide with the Britain's Got Talent semi-finals as we finally learn what happened to Lauren Bolton on the night she disappeared. The police, led by DS Swain, are convinced she is dead after finding a blood stained leg of a chair in her flat, but is that what happened, or is she still alive? The soap has been teasing a huge week for the show, as Roy's hell in prison comes to a nasty head whilst Nathan Curtis finds himself firmly on the radar for Lauren's disappearance and murder, when Sarah tries to get involved. This week, soap fans will watch on as the first four episodes will show the same day through different character's eyes, and the truth of what really happened to Lauren will be revealed. Tonight, the story focused around Sarah and her desperation to help her daughter Bethany be rid of her evil abuser Nathan for good - but what lengths will she go to to get him locked up? Is Nathan to blame for what happened to Lauren? ( Image: ITV) Speaking about the huge scenes, executive Producer Iain MacLeod, shared: \"This week is so gripping and unlike anything Coronation Street has done before, in terms of the story-telling. It’s modern, really exciting and has some of our favourite characters right in the middle of the drama. The murder mystery around Lauren has had us all on the edge of our seats and the race against time across this week to solve it before Roy gets seriously hurt is so engrossing and cleverly plotted. It is also the launchpad for a massive new chapter in that narrative - so you really won’t want to miss it, if you want to carry on trying to piece together this thrilling puzzle!\" Taking to social media tonight, fans gave their thoughts on the big scenes - as they underwent a huge format change for the special week of episodes when all is set to be revealed about Lauren's shock disappearance and death. \"Why is the colour weird ? Is it a dream? #corrie ,\" one wrote on Twitter, whilst a second added: \"s there some weird filter going on here #corrie .\" A third penned: \"That intro gives me the chills omfg #corrie ,\" with a fourth adding on Twitter: \"Don’t think I like this camera work ! #Corrie .\" A fifth wrote: \"This is rivalling Hollyoaks with this level of cinematography #corrie .\" * Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .",

It would be recalled that the relationship between Justin Dean and his ex-wife, Korra is a topic of frequent social media conversations. Following his divorce from his wife, a series of accusations have been flying around on the internet from both ends. New Telegraph recalls that a few weeks earlier, Dean accused Korra of adultery, saying that she had cheated on him when their daughter was still a pregnant woman. Justin Dean claims that Korra went to Nigeria for a friend’s wedding and cheated on her fiancé while there. Shortly after the birth of their second child, in March 2022, the couple’s marriage came to an official halt. In a new development, Justin Dean came to Facebook to consider the previous two years of his life online as the most trolled. Their public arguments and allegations against one another throughout their separation have garnered a lot of attention on social media. See his post below;",

        "description": "Crayfish which sold for N4,500 for five-litre containers in the third week of April, now sells for N10,000 for the same quantity.The post Crayfish, garri prices soar as hardship bites harder in Akwa Ibom appeared first on Premium Times Nigeria.",
        "content": "The price of crayfish, a condiment used for soup making, has ballooned by over 100 per cent in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, as hardship bites harder. Like other seafood, crayfish is rich in nutritional value and is a good source of low-fat protein, essential vitamins and minerals including phosphorus, magnesium and zinc. PREMIUM TIMES survey of markets and shops in the fourth week of May shows that crayfish which sold for N4,500 for five-litre containers in the third week of April, now sells for N10,000 for the same quantity, recording an increase of 122 per cent in the month. Besides crayfish, the price of garri, a major staple food, has recorded a marginal increase within the same period. The survey shows that the garri, which was sold for two and a half cups for N500 and five cups for N1, 000 now sells for two cups for N500 and four cups for N1, 000. The price of staple foods has continued to increase in the state despite an intervention by the state government through the bulk purchase agency – a newly established department through which 5kg of staple food items including rice, garri and beans are shared with vulnerable persons captured in the state social register. A mother of four, Glory Akpan, who was at Itam market to buy foodstuffs for her family some days ago, told this reporter that it was shocking that a crayfish portion for N100 has disappeared from the market.

Mrs Akpan who wanted to buy crayfish for N1, 000 was forced to buy for N2,000 but lamented that it might be okay for what she wanted to prepare. Responding to concerns raised by her customer, the crayfish vendor, who gave her name simply as “Mfon” said there might not be a crayfish portion for N200 from June unless something is done. Asked what should be done, she identified transportation fares and the cost of diesel which the fishermen used for fishing. “The hardship is biting harder,” a young lady, Uduak Akpan, who was at the market to buy foodstuffs, lamented. Ms Akpan described the increase in the price of crayfish as “disturbing” but said no matter the price Nigerians would still buy in silence. PREMIUM TIMES, however, observed prices of other commodities like beans, rice and oil have remained stable as at last reported in April. Agriculture, security and rural development aimed at stemming the tide of rural-urban migration are top priorities in Governor Umo Eno’s blueprint – “Arise Agenda.” In his inaugural address a year ago, Mr Eno identified agriculture as the “new black gold” and promised that his government would “invest heavily” and “cause revolution to occur in the sector.” “Food security and investments in the agro-allied sector will be an abiding article of faith. We will deploy our comparative advantage in the blue economy, and ensure that our fishermen get proper financial value for their work,” the governor had said. But a year into his administration, the security situation in the state both on land and in the waterways has worsened and fishermen are not getting financial value for their work as promised by the governor. Crayfish vendors identified sea pirates as a major reason for the ballooning price of the seafood. Otobong Kenjoshua, a foodstuffs vendor in Afaha Ube Road in Uyo and Emem Augustine, blamed the increase in the scarcity of crayfish on the skyrocketed price of petrol and sea pirates. “The fishermen are complaining of attacks by sea pirates,” a development they said does not allow them access to the high sea. The fishermen, Mrs KenJoshua said also complained about spending so much to buy petrol without making a commensurate catch, a cost they (fishermen) transfer to the customers. According to her, a bag (18kg) of crayfish that was sold for N150,000 in April now sells at N260,000 for the same amount. “Fuel is the major problem now, that is why the prices of commodities are increasing. Once the price of fuel drops, everything will align,” she said, suggesting that prices of commodities may not drop as the price of petrol has witnessed a 400 per cent increase since President Bola Tinubu declared an end to subsidy a year ago. The attacks on the fishermen have been on the increase after the state government last December handed over 14 gunboats to the Nigerian Navy to boost maritime security. The National Coordinator, Akwa Ibom Human Rights Community, Clifford Thomas, said the commissioners are interpreting the governor’s vision in the sector well. “The governor has plans that have not been fully understood and interpreted not to talk of implementation,” he told PREMIUM TIMES just as lamented the high cost of crayfish despite Akwa Ibom having the longest coastline in the country. Mr Thomas, a lawyer, said the crayfish business in the state is dominated by non-indigenes, the basis, he said, it’s price has skyrocketed. “About crayfish, people from neighbouring states are in charge of the crayfish industry in Akwa Ibom State. Why can’t the governor quietly go in and look at what the problems of fishermen are and then get them those fishing gear and let them know how they can repay? “A bag of crayfish shouldn’t be sold at N135,000 again, but N80,000 and the people who buy should be our people not those from neighbouring states. “We have the product but we are suffering from availability. People from neighbouring states come in, buy the boats, and fishing gear and give to our people – this is what you will make and this is the much I will pay you. They might sell it at N80,000 in Aba but N130,000 in Uyo because whoever pays the piper dictates its tune,” Mr Clifford said. The State Commissioner for Internal Security and Waterways, Koko Essien, did not respond to phone calls for comments. Timfon John, the police spokesperson in the state, when contacted told PREMIUM TIMES that the command was aware of the fishermen being attacked by sea pirates. Ms John said the commissioner of police had mobilised operatives to arrest the situation. At Premium Times, we firmly believe in the importance of high-quality journalism.
