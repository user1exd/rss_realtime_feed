Acknowledging that his grief was not the same as that of families who lost loved ones during the course of their military service, Joe Biden told those in the audience that he understood \"how hard it can be to reopen that black hole in the middle of your chest\" whenever they remember them. \"As it is for so many of you, the pain of his loss is with me every day, still sharp, still clear,\" he said Monday. Beau Biden, a former Delaware state attorney general who reached the rank of major in the Judge Advocate General's Corps before he died from brain cancer in 2015 at the age of 46, was awarded a Bronze Star Medal for his yearlong service in Iraq . Joe Biden has repeated that his son's cancer was caused by his exposure to toxic burn pits while he was abroad. Biden also indirectly alluded to former President Donald Trump with a statement of the importance of democracy and respecting those who serve or have served. \"We gather at this sacred place for this solemn moment to remember, to honor, the sacrifice of the hundreds of thousands of women and men who have given their lives to this nation,\" he said. \"Each one bound by a common commitment, not to a place, not to a person, not to a president, but to an idea unlike any idea in human history: the idea of the United States.\" Earlier Monday, Biden hosted a Memorial Day breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leadership, veterans, and Gold Star family members before taking part in the wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier with Vice President Kamala Harris , Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin , and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Charles Q. Brown, Jr . \"Thanks to our fallen, the bedrock of our liberty remains unshaken,\" Brown said during the event at the nearby Memorial Amphitheater. \"It's up to us to further the cause for which our fallen died and uphold the freedoms for which they fought.\" \"In the end, America's greatest strategic asset will always be our people,\" Austin said. \"So let us always remember our fallen heroes and let us always strive to defend the democracy, [for] which they fought and die. They did their duty and we must too.\" CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Earlier, Joe Biden marked the holiday by spending time with the widow of Beau Biden, Hallie Olivere, in Delaware on Sunday.",

        "content": "Business in Cameroon | Fitch Ratings maintained Cameroon’s long-term foreign currency rating at “B” in its recent assessment published on May 17, 2024. This decision reflects a diversified regional economy and robust GDP growth. However, Fitch has downgraded the outlook from stable to negative. The agency said the state debt of Cameroon, including guarantees, arrears, and debts of the National Refining Company (Sonara), is expected to decrease to 39.2% of GDP by 2025, down from 43.2% of GDP at the end of 2023. This performance, significantly below the median expected “B” rating of 52.3%, is attributed to robust nominal GDP growth and low fiscal deficits. Despite these positive aspects, Fitch highlighted ongoing debt management issues. Cameroon temporarily accumulated a moderate amount of external arrears to the European Investment Bank (EIB) in August and September 2023, before settling all external arrears in a matter of days. This is a further non-compliance with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) target of no external arrears after 0.1% of GDP in 2022 and 0.2% of GDP in the first half of 2023, according to the agency. Persistent weaknesses in public finance management are also underscored by Fitch, with poor cash management and underestimated expenditures, notably fuel subsidies and unplanned security expenses, leading to off-budget expenditures and the accumulation of previous arrears. Although the stock of domestic arrears decreased to 0.6% in 2023 from 0.7% of GDP in 2022, it increased to 1.6% by the end of March 2024. Furthermore, Fitch noted that the government’s debt deficit narrowed to 0.6% in 2023 based on commitments, down from 1.1% of GDP in 2022, due to higher revenues, lower capital expenditure execution, and the deferral of fuel subsidies (0.4% of GDP) to 2024. On a cash basis, Fitch estimated that the deficit decreased to 0.4% of GDP in 2023 from 1.2% in 2022, with net arrears amounting to 0.2% of GDP. The agency forecasted that Cameroon’s financing needs will rise to 5.2% of GDP in 2024 and 4.6% in 2025, up from 4.3% in 2023, due to higher cash deficits. External debt amortization will average 1.9% of GDP in 2024 and 2025, including an annual Eurobond payment of 0.1% of GDP. IMF programs will provide access to financing and support reform efforts. Fitch also forecasts that the current account deficit will average 3.9% of GDP in 2024, compared to an estimated 4.0% in 2023. In political terms, the uncertainty surrounding the next presidential elections scheduled for 2025 contributes to the negative outlook. President Paul Biya, re-elected in 2018 for a seventh term, could run again, increasing political risk in an already tense political climate, according to the rating agency. Despite these challenges, Cameroon is showing resilient economic growth, with GDP growth forecasts of 3.9% in 2024 and 4.1% in 2025, driven by non-oil sectors such as agriculture, forestry, transport and energy infrastructure. By maintaining Cameroon’s “B” rating with a negative outlook, Fitch Ratings acknowledged both the country’s strengths and challenges. This decision comes amid varied positions taken by other rating agencies. In a recent analysis, Moody’s decided to maintain a harsh rating (Caa) for Cameroon, despite projections of debt stability until 2027. On the other hand, Standard & Poor’s recently upgraded Cameroon’s rating from CCC+ (high risk) to B- (highly speculative) with stable outlooks.",

        "description": "Two-time NBA champion and NBA Hall of Famer Bill Walton has passed away following a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA has announced.",
        "content": "NEW YORK -- Two-time NBA champion and NBA Hall of Famer Bill Walton has passed away following a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA announced on Monday. Walton was surrounded by his family, according to the statement. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career - disrupted by chronic foot injuries - lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. \"One of my guards said, 'Let's try something else,\" Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden's response during that timeout: \"Why? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. \"It's very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA's program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. \"As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It's hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.\" The first overall pick of the 1974 NBA draft by the Portland Trail Blazers, the 6-foot-11 Walton played 10 seasons in the NBA, winning championships with the Blazers (1977) and the Boston Celtics (1986). He averaged a double-double over his career, totaling 6,215 points (13.3 per game), 4,923 rebounds (10.5 per game), 1,034 blocks (2.2 per game) and 1,590 assists. A two-time All-Star, he led the NBA in rebounding and blocks in 1977 and was the league's Sixth Man of the Year in 1986. After his NBA career, Walton turned to broadcasting where he entertained generations of basketball fans. Walton originally joined ESPN in 2002 as a lead analyst for NBA games before shifting to college basketball in 2012. He was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all-time by the American Sportscasters Association in 2009.. \"But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life,\" Silver said. \"He was a regular presence at league events - always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" --- Information from the NBA, ESPN and the Associated Press",

Insights into all the reactions that have since come to light, regarding Prince Harry’s absence from the upcoming wedding have been shared by a pal. This pal in question spoke to The Times and was quoted saying, “‘It’s incredibly sad it has come to this. Hugh is one of the very few close friends of William and Harry who has maintained strong bonds... with both.” In reference to this admission Ms Rebecca English also stepped forward with her own take to the matter. She dished over everything in one of her pieces for The Daily Mai land wrote, “It’s like a game of Twister, a tangled web of turbulent toffs that has sadly been pulled apart.” “I imagine William, though outwardly beaming, will actually feel a great deal of sadness that such a happy day cannot be shared. Catherine will not be by his side, as she continues her recovery from surgery.”",

Their appearance comes after the record producer was involved in a brawl with the rapper at Richie Akiva’s annual “The After” afterparty in Cannes, France. According to Page Six , the fight broke out last Friday around 5 a.m when Travis and Alexander’s friend Tyga were both in the DJ booth at the same time. Richie pulled out the mic and gave a shout out to Tyga and Alexander saying, “We got T-Raww and A.E in the house.” This didn’t sit well with Travis who returned to the stage, allegedly pushing Alexander which prompted him to drag Travis as well. Recently, the couple was seen putting on a united front while strolling around Monaco after arriving via helicopter from St Tropez. Cher and Alexander were also seen entering the celeb favorite hotspot Club 55. Their appearance also comes after the legendary singer said that she’s working on new music with her beau. Cher told a reporter at the 2024 Cannes Festival, “He and I are gonna start a new album. We haven't started yet; he's going to produce it.”",

        "content": "Social media is amassed with funny and viral videos showing how cats react to cucumbers after seeing them suddenly near them while eating. A number of clips show that the owner of cats subtly places a cucumber when their pet is eating. After suddenly seeing a cucumber near them, cats jump and go far away, making it funny for the onlookers. An expert in animal behaviour Jill Goldman told while speaking with the National Geographic Channel that the cucumbers were triggering the cats' natural startle reflexes, reported Independent . She said while explaining cats' terrifying reaction: \"With a startle response, a cat will often try to get out of there as quickly as possible and then reassess from a distance.\" Pam Johnson-Bennett, who is the author of Think Like a Cat was also quoted by the publication that placing cucumbers near where cats eat may confuse the cats further because they often associate those areas with safety and security. Goldman added that it was also possible cats may associate the cucumber with snakes, which can be deadly predators. \"If you cause stress to an animal that's probably not a good thing,\" Goldman stated.",

        "content": "Reacting sharply to Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav’s accusations that the BJP is stealing the reservations of backward class, Dalits and tribals, Uttar Pradesh BJP President Bhupendra Singh Chaudhary said SP and INDI alliance leaders are always promoting religion-based reservations. Hitting out at SP and INDI alliance, Chaudhary said, “The leaders of Samajwadi Party and INDI alliance always talked about Muslim quota and they are promoting religion-based reservations wherever they form the government.” “When the election results come on June 4, you will not find Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi here. They will go to Bangkok or Thailand for vacation,” he further said. Speaking on the performance of the BJP in the ongoing Lok Sabha polls, Chaudhary said, “Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP is moving towards winning all the seats in Uttar Pradesh... BJP is winning all 80 seats. We will move ahead with the resolution of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make India a developed nation.” Meanwhile, Akhilesh Yadav accused the BJP of stealing the reservations of backward class, Dalits, and tribes, adding that after June 4, politics of “negativity” will be over. “They (BJP) stole the reservation of backward class, Dalits and tribes...The ‘P’ in PDA means Purvanchal, progressive; NDA is negative...They do negative politics....The time of doing negative politics is over...They are against social justice, reservation, caste census, the happiness of farmers....They not only want to take the nation backward but also put the people of the country in poverty,” Akhilesh Yadav told reporters. Uttar Pradesh is voting in all seven phases of the Lok Sabha polls, the last phase of which is scheduled on June 1. The Congress is fighting the polls in partnership with the Samajwadi Party in the state and have a seat-sharing agreement with each other. As per the seat agreement between the Samajwadi Party and Congress in Uttar Pradesh, Congress is contesting on 17 seats and the Samajwadi Party has the remaining 63 seats in the electorally crucial state. In the 2019 general elections, the BJP emerged triumphant, securing 62 out of 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh, supplemented by two seats clinched by its ally Apna Dal (S). Mayawati’s BSP managed to secure 10 seats, while Akhilesh Yadav’s SP garnered five. Conversely, the Congress party secured only one seat. The election for 543 Lok Sabha seats will be held in seven phases starting April 19. The counting of the votes will be held on June 4",

        "content": "England captain Jos Buttler is set to miss their third T20I clash against Pakistan on Tuesday in Cardiff due to paternity leave. According to ESPNcricinfo, Buttler returned to his home in London after England went ahead in the series following their 23-run win against Pakistan in the second T20I on Saturday. Buttler and his wife are expecting a child very soon. On Monday he missed England’s afternoon training session in Cardiff ahead of the third T20I on Tuesday. He will likely miss the third T20I however, it is yet to be seen if he will be available for the final clash of the series at The Oval on Thursday. Buttler had previously indicated that he would be present during the birth of his child which has raised concerns over his availability in the group stage matches of the T20 World Cup. England’s T20 World Cup defence will begin against Scotland on June 4 at the Kensington Oval in Barbados. They will then play group matches against Australia, Oman, and Namibia in Barbados and Antigua. England’s vice-captain, Moeen Ali last week gave his take on the significance of a possible leadership change. “Obviously if it happens, then it’s a great honour – as it always is. I’ll be fine. Nothing will change too much: it’s just taking over from what he’s doing and then when he comes back, he takes over,” Moeen said. “Hopefully, the baby comes at the right time where he doesn’t miss too many games. For me, it’s just whatever will happen, will happen. [Deputising] is not really difficult, to be honest with you, because we speak often, me and Jos. We talk about other things, the team, and all that. We’re on the same page anyway,” he added. Buttler was at his best during the second T20I against Pakistan with his 84-run blitz off 54 deliveries. His knock laid the foundation of England’s triumph in the second T20I. (ANI)",

        "content": "IMD has announced that this year the southwest monsoon is likely to set in over Kerala on May 31. New Delhi: India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecasted above-average monsoon rains in the country this year in its Updated Long Range Forecast Outlook on Monday, confirming its April forecast of a good monsoon. “Quantitatively, the southwest monsoon seasonal rainfall over the country as a whole is likely to be 106 per cent of the Long Period Average (LPA) with a model error of 4 per cent. Thus above normal rainfall is most likely over the country as a whole during the monsoon season from June to September 2024,” IMD said. IMD has based the forecast of the good monsoon on the fact that the strong El Nino conditions which tend to disrupt the monsoon have weakened rapidly into weak El Nino conditions and are currently transitioning into ENSO-neutral conditions. The latest climate model forecasts indicate ENSO-neutral conditions are likely to establish during the beginning of the monsoon season and La Nina conditions, which result in good rains, are likely to develop during the later part of the monsoon season. IMD has announced that this year the southwest monsoon is likely to set in over Kerala on May 31. A good monsoon augurs well for the country’s agricultural sector which was hit by erratic weather last year. The monsoon plays a key role in the Indian economy as close to 50 per cent of the country's farmland does not have any other source of irrigation. The monsoon rains are also crucial for recharging the country’s reservoirs and aquifers from which the water can be used later in the year to irrigate crops. India has emerged as a key exporter of foodgrains but had to resort to curbing overseas shipments of sugar, rice, wheat and onions in order to increase domestic supplies and keep prices in check due to the erratic monsoon last year which hit farm production. The IMD defines average or normal rainfall as between 96 per cent and 104 per cent of a 50-year average of 87 cm (35 inches) for the June-Sept season.",

        "content": "India’s bowling duo Yuzvendra Chahal and Avesh Khan left to link up with the first batch of the Men in Blue squad in New York ahead of the ICC T20 World Cup starting from June 1 onwards. The World Cup-bound star spinner Chahal, who featured for Rajasthan Royals (RR) in the recently concluded IPL 2024, enjoyed an impressive campaign in which he bagged 18 wickets. Meanwhile, pacer Avesh Khan will be with India as a reserve player. At the Mumbai airport, pacer Avesh was seen talking to another reserve player Rinku Singh on video call. Earlier on Sunday, the first batch of Indian players including skipper Rohit Sharma, pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah and number-one-ranked T20I batter Suryakumar Yadav left for the United States. At the Mumbai airport, besides skipper Rohit, Bumrah and Suryakumar, head coach Rahul Dravid, batting coach Vikram Rathour, batter Shubman Gill, all-rounders Ravindra Jadeja and Shivam Dube, pacers Mohammed Siraj, Arshdeep Singh, Khaleel Ahmed, spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel were also captured at the airport. Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson who on Friday ended their Indian Premier League (IPL) campaign with Rajasthan Royals (RR) after a loss to Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) batter Rinku Singh and star batter Virat Kohli, whose team Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) lost to RR in the eliminator on Friday, have not joined the team yet. India will start their T20 World Cup campaign on June 5 against Ireland at the newly constructed Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York. Meanwhile, the most-awaited blockbuster clash between India and Pakistan will take place on June 9. They will later play tournament co-hosts USA (June 12) and Canada (June 15) to wrap up their Group A matches. In the tournament, India will be aiming to end their ICC trophy drought, having last won the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013. Since then, India has reached the 50-over World Cup final in 2023, semifinal in 2015 and 2019, the title clash of the ICC World Test Championship in 2021 and 2023, T20 WC final in 2014, semifinals in 2016 and 2022 but failed to secure a big ICC trophy. India will be aiming to win their first T20 WC title ever since they won the inaugural edition of the tournament back in 2007 in South Africa. In the last edition held in Australia in 2022, India lost to England by 10 wickets in the semifinals. India squad: Rohit Sharma (c), Hardik Pandya (vc), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant (wk), Sanju Samson (wk), Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohd. Siraj Reserves: Shubman Gill, Rinku Singh, Khaleel Ahmed and Avesh Khan. (ANI)",

        "content": "May 27, (THEWILL) – The Bayelsa State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal, in Abuja, has declared Douye Diri of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as duly elected Bayelsa State governor. A three-member panel of Justices, led by Adekunle Adeleye, upheld the victory of Diri in the November 11, 2023, gubernatorial election and dismissed as lacking in merit, the petition that was brought before it by the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate, Timipre Sylva. In its unanimous decision, the tribunal held that the petitioners failed to adduce any credible evidence to substantiate any of the allegations they raised against the outcome of the election. Consequently, the tribunal struck out as incompetent, all the additional proof of evidence, as well as statements on oath of some of the witnesses that testified for the petitioners. According to the tribunal, the law expressly provided that an election petition must be filed not later than 21 days after the result of an election was declared. It held that such a petition must be accompanied by written statements of all the intended witnesses at the time it was filed. The tribunal held that the decision of Sylva and his party to file their additional proof of evidence and statement on oath of witnesses, long after they had filed the petition, was “tantamount to a surreptitious attempt to amend the case of the petitioners.” The tribunal further dismissed the allegation that the deputy governor, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, tendered a forged University Degree Certificate and NYSC Exemption Certificate, to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in aid of his qualification to contest the election. It held that the allegation was a pre-election matter that ought to be litigated before the Federal High Court, adding that the matter had become statute-barred since the petitioners failed to challenge the genuineness of the certificates, 14 days after it was submitted to INEC. The tribunal held that a court of competent jurisdiction previously determined the issue of Ewhrudjakpo’s educational qualification. Holding that the petitioners were unable to discharge the burden of proof that was placed on them by the law, the three justices unanimously dismissed the petition and declared Duoye Diri of the PDP, the duly elected governor of Bayelsa.",

        "description": "NBA Hall of Fame center Bill Walton has died. He was 71 years old.",
        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. Video above: Remembering those we've lost in 2024 He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. \"Bill Walton,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, \"was truly one of a kind.\" Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. \"One of my guards said, 'Let's try something else,\" Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden's response during that timeout: \"Why? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. \"It's very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA's program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. \"As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It's hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.\"",

        "content": "GATINEAU — The Competition Bureau has launched the consultation process for Canadians as it prepares to launch a market study of competition in domestic air passenger services in Canada. “The airline industry is important to Canadians and the Canadian economy. Since the Canadian population is spread out over vast distances, other modes of transportation may not be feasible replacements for air travel. More competition in the industry will mean lower prices, better services, and improved productivity,” said Matthew Boswell, Commissioner of Competition. News of the bureau’s upcoming study first hit earlier this month. A statement from the Competition Bureau notes that recent events have raised questions about the state of competition in the industry ... The bureau says the market study will allow it to better understand what is driving these issues, and to make recommendations to all levels of government to improve competition in the airline industry. The study will examine how to make it easier for new businesses to compete and easier for consumers to make informed choices. For public feedback, interested parties can submit their comments by June 17 through a feedback form or by emailing airlinemarketstudy-etudemarcheaerien@cb-bc.gc.ca . Following the consultation, the bureau will publish its final terms of reference and officially launch the market study. The final terms of reference will include details on how to provide submissions to the market study.",

        "content": "Linda MacMullen has been battling with a rare autoimmune disease called myasthenia gravis (MG) for over two decades. This chronic disorder causes weakness in the skeletal muscles, which are responsible for a wide range of body movements and breathing. Myasthenia gravis can affect various facial muscles, altering a person’s ability to smile, chew, swallow, and control their eye movements. One of the most common symptoms experienced by people diagnosed with the disorder is becoming exhausted and feeling weaker following brief periods of physical activity or after performing everyday tasks. “Symptoms can be very mild where it just affects your eyes or it could be very severe where you end up in the hospital on a ventilator,” explained MacMullen. However, perhaps the most debilitating symptom of MG, according to MacMullen, is one that is not visible. “When you get diagnosed, the biggest thing is that you feel so alone,” said MacMullen. “When I was diagnosed, I’d never heard of my myasthenia and I was a nurse. (My) biggest (goal now) is breaking this isolation (and helping others.)” Though this disease has no cure to date, the prospect of a new drug called Vyvgart, approved by Health Canada in late 2023, gives hope to MacMullen. “One of my friends in Ontario is getting that treatment right now so we’re all waiting to see how well it works with her,” she said. “Anything that can give people a better quality of life and allow them to do the things that give them pleasure (I’m all for it.)” In the meantime, as June approaches, marking Myasthenia Gravis Awareness Month, MacMullen invites residents of the Comox Valley and beyond to a walk she organizes annually. “(I’m doing this walk) mainly to raise awareness (and) funds,” said MacMullen. “The more awareness we create, the more people know about it. Right now, my whole focus is on improving (people’s) quality of life.” MacMullen explained that any donations can go a long way. “(With more funding we) would offer more support to patients and caregivers dealing with myasthenia gravis. It would also allow me to organize more events like online support groups where we have guest speakers and get more information about new upcoming treatments.” This year’s event will be held at Courtenay’s Woodcote Park and is scheduled for June 23, starting at 10 a.m. Hot dogs and water will be offered at the end of the walk. Donations are appreciated and can be made on-site. To learn more about myasthenia gravis, visit",

        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that a deadly strike that hit a displacement camp in Gaza's Rafah was a \"tragic accident\" which his government was investigating. \"In Rafah, we evacuated a million uninvolved residents and, despite our best efforts, a tragic accident happened yesterday,\" Netanyahu told parliament. He added that \"we are investigating the case and will draw the conclusions\" after Gaza's health ministry reported 45 dead as the strike late Sunday sparked a fire that tore through a tent city for displaced Gazans. The ministry in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip also said that 249 people were wounded. Israel faced a wave of international condemnation on Monday over the Rafah strike, including from across the region as well from the European Union, France and the United Nations. The Israeli military said it had launched a probe into the strike which it said was carried out based on \"precise intelligence information\" about two Hamas militants who it said were killed. It also said \"the strike did not occur in the humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi, to which the IDF (army) has encouraged civilians to evacuate\" since the ground operation began in Rafah. Netanyahu struck a defiant tone in his Knesset address while being heckled by relatives of hostages held in Gaza, and vowed to keep up the battle to destroy Hamas. \"There is no substitute for absolute victory\" in Gaza, he told the chamber. Netanyahu denounced pressure, both internal and external, that he said his government has faced since the war in Gaza began. \"They pressured us then,\" said Netanyahu, before listing calls to refrain from military operations which Israel carried out anyway. \"Don't enter Gaza. We entered! Do not enter Shifa! We entered! Do not enter Khan Yunis! We entered! Do not enter Rafah! We entered!\" he said. \"I don't give up and I won't give up! I stand up to pressures from home and abroad.",

        "content": "The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) reported a smooth start to the casting of special votes on Monday, despite some glitches resulting in voting stations opening late in parts of the country. The first official day of voting inside the country was marred by isolated protests - in the Eastern Cape and parts of Gauteng - and there were reports of voting stations failing to open, but the IEC indicated that only 0.1% of those casting their votes experienced problems doing so. The IEC's deputy chief electoral commissioner, Masego Sheburi, said that, from 14:00 on Monday, around 201 794 people visited voting stations to cast special votes across the country. A total of 1 668 076 people had applied for special votes. Of these, 624 593 citizens will be visited by 62 000 officials over the next two days. \"Reports of difficulties were insignificant... about 0.1% reported challenges compared to those [stations] that opened and were run smoothly,\" he said. READ | Special votes day 1: Slow queues, a sense of obligation, and a lamp post Rickroll He said a record number of voters had applied for special votes this time around, with more than 1.6 million voters applying for special votes this year compared to the 774 000 who applied in 2019. \"The Electoral Commission is happy with the turnout and urges South Africans to continue to go out in their numbers to vote on 29 May 2024. \"Owing to the good preparations, the commission was able to open the majority of voting stations in the Eastern Cape, in the face of protests which had nothing to do with elections.\" He told journalists that 107 of the 435 voting stations meant to open remained closed due to \"external factors\". The IEC is pushing to ensure that all voting stations open on Tuesday. Some voting stations failed to open due to a lack of stationary - ballot papers and envelopes. Special votes are cast using a two-envelope system. The voter places their ballots into an envelope in the ballot box, which is then inserted into a second envelope, with the name and identity number of the individual, before being placed in the ballot box. This ensures that all votes cast are accounted for when they are counted. Special votes are counted along with the bulk votes, which are cast on 29 May. Special votes continue on Tuesday, ahead of the election day for the rest of the country on Wednesday, with polls opening at 07:00.",

        "description": "The sensitive updates to this Victorian home have refreshed its look without compromising on heritage charm",
        "content": "The renovation of this family home in Brookline, MA, was all about finding the right balance. The 1905-built Victorian home already had plenty of period charm – all part of the original – but its new owners wanted to add in a few key user-friendly details that you'd be more likely to find in a newly built home. How to update a heritage property without sacrificing its character and meaningful details: that was the challenge for this renovation. To ensure they came up with the right solution the owners enlisted the help of . 'This project spoke to our design hearts with the encouragement to create a masterful blend and bring something fresh to the table,' says principal Vani Sayeed, who describes how she gave the historic home a new lease of life, all the while being mindful of its unique character. 'The goal was to first update the interior architecture by moving a few walls, restoring some of the original architectural details and adding important design elements to elevate and make all spaces not only functional but beautiful and inviting,' says designer Vani Sayeed. 'The client wanted an updated space that had the charm and architectural details of a bygone era but with all the bells and whistles and comforts of a modern home.' The renovation kept the basic layout of a classic Victorian home as the homeowner was drawn to more private areas to entertain, such as a formal dining room, separate kitchen and this cozy parlor . The Roman shades fabric is Sacho Clouds from TM Interiors, with a coffee table from Restoration Hardware, and wall sconces from Urban Electric. The artworks are from the owners' existing Collection, with some from Vani Sayeed. 'This project was a collaboration between client and designer based on a mutual love of classic New England architecture, the ethereal beauty of the California coastline and the grand Rocky Mountains of Colorado,' explains Vani Sayeed. 'With this in mind as the inspiration we aspired to create spaces that reflected the calming rejuvenating quality found in nature.' This comfortable space includes a custom rug from Vani Sayeed's Global Chic Collection, with the designer selecting the perfect for the living room. Vani Sayeed Studios is an award-winning multi-discipline design firm. Vani Sayeed is the firm’s principal; well known for her globally inspired and beautifully layered spaces. She was awarded Interior Designer of the Year 2023 by IFDA, New England. Her inspiration comes from a worldly well-travelled and creative perspective. She is informed by a diverse sensibility of design, art and architecture. The ethos of the studio is to honor classical traditions, while embracing novelty and innovation. While the furnishings and furniture are contemporary, the bones of the house clearly reference the property's Victorian origins. Details such as the striking bay windows and smart architectural moldings truly ground the home and ensure it keeps its character, even though it has been updated to make for a more comfortable family life. Tucked into an original alcove, this stylish enhances and makes good use of the Victorian architecture. 'The kitchen was completely gutted down to studs and redesigned to create a larger footprint, along with new windows, cabinets and state-of-the-art appliances,' says Vani. are light and bright with white cabinetry and a dark blue custom-built island providing a good contrast with the white units. The cabinets are from Signature, the countertops are white quartzite in a leather finish and the island is in the dramatic quartzite explosion blue leathered 2.5” mitered edge were at the heart of Vani's redesigned kitchen, with the trio of contemporary pendant lights above the counter becoming a new focal point. Coming up with the right for the redesigned kitchen took some thinking. Vani knew there should be a second element of contrast with the white cabinetry, besides the dark marble-topped island, and the custom stainless steel hood in a more traditional style proved to be the perfect choice, inspired by a Henry Moore sculpture, says Vani. 'These old houses are full of surprises,' says Vani, 'but the one thing that actually turned into a major plus is the breakfast nook in the kitchen. It was carved out of a found space during our demolition of the old kitchen. Instead of boarding it back up, we realigned some of the structure and utilized this valuable real estate by incorporating it into a spot for breakfast with hidden LED lighting.' Anyone looking for will surely be inspired by this treatment. 'We covered the niche in a cool blue crocodile pattern wall covering from Elitis, adding stainless steel open shelves and gorgeous oak details,' adds Vani. Although the owner was keen to embrace separate and formal , this space sits at the heart of the home, with enlarged doorways through to the kitchen and foyer. The central position adds to the impression that you are in an intimate, cozy space – the perfect setting for good mealtime conversations. 'We love this dining room with walls covered in Elitis Luminescent Isis. The gold hammered effect of the wall covering makes your skin glow!' says designer Vani. Furniture includes a custom-designed dining table with a steel base and mahogany top, flanked by chairs from Dowel Furniture. The jewel pieces are the host and hostess chairs by Jamie Stern in two different fabrics. The backs are a bold Schumacher Tabriz, the inside fabric is Perennials' Classy design. The area rug is the Summer Day Walk, from Vani Sayeed's Global Chic Collection, the chandelier is from Urban Electric. Making a big impact as you walk in the front door is the imposing but welcoming . 'The two-level foyer has beautiful architectural woodwork that has been restored to its original beauty. The lighting is Urban Electric, the fireplace has been updated with a gas insert and beautiful Fossil Black Quartzite surround,' says Vani. took shape around a dramatic wool runner from Merida Rugs, which provides a great foundation to the bold art on the wall. On the hallway's lower level, this corner creates an appealing display moment with a dark wood table and bench grounding a fine landscape painting and a collection of treasured ceramics. Having the luxury of space and quirky alcoves to create interesting displays like this is something that older character homes do well. The window treatments in this calm are made in Clodagh, a simple fabric from Perennials, the bed is Room & Board flanked on either side by wall sconces from Estiluz, with a beautiful nude painting from the owner's collection. The primary bathroom is spacious with a shower and separate soaking tub. include shower walls covered in a green marble mosaic and the floor is a 12“x24“ faux marble porcelain tile from Porcelanosa. The roll-top bath and dark wood vanity reference the home's original 19th-century style. bring a playful twist to the guest facilities. The quirky Buggie Atomic 29 wallcovering by Abnormals Anonymous lends a fun element to the walls, with custom-made copper plumbing adding the luxurious finishing touches. It's the thoughtful details in this historic home's redesign that so successfully bridge the gap between period charm and modern-day comforts. New items are designed to blend with original features, bringing a fresh perspective and new life to this old home. Interior design: Photography:",

        "content": "RAFA NADAL was given a hero’s send-off in Paris as he waved goodbye to the French Open for possibly the final time. Grand Slam champions Novak Djokovic , Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek were present on Court Philippe-Chatrier to witness the abdication of the King of Clay. This was the hottest ticket in town as Nadal – winner of a record 14 French Opens since 2005 – bid farewell to the place where he is adored the most. Alex Zverev , the No 4 seed, was simply too strong and wily and ended up succeeding in straight sets 6-3 7-6 6-3 over more than three hours. Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, went down on his shield like a true warrior and did not disgrace himself – he was just beaten by the better man on his special occasion. At times, we did see glimpses of the racquet-wielding matador at his best. But it was too infrequent to knock out the German, who prevailed two years after their last encounter in the semi-finals when he tore ankle ligaments in a horror fall. For what we assume is the last time on these grounds, Nadal shook hands with his opponent at the net and then the umpire before putting away his racquets and zipping up his bag. The noise was deafening when he arrived on court holding the hand of a ball kid under a closed roof due to the rain. And it was equally as ear-splitting when he departed, the climax to a record-breaking two-decade spell on Parisian clay. CASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS Technically this is not his final appearance on this red surface as he wants to return for the Paris Olympics in late July and early August with the intention of playing at least men’s doubles with Alcaraz. However, Nadal is unlikely to play at Wimbledon because the quick transition of clay-grass-clay might ruin his chances of a third Olympic medal in the French capital. But he even teased he might return for the 2025 French Open, saying that he would not commit 100% to this being his swansong event. He said: \"I don’t know if it is the last time I am here in front of you, honestly. \"I’m not 100%. If it is the last time, I enjoyed it. The crowd have been amazing during the whole two weeks of preparation.\" There was no specially-arranged farewell presentation for the 22-time major winner on his request. Yet the sight of so many active stars, including his biggest rivals, in the stands was, in a way, its own tribute. The whole Nadal clan were in attendance, too, with a debut appearance for son Rafael Jr, who was born in October 2022. The travelling party also included grey-haired uncle Miguel, 57, whose penalty for Spain was saved by England goalkeeper David Seaman in the quarter-final shootout of Euro 96 at Wembley. Manchester City star Rodri, fresh from the FA Cup final defeat , had managed to nab a ticket to watch his fellow compatriot and joined in with the morale-boosting chants of Rafa. This was Nadal’s fourth defeat in 116 matches here and the first time he has exited from the first round as he sent a forehand wide and long. His Roland Garros record is one of the most astonishing ever witnessed in professional sport and it is unlikely his dominance will be replicated. There is already a statue of him in full flow next to the main arena and it will act as a reminder for future generations just how exceptional he was on this surface. Nadal continued: \"Today the feeling I have is difficult to describe in words. \"For me, it’s special to feel the love of the people in the place I love the most. \"I have been going through a tough two years in terms of injuries. I went through all this process with the dream to be here at Roland Garros. \"The first round hasn’t been the ideal one. I have to say I needed something else, I was competitive, I had my chances but it was not enough against a great player. \"It’s difficult to say what happens in the future. It’s a big percentage that I will not be back here. I cannot say 100%. I am having fun, the body is feeling better than two months ago. \"Maybe in two months I say, it’s enough. I cannot give anything else. I don’t feel it yet. \"I have goals in front of me. I hope to be back for the Olympics. That motivates me. I hope to be well prepared. \"It has been a very beautiful process, all the memories, every single year were different, but not less special. Unforgettable feelings. I hope to see you again but I don’t know.\"",

Yet the sight of so many active stars, including his biggest rivals, in the stands was, in a way, its own tribute. The whole Nadal clan were in attendance, too, with a debut appearance for son Rafael Jr, who was born in October 2022. The travelling party also included grey-haired uncle Miguel, 57, whose penalty for Spain was saved by England goalkeeper David Seaman in the quarter-final shootout of Euro 96 at Wembley. Manchester City star Rodri, fresh from the FA Cup final defeat , had managed to nab a ticket to watch his fellow compatriot and joined in with the morale-boosting chants of Rafa. This was Nadal’s fourth defeat in 116 matches here and the first time he has exited from the first round as he sent a forehand wide and long. His Roland Garros record is one of the most astonishing ever witnessed in professional sport and it is unlikely his dominance will be replicated. There is already a statue of him in full flow next to the main arena and it will act as a reminder for future generations just how exceptional he was on this surface. Nadal continued: \"Today the feeling I have is difficult to describe in words. \"For me, it’s special to feel the love of the people in the place I love the most. \"I have been going through a tough two years in terms of injuries. I went through all this process with the dream to be here at Roland Garros. \"The first round hasn’t been the ideal one. I have to say I needed something else, I was competitive, I had my chances but it was not enough against a great player. \"It’s difficult to say what happens in the future. It’s a big percentage that I will not be back here. I cannot say 100%. I am having fun, the body is feeling better than two months ago. \"Maybe in two months I say, it’s enough. I cannot give anything else. I don’t feel it yet. \"I have goals in front of me. I hope to be back for the Olympics. That motivates me. I hope to be well prepared. \"It has been a very beautiful process, all the memories, every single year were different, but not less special. Unforgettable feelings. I hope to see you again but I don’t know.\"",

David Zalubowski via Associated Press Bill Walton, an NBA Hall of Fame center who got his start at UCLA before winning NBA championships with the Portland Trail Blazers and the Boston Celtics, has died. Walton, 71, passed away after “a prolonged battle with cancer,” the NBA said in a statement Monday. “Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. “As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans.” Advertisement “But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver went on. “He was a regular presence at league events ― always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” “As a cherished member of the NBA family for 50 years, Bill will be deeply missed by all those who came to know and love him,” Silver said. “My heartfelt condolences to Bill’s wife, Lori; his sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris; and his many friends and colleagues.” This is a developing story.

        "description": "As we bid farewell to Ambassador Raveesh Kumar, the esteemed Indian representative in Finland, we reflect on his impactful tenure that began amidst the challenging backdrop of the global pandemic. Ambassador Kumar has been known for his active engagement during his time here, working to strengthen the bond between India and Finland. In this interview, we have the privilege of gaining insights from Ambassador Kumar as he shares his experiences, achievements, and perspectives garnered during his engaging four-year term in Finland.",
        "content": "You arrived in Finland just as the pandemic began. How was it to commence your mission during such challenging times? I arrived in Finland with my family in July 2020, in the middle of Covid pandemic. There were restrictions on movement, on meeting people. It felt like we were constantly navigating uncharted territory. Everything from remote work setups to health protocols kept changing, and it was a challenge to keep up. It was a test of adaptability and resilience like never before. I was fortunate to present my credentials to then President Niinistö and continued with our outreach initiatives. Even though it was a tough period, I think we all came out of it stronger in some way. It’s all behind us now, thankfully. You've been one of the most active ambassadors in Finland. Could you summarize your tenure here? Were you able to achieve your envisioned goals? As diplomats, we all are expected to do some groundwork before proceeding on our assignment. But then, implementation depends on the ground realities. And here, I was quite fortunate to be around when our relations are looking up and have acquired a certain momentum. The backdrop of the evolving geopolitical order played its part too. We have Finland as a member of NATO, part of Nordic-BALTIC framework and an influential voice in the EU. India is an important voice for the global south, the 5th largest and fastest growing economy and a country shaping the global narrative. We have a far larger global footprint and are members of several multilateral organisations like I2U2, BRICS, SCO, and recently launched India-Middle East-Europe initiative, Global Biofuel Alliance, ISA, etc. So, despite our own preoccupations, it goes to the credit of both countries that our relations have acquired substance and character. I had twin broad objectives in mind when I arrived here – present the new India with a rising geopolitical profile as a land of opportunities; and leverage the dynamism of the Indian community in Finland for strengthening our bilateral ties. The launch of DESI (Digitalisation, Education, Sustainability and Innovation) initiative, first-in person meeting between Prime Ministers, frequent Ministerial exchanges, opening of a new Finnish Consulate in Mumbai, record high trade figure of € 3 bn, growing investment by both sides, record participation at SLUSH and discussion on facilitating mobility are the highlights. We are working on creating a framework to cooperate in Quantum and in Sustainability. They all demonstrate the keen desire of both countries to engage in a concrete manner with each other in areas which are of interest and relevance to both countries as we celebrate 75 years of our diplomatic relations. On the Indian community, I am proud to represent a widely respected vibrant community. We managed to bring them together on a number of platforms like Friends of India and Finland (a platform representing 16 Indian community associations), India Business and Professionals Forum, connecting top Indian professionals and entrepreneurs and Finland India Network of Researchers and Academics. India Day, a festival celebrating friendship between both countries, is a proud product of the vibrant Indian community. You introduced the Open Doors initiative, allowing any Indian citizen to visit you twice a month without an appointment. How successful was this initiative, and what insights did you gain into the Indian community in Finland? The idea of Open House was to be accessible and transparent to the people. And to connect to the people who otherwise are outside the footprint of the Embassy. I managed to meet so many interesting people and learn from their own cumulative experiences in Finland. With the rapid growth of the Indian community in Finland, particularly in skilled IT sectors, how has this impacted the embassy's operations? Are there concerns about brain drain from India? The Indian community has emerged as a strong bridge connecting India and Finland. They are a well-placed and well-respected community in Finland. A community which contributes economically and socially to Finland. They are among the highest tax payers and well-integrated into the fabric of the Finnish society. We are leveraging their presence for a stronger bilateral connection between both countries. Were there any significant cultural adjustments or \"culture shocks\" you experienced during your four years in Finland? Well...’culture shock’ is too strong a word. Moving to Finland definitely involved some adjustments, especially related to weather, as with any international move. I found some aspects of Finnish culture different from what I was used to. I mean, where else can you enjoy sitting in a sauna at 90 degrees Celsius, and then jump into an ice-cold lake for fun? But once you absorb it with an open mind, it is not only a memorable experience, but also gives insights into the rich Finnish culture and tradition. As you prepare to lead the Indian mission in Prague and your successor takes over in Helsinki, what advice have you given regarding Finland, and what insights has your colleague offered about the Czech Republic? Well, I am in regular touch with my colleague and friend, Hemant, who is succeeding me as Ambassador and I take his place in Prague. We are discussing the upcoming agenda for both of us, as well as exchanging notes on the lighter side of things. On a lighter note, I am going to advise him to get a dog, to his your social circle in the neighbourhood! If you could provide feedback to the Finnish Minister of Foreign Affairs and your counterparts here, what would it entail? I had an excellent working relationship with the Foreign Ministry and other Ministries in Finland. I was quite delighted that there was the same level of enthusiasm to expand our partnership. I would say that we need to work together to elevate the relationship into a different orbit. Could you discuss the impact of your tenure on fostering collaborations, promoting cultural exchange, facilitating trade and investment, and engaging with the Indian diaspora in Finland? It may not be appropriate for me to judge my own tenure. It is for others to assess. I can, however, say that I was fortunate to be in Finland when there is plenty of goodwill on both sides. I strived to play my part in encouraging collaborations, promoting cultural exchange and facilitating trade and investment. Additionally, engaging with the Indian diaspora in Finland has been a rewarding experience, as we have worked together to build a supportive and vibrant community that strengthens the ties between our countries. While there is always more work to be done, I am satisfied with the strides we have made so far. Could you share any memorable experiences or anecdotes from your time as ambassador in Finland? There are many that come to my mind. My recent meeting with President Stubb and former Prime Minister Sanna Marin. My trips to 14 towns outside Helsinki, Yoga at midnight at Oonasvara in Rovaniemi, being among the many thousands at Savonlinna Opera Festival and the sheer thrill and energy of Jyvaskyla car rally. I would also highlight the whole experience of organising India Day 2023 with a dedicated and selfless team of volunteers. The warmth and enthusiasm of the community, combined with the participation of our Finnish friends, truly highlighted the beautiful blend of our cultures. India Day 2024 on 18 August at Meripuisto celebrating 75 years of diplomatic relations between India and Finland promises to be one big celebration. Alexis Kouros Helsinki Times",

        "description": "If you've heard about the \"pro touring\" and \"restomod\" car-building styles, you might be wondering how they're different. Let's take a look.",
        "content": "Classic cars have an aura all of their own, with lines like the 1969 Ford Mustang having a signature style that sets them apart from even their sportiest, edgiest modern-day descendants. But while owning a classic big-block muscle car may seem like a great idea on paper, the reality may not be quite so rosy. Sure, it'll go fast in a straight line, but if you're used to modern cars you may find other aspects of the authentic vintage experience — overly-soft suspensions and sub-par braking systems, to name a couple — hard to live with. That's where restomods and pro-touring restorations come into the picture. Both approaches aim to retain the old-school aesthetic appeal of a vintage car while bringing the driving experience up to the 21st century with modern upgrades and tweaks. They're not for purists who want that \"blast from the past\" feel of a vintage car, warts and all, but they're a great way to immerse yourself in the vibe of the '60s or '70s without all of the sacrifices of the original model. If you want a modern experience with classic looks, then a restomod or pro-touring car is the way to go. But what do these terms mean, exactly, and how do you differentiate and choose between the two? Let's dive in. The term \"restomod\" is a portmanteau of \"restoration\" and \"modified,\" which explains the whole concept of a restomod remarkably well. They prioritize the restoration aspect, keeping a car close — or identical — to factory spec aesthetically while modifying it to improve the overall driving experience. However, restomods generally don't go too extreme with the modifications, retaining many of the qualities of the original car while bringing it up to modern-day standards. How much work gets put into a restomod will vary depending on the original car and what the builder's goals are. However, most restomods tend to feature updated handling and safety features — modern brakes, power steering, updated suspension — and creature comforts like new interiors and infotainment systems. New powertrains are also quite common, especially the (in)famous LS swap — one of the most popular engine swaps for a classic car using General Motors' LS V8. Another common modification is new wheels and tires, with larger diameter and width almost always the order of the day. The end goal of a restomod is to make a classic car more livable on a daily basis, bringing the reliability and drivability up to standards one would expect from a new, showroom-fresh car. It's a step beyond a traditional restoration, but isn't quite as extreme as a pro-touring car and its track-centric focus. Take a look at Singer's 911 restomods, such as the Octagon Commission , which has a traditional exterior married with a luxuriously updated interior and tuned engine. Pro touring cars are a step beyond conventional restomods. While they start from the same principles of modernizing and updating a classic car, builders of pro-touring models — especially muscle cars — often have the express goal of outpacing a modern, high-performance counterpart in a straight line and around corners. As the \"pro\" in the name might suggest, pro-touring cars are generally competition-focused — they emphasize autocross and road circuit performance, albeit without entirely compromising on daily driver comforts. This can involve a lot more work than a restomod as it requires modifications to most, if not all, aspects of the car to bring it up to a whole new level. Pro-touring cars can have all-new suspension setups with much lower ride heights and stiffer springs for better handling, paired with bigger wheels and sticky, high-performance tires. Engine and transmission upgrades are also par for the course, with some builds going so far as to use an entirely new chassis to take all that extra power and improve handling. Pro-touring cars can also feature modified bodies with new aerodynamics to further tweak the car's handling behavior — such as improving downforce for road courses. The term \"pro touring\" dates back to the early 1990s and a modified 1969 Camaro that competed in the 1993 One Lap of America. The Camaro, known as \"Tri-Tip,\" rocked a 400-cubic-inch small-block engine, Corvette ZR1 brakes, new 17-inch wheels, and weight-reducing parts such as a fiberglass hood. It set the template for — and kicked off — the whole pro-touring movement. [Image by Michel Curi via Wikimedia Commons | Cropped and scaled | CC BY 2.0 ] Both approaches focus on improving a classic car and go beyond simply restoring it to its old glory. In that regard, the two approaches are more similar than they are different. In fact, there is an argument to be made that \"restomod\" is a blanket term that covers pro touring as well. After all, both involve restoring a car before modifying it to suit whatever standards the owner wants — whether it's simply a classic car that can keep up with traffic and handle decently, or a track-focused monster capable of eating up Lamborghinis for lunch. Restomod and pro-touring builders also modify similar parts of a car, just to differing degrees. Modified suspensions? Check. Improved brakes and steering? Present on restomods and pro-touring cars. Even modified (or entirely new) engines and transmissions aren't solely the domain of pro-touring models, with restomods often opting for upgraded powertrains. Witness the Volvo P1800 Cyan GT Restomod and its 2-liter, 300-400 horsepower engine, which is a far cry from the 100 horsepower its stock 1.8-liter engine produces. If you boil the two terms down, they're more similar than they are different. But, as with so many things, it's the finer details that can help us separate the two. Pro-touring and restomod cars may have a similar basic philosophy, but the two differ greatly in their end results. Restomods are often more faithful to the base model — their mods are meant to modernize without losing the spirit of the original. For instance, Singer's Dynamics and Lightweighting Study 911 makes many changes to the original, with a stiffer body and various tweaks to the powertrain and transmission. Despite these tweaks, the restomod retains the original's handling characteristics. Notably, Top Gear tested the vehicle and found that the 911 had all the over- and understeer traits of the original, just in a more manageable form. It's still recognizably a Porsche 911 from the early 1990s generation , but with power and grip levels elevated closer to that of a modern performance car. Contrast that to a pro-touring build like Chris Smith's 1970 Camaro , which is an almost all-new car underneath the classic Chevrolet Camaro styling . Starting as an empty shell, Smith bolted on all-new front and rear suspension systems courtesy of Speedtech Performance, with Wilwood brakes all around. A 720-horsepower 427 LS7 engine sits underneath the hood, mated to a new sequential transmission. There's also a huge spoiler on the back, plus carbon fiber panels aplenty. The end result is a Camaro capable of navigating a small autocross circuit in a way that an original could only dream of. If you're in the market for a modernized classic, the decision between a restomod and pro-touring build primarily comes down to what you want out of your car. If you're interested in a daily driver and want your car to retain an old-school feel without the old-school headaches, then a more conservative restomod is likely the way to go. On the other hand, if you're after pure performance and competitive racing, a pro-touring build might just be what the doctor ordered. It's really just a matter of degrees, and how extreme of a car you want. Price comes into the picture, too, but the blurred line between pro-touring and restomods means it's hard to make a definitive statement about which of the two styles will be cheaper to build. Pro-touring cars can definitely cost a lot, and six-figure investments are not unheard-of — and probably quite common. But while restomods can be much cheaper, there are always exceptions. Some enthusiasts have put well over $100,000 into their restomods before selling them off for much less than what it cost them to build. That final point is perhaps a saving grace: If you're happy buying instead of building, you can often buy restomods and pro-tourer cars for surprisingly affordable prices — at least, compared to what the builders spent. We've seen pro-touring cars boasting $100,000 worth of parts selling for less than $80,000. That's really a steal, provided you can live with someone else's parts choices.",

        "content": "Karan Kandhari ‘s “ Sister Midnight ” is a surreal Mumbai fable with an aggressive comedic rhythm. It’s composed by hitting the same few notes ad nauseam, but hitting them exceptionally well and for much longer than one might expect before it eventually runs out of steam. All the while, Kandhari takes a novel visual approach to the topic of arranged marriage, situating his woebegone couple — his protagonist in particular, a woman who feels trapped — in a realm of strange psychosis. It’s better than it has any right to be, but not nearly as good as it should be. Uma (Radhika Apte) is brash, acerbic and vulgar. Unable to cook or manage household expenses, she fulfills very few of the rigid expectations of a new Indian bride. When she arrives at her cramped new one-room apartment with her soft-spoken husband Gopal (Ashok Pathak) — an ostensible stranger — on their wedding night, the awkwardness between them is palpable. She wants to (or perhaps, believes it’s her duty to) sleep with him, but he can barely take his shirt off in front of her. It doesn’t take long for Kandhari to establish his snappy comedic vibe, with all the calculated framing, editing and choreography of a Wes Anderson action scene (the wake in “The Grand Budapest Hotel” comes to mind, with its litany of well-timed punches). However, first-time feature director Kandhari also marches to the beat of his own drum, constrained by neither tone nor genre expectation. His music choices range from Bengali folk to American punk and blues. While of Indian origin, Kandhari is London-based and draws from a variety of cultural influences, but his depiction of working class Mumbai never feels inauthentic, especially in the movie’s quieter, low-lit moments, whose shadowy visual contrast creates striking portraits of Uma that verge on expressionistic. While Gopal is at work, Uma tries to settle into a domestic routine, which involves everything from learning to chop vegetables to figuring out how to spend her free time in her crowded neighborhood, whose bustling noise prevents her from sleeping in. The happily married woman next door, Sheetal (played by Chhaya Kadam, who also stars in Cannes Grand Prix winner “All We Imagine As Light”) takes Uma under her wing and delivers even her most impassioned and welcoming lines with wry, impenetrable wit. It’s a role Kadam nails completely, finding variance even within comedic monotony, and she makes for an amusing contrast with Apte’s more fiery and unpredictable performance. Between Uma’s gossiping neighbors and the pressures of social expectation, her psyche begins to rip apart at the seams, until eventually she finds a particularly macabre outlet for her frustrations. When her anxieties begin to manifest in the world around her, Kandhari makes tremendously inventive use of stop-motion elements. They cause a kind of fissure in his world-building, revealing seamlessly blended images that don’t quite make logical sense or — like Uma herself — feel like they belong. However, the more sudden genre swerves “Sister Midnight” takes, the more Kandhari cedes control to an imagined version of his film that does not (and perhaps cannot) exist. His story holds Indian patriarchal norms to account and via its sensitive, anxious depiction of Gopal, makes him as much a victim of circumstance as Uma, if not more so. The exact subgenres from which “Sister Midnight” ultimately takes its cues are better left unspoiled, but several of its genre hallmarks harken back to films about the all-consuming nature of romance. However, the misfortunes that eventually befall Gopal, courtesy of Uma’s crumbling state of mind, lead to incongruous outcomes that feel too irreverently nasty. Kandhari has a clear and perverse vision, but he’s also incredibly successful (perhaps to a fault) at eliciting sympathy for his characters. The bleak, punk-feminist parable he tries to build, using phantasmagorical imagery, strays too far toward the realm of disturbing — both emotionally and viscerally — to fully connect and keep viewers on its wavelength. This dissonance also collides with (and perhaps contributes to) the movie’s clockwork rhythm becoming too mechanical to manage. Beyond a point, its visual comedy no longer remains unpredictable, and everything that initially works about its unique sensibilities becomes a burden, preventing “Sister Midnight” from undergoing the metamorphosis necessary to chase its initial surrealist high. The story soon gets away from Kandhari, leading to a film that enraptures and delights in its first hour but gets so locked in to a singular approach by its second that it’s practically consumed by its own style, rendering it unable to keep pace with the bold ideas at play.",

        "content": "OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. — Generations of American families have grown up not knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones who died while serving their country in World War II and other conflicts. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency forensic anthropologist Carrie Brown looks at objects in a lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. But a federal lab tucked away above the bowling alley at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha and a sister lab in Hawaii are steadily answering those lingering questions, aiming to offer 200 families per year the chance to honor their relatives with a proper burial. “They may not even have been alive when that service member was alive, but that story gets carried down through the generations,\" said Carrie Brown, a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab manager at Offutt. \"They may have seen on the mantle a picture of that person when they were little and not really understood or known who they were.” Memorial Day and the upcoming 80th anniversary of D-Day on June 6 are reminders of the urgency of Brown's work. The forensic anthropologists, medical examiners and historians who work together to identify lost soldiers are in a race against time as remains buried on battlefields around the globe deteriorate. But advances in DNA technology, combined with innovative techniques including comparing bones to chest X-rays taken by the military, mean the labs can identify more of the missing soldiers every year. Some 72,000 World War II soldiers remain unaccounted for, along with roughly 10,000 more from all the conflicts since. The experts believe about half of those are recoverable. The agency identified 59 servicemembers in 2013, when the Offutt lab first opened. That number has steadily risen — 159 service members last year, up from 134 in 2022 — and the labs have a goal of 200 identifications annually. Donna Kennedy holds a photo of her cousin Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, who was buried with full military honors, May 20 in Lawson, Mo. The labs' work allowed Donna Kennedy to bury her cousin, Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, with full military honors this month in the same Lawson, Missouri, cemetery where his father and grandfather are buried. Patten died 74 years ago during the Korean War, but spent decades buried as an unknown in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii. “I just, I ached. I mean, it hurt. You know, I just felt so bad. Even though I didn’t know him, I loved him,” Kennedy said. Patten's funeral was a simple affair with just a few family members. But often when veterans who fought decades earlier are identified, people waving flags and holding signs line the streets of their hometowns to herald the return of their remains. “This work is important first and foremost because these are individuals that gave their lives to protect our freedom, and they paid the ultimate sacrifice. So we’re here holding that promise that we’ll return them home to their families,” Brown said. Photos of service members are seen on a wall in a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. \"It’s important for their families to show them that we’ll never stop, no matter what,” she said. Often there are compelling details, Brown said. One of her first cases involved the intact remains of a World War I Marine found in a forest in France with his wallet still in his pocket. The wallet, initialed G.H., contained a New York Times article describing plans for the offensive in which he ultimately died. He also had an infantryman badge with his name and the year he received it on the back. Before leaving France with the remains, the team visited a local cemetery where other soldiers were buried and learned there were only two missing soldiers with the initials G.H. Brown had a fair idea who that soldier was before his remains even arrived in the lab. That veteran was buried in Arlington National Cemetery and Brown often visits his grave when she is in Washington D.C. Most cases aren’t that easy. A worker looks at objects in a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. The experts who work at the lab must piece together identities by looking at historical records about where the remains were found and which soldiers were in the area. They then consult the list of possible names and use the bones, objects found with them, military medical records and DNA to confirm their identities. They focus on battles and plane crashes where they have the greatest chance of success because of available information. But their work can be complicated if soldiers were buried in a temporary cemetery and moved when a unit was forced to retreat. And unidentified soldiers were often buried together. When remains are brought to the lab, they sometimes include an extra bone. Experts then spend months or even years matching the bones and waiting for DNA and other test results to confirm their identities. One test even can identify if the soldier grew up primarily eating rice or a corn-based diet. The lab also compares specific traits of collar bones to the chest X-rays the military routinely took of soldiers before they were deployed. It helps that the military keeps extensive records of all soldiers. Those clues help the experts put together the puzzle of someone's identity. “It’s not always easy. It’s certainly not instantaneous,” Brown said. “Some of the cases, we really have to fight to get to that spot, because some of them have been gone for 80 years.” A man looks at a damaged car after a tornado hit the day before, Sunday, May 26, 2024, in Valley View, Texas.

        "content": "OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. — Generations of American families have grown up not knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones who died while serving their country in World War II and other conflicts. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency forensic anthropologist Carrie Brown looks at objects in a lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. Charlie Neibergall, Associated Press But a federal lab tucked away above the bowling alley at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha and a sister lab in Hawaii are steadily answering those lingering questions, aiming to offer 200 families per year the chance to honor their relatives with a proper burial. “They may not even have been alive when that service member was alive, but that story gets carried down through the generations,\" said Carrie Brown, a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab manager at Offutt. \"They may have seen on the mantle a picture of that person when they were little and not really understood or known who they were.” Memorial Day and the upcoming 80th anniversary of D-Day on June 6 are reminders of the urgency of Brown's work. The forensic anthropologists, medical examiners and historians who work together to identify lost soldiers are in a race against time as remains buried on battlefields around the globe deteriorate. But advances in DNA technology, combined with innovative techniques including comparing bones to chest X-rays taken by the military, mean the labs can identify more of the missing soldiers every year. Some 72,000 World War II soldiers remain unaccounted for, along with roughly 10,000 more from all the conflicts since. The experts believe about half of those are recoverable. The agency identified 59 servicemembers in 2013, when the Offutt lab first opened. That number has steadily risen — 159 service members last year, up from 134 in 2022 — and the labs have a goal of 200 identifications annually. Donna Kennedy holds a photo of her cousin Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, who was buried with full military honors, May 20 in Lawson, Mo. Nick Ingram, Associated Press The labs' work allowed Donna Kennedy to bury her cousin, Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, with full military honors this month in the same Lawson, Missouri, cemetery where his father and grandfather are buried. Patten died 74 years ago during the Korean War, but spent decades buried as an unknown in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii. “I just, I ached. I mean, it hurt. You know, I just felt so bad. Even though I didn’t know him, I loved him,” Kennedy said. Patten's funeral was a simple affair with just a few family members. But often when veterans who fought decades earlier are identified, people waving flags and holding signs line the streets of their hometowns to herald the return of their remains. “This work is important first and foremost because these are individuals that gave their lives to protect our freedom, and they paid the ultimate sacrifice. So we’re here holding that promise that we’ll return them home to their families,” Brown said.

Often there are compelling details, Brown said. One of her first cases involved the intact remains of a World War I Marine found in a forest in France with his wallet still in his pocket. The wallet, initialed G.H., contained a New York Times article describing plans for the offensive in which he ultimately died. He also had an infantryman badge with his name and the year he received it on the back. Before leaving France with the remains, the team visited a local cemetery where other soldiers were buried and learned there were only two missing soldiers with the initials G.H. Brown had a fair idea who that soldier was before his remains even arrived in the lab. That veteran was buried in Arlington National Cemetery and Brown often visits his grave when she is in Washington D.C. Most cases aren’t that easy. A worker looks at objects in a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. Charlie Neibergall, Associated Press The experts who work at the lab must piece together identities by looking at historical records about where the remains were found and which soldiers were in the area. They then consult the list of possible names and use the bones, objects found with them, military medical records and DNA to confirm their identities. They focus on battles and plane crashes where they have the greatest chance of success because of available information. But their work can be complicated if soldiers were buried in a temporary cemetery and moved when a unit was forced to retreat. And unidentified soldiers were often buried together. When remains are brought to the lab, they sometimes include an extra bone. Experts then spend months or even years matching the bones and waiting for DNA and other test results to confirm their identities. One test even can identify if the soldier grew up primarily eating rice or a corn-based diet. The lab also compares specific traits of collar bones to the chest X-rays the military routinely took of soldiers before they were deployed. It helps that the military keeps extensive records of all soldiers. Those clues help the experts put together the puzzle of someone's identity. “It’s not always easy. It’s certainly not instantaneous,” Brown said. “Some of the cases, we really have to fight to get to that spot, because some of them have been gone for 80 years.” A man looks at a damaged car after a tornado hit the day before, Sunday, May 26, 2024, in Valley View, Texas.

        "content": "The Kelowna Rockets have signed Owen Hayden, their first-round pick (ninth overall) from the 2024 WHL Prospects Draft, to a WHL Scholarship and Development Agreement. “I am excited to sign with the Rockets,” Hayden said. “Kelowna is such a great city and the organization has developed so many amazing defencemen, including Shea Weber and Tyler Myers.” At just 15 years old, the 6-foot-6, 194-pound defenceman has already made a name for himself. Hayden led the Calgary NWCAA U15 AAA Flames (AEHL) defense in scoring this season, racking up 24 points (1 goal, 23 assists) and 40 penalty minutes over 30 games. In the playoffs, he added another eight penalty minutes in four games. “Owen is a puck-moving defender who utilizes his size and reach to disrupt plays,” said Rockets assistant general manager Curtis Hamilton. “We are excited to welcome Owen and his family to the Rockets.” The WHL Scholarship provides players with a year of post-secondary education for each season they play in the WHL. The scholarship covers tuition, fees, and textbooks, allowing players to attend universities, colleges, technical institutes, and trade schools.",

        "content": "Former Germany and Bayern Munich manager Hansi Flick is on the verge of officially becoming the new manager of FC Barcelona, replacing the outbound Xavi Hernandez. For a brief period of time, he was linked with possibly making a return to Bayern to replace Thomas Tuchel, as was Julian Nagelsmann, but Flick wanted to experience a new challenge in a different country for the next chapter of his life. Flick will have a full summer transfer window to help with his squad planning efforts at Barcelona before his first full season in charge of the club, and reports have suggested he is going to be looking towards the Bundesliga for some of his transfer targets. In a market he knows quite well given his time as Bayern’s manager, the German national team manager, and his long tenure as an assistant member of Joachim Löw’s Germany coaching staff. Naturally, there have been rumors that Flick would like to try to bring Bayern’s Joshua Kimmich to Barcelona, but information from Az’s Maximilian Koch (via @iMiaSanMia ) suggests that is not a hot topic at the moment for either club. With the European Championships right around the corner for Germany, that is Kimmich’s full focus at the moment. Photo by Stefan Matzke - sampics/Corbis via Getty Images Kimmich’s current contract at Bayern is set to expire in June 2025, so it is a crucial period for the player in terms of needing to get his future sorted out, whether that is with Bayern, or elsewhere. So far, there have not been concrete talks yet between the player and the club’s front office, though Max Eberl and Christoph Freund will certainly have to open discussions as soon as they can after the Euros have ended. Kimmich does not have an agent and currently represents himself, which should help the contract talk process go smoother as it is a more direct line of communication without the presence of an agent or representatives, but only time will how negotiations will go. He will more than likely have conversations with Vincent Kompany about the upcoming season and where he sees Kimmich in his Bayern side as a part of the contract talk process. The time they are a changin’ at Bayern Munich. Vincent Kompany looks like he is taking over in Bavaria, while the club’s former favorite son — Hansi Flick — is heading to FC Barcelona . Which one will make out better with their new club? We’ll find out, but in the meantime, there could also be some Bayern players who are on Flick’s transfer radar, too. basically, we’ve got a lot to talk about with all of that, plus some appreciation for Bayer Leverkusen’s incredible season. You can check all of that out on the Bavarians Podcast Works Show, which is available on Spotify or below: Related Hansi Flick’s four-step plan to raid the Bundesliga for FC Barcelona Report: Bayern Munich wants winger, stiker, holding midfielder — and maybe a left-back and a center-back, too",

        "content": "May 27, (THEWILL) – Critical stakeholders in Uyo Senatorial District have taken the lead by unanimously endorsing Umo Eno for a second term in office as Governor of Akwa Ibom State come 2027. The political leaders, under the aegis of the Akwa Ibom North East Consultative Forum, the apex sociopolitical organisation in Uyo Senatorial District, revealed that the confidence vote in the Governor and endorsement for his mandatory seven more years, as the State Chief Executive, followed a thorough assessment of the governor’s performance in his first year in office. According to them, this period has been marked by significant achievements across various sectors, with notable progress in education, agriculture, road infrastructure, youth development, healthcare, security, and many other areas as enshrined in the ARISE Agenda. Leader of the Forum, who is also the Political Leader of Uyo Senatorial District, Senator Effiong Bob, while addressing the stakeholders and Newsmen, who converged on his Uyo abode on Monday, specifically eulogised Governor Umo Eno’s visionary leadership, his commitment to good governance, and his dedication to the welfare of Akwa Ibom people. He emphasised that the Governor has earned the support of all citizens and residents, and therefore, will be re-elected, just like his predecessors – Obong Victor Attah, Chief Godswill Akpabio, and Mr Udom Emmanuel – who all served eight unbroken years as Governors. “In the area of road infrastructure, numerous projects such as the newly inaugurated 3.3km Idua road, the intervention work at the collapsed area of Afia Nsit Road both in Eket, the just inaugurated 160m span Nto Ide Ikot Amba Bridge with 800m Approach road in Obot Akara, the newly commissioned Paul Ekpo Crescent, Emmanuel Ekon Avenue, Obot Emem Street, the commissioning of the reconstructed section of Atiku Abubakar road with walkways, drainage systems solar street lights, with flood control tunnel as well as the Afaha Ube Road, including the Akpan Andem Market in Uyo road, to mention but a few, are all eloquent testimonials to the Governor’s Midas touch in the area road infrastructure. “In the area of Youth and Manpower development, the governor through the Ibom Leadership and Entrepreneurial Development Centre, trained and doled out seed capital to over 800 youths and entrepreneurs as a strategic attempt to fanning the embers of enterprise development. In Healthcare delivery, the governor has already built, and equipped new model healthcare centres and reconstructed existing ones, inaugurated them and handed these facilities to our people for us. In Security management, which is one of the pillars of his ARISE agenda, our visionary leader and Governor, apart from donating utility vehicles to security agencies in the state, has provided the needed support for these agencies to help maintain peace and security in our state. The Governor has also envisioned and launched the IBOM COMMUNITY watch to bolster the job done by existing security agencies. “In Education, the reconstructed, remodelled and inaugurated Christ the King, and Ewet Primary Schools projects, the opening of the flagship Dakkada Skills Acquisition Centre and constitution of the school’s Governing Council, the training of Principals of Public Secondary Schools by UK Education officials, frequent grants to students, donation of school uniforms and sandals to students, among others are some of the very strategic investments Pastor Umo Eno has made in this sector that has earned him the applause and admiration of all Akwa Ibomites. “Today, the songs of mourning that were becoming permanent in the mouths of retirees in Akwa Ibom on account of the unsettled backlog of gratuities have been swiftly replaced with songs of thanksgiving and gratitude owing to the Governor’s swift intervention in clearing the backlog of these gratuities, the former member representing Nigeria in the ECOWAS parliament highlighted. However, based on these achievements and more, the stakeholders, in a motion moved by Hon. Paul Ekpo, member representing Etinan/Nsit Ubium/Nsit Ibom Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, and seconded by Rt. Hon. Kufre Abasi Edidem, Deputy Speaker of the Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly, passed a unanimous vote of confidence in Governor Umo Eno. The stakeholders observed that Uyo Senatorial District has consistently demonstrated goodwill by supporting other senatorial districts in their rotational tenure as governor. Emphasising the spirit of reciprocity, they asserted that it was now the turn of Uyo Senatorial District to receive support from other districts, assuring that the remaining seven years of Pastor Eno will be a period of unprecedented prosperity for Akwa Ibomites, marked by sustained transformation and development. Meanwhile, the forum took the opportunity to applaud President Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Senate President, Senator Godswill Akpabio, for their exemplary display of bipartisan cooperation and harmonious relationship with Governor Umo Eno, despite belonging to a different political party. The Stakeholders noted that this remarkable collaboration will undoubtedly yield significant development and progress for both Akwa Ibom State and Nigeria, as a whole, setting a shining example of unity and productive governance. The event was attended by a diverse range of prominent figures including Obong T.O. Akpan, Deputy Leader of the Akwa Ibom North East Consultative Forum; Obong (Dr) Ekaette Ebong Okon, Secretary General; Hon Lawrence Udosen, Deputy State Chairman of PDP and Rt Hon KufreAbasi Edidem, Deputy Speaker of AKHA. Others include Obong Paul Ekpo, Member representing Etinan Federal Constituency; Barr Ime Okon, representing Itu/Ibiono Ibom Federal Constituency, Chairman of SUBEB; Rt Hon Anietie Etuk, Hon Ibanga Brownson; Rt Hon Otobong Bob, Deputy Leader of the State House of Assembly; and other members of AKHA from the district. The list also included the Political Adviser of the Governor; Prince Godwin Ntukudeh, Administrative Secretary of the Forum; Chief P.J. Effiong, Chief of Staff to the Chairman of the forum; Isantim Kenneth Okon, wife of the former Governor; Mrs Funmi Idongesit Nkanga, former SSG; Obonganwan Grace Ekong, a renowned Estate Surveyor Obong James Iniama, Transition Chairmen from Uyo senatorial district; notable Board chairmen and SSAs from the district as well as critical stakeholders and elders of the party from the Uyo senatorial district, among others.",

My [Off-Broadway’s ] family knows how to bring the community together!” Bleu, 35, captioned an Instagram video on Sunday, May 27. “Can’t believe it’s been almost 20 years since I’ve done this.” In the clip, the star is jumping rope on a New York City street as his 2007 song “Push It to the Limit” from the Disney Channel Original Movie plays in the background. Bleu starred alongside in the DCOM, which premiered in January 2007. (Bleu is currently starring as Seymour Krelborn in an Off-Broadway production of s.) The film followed the story of Izzy Daniels (Bleu) a teenage boxing prodigy who finds himself on a Double Dutch team coached by longtime friend Mary (Palmer). Throughout the movie, Izzy has to decide if he wants to be a Golden Gloves winner like his father or help his new friends win a regional Double Dutch championship. The film’s director, , told in January 2022 that both Bleu and Palmer, 30, did their own stunts on the film’s set. “What’s just so amazing with that group of actors is that they could do all of that jump roping,” Hoen recalled. “It’s amazingly hard, and all the tricks, they were completely into those and learning how to do them.” Palmer has also looked back at her time making the movie, revealing that she had her first kiss on camera with Bleu. “That was my first kiss in life,” Palmer, 30, said during an interview with in July 2020. “Even though that wasn’t my real first kiss, it was my actual first kiss ... I remember just feeling excited and it was cool because I had a cool person to kiss, Corbin is pretty good looking.” Palmer admitted she was “scared” as well. “The most fun part about this movie was that I was around my peers — people my own age,” she recalled.

        "description": "As there are no chairs or benches here, four of our family members were sitting on the floor outside the ICU last night. Moreover, hospital staff have switched off the fans during this summer, says Yedukondalu, a hospital visitor",
        "content": "More than the patients admitted in a hospital, their family members face a lot of troubles while taking care of them day and night. If it is a government hospital, then the problems are endless. The patients and their attendants are suffering due to lack of basic facilities such as drinking water and furniture at A.C. Subba Reddy Government General Hospital (GGH) in SPS Nellore. “As there are no chairs or benches here, four of our family members were sitting on the floor outside the intensive care unit (ICU) last night. Moreover, the hospital staff have switched off the fans during this summer,” said Yedukondalu, a visitor. Another caretaker, B. Eswar, complained that the reverse osmosis (RO) drinking water filter was not working and he was forced to drink water from an earthen pot in which some patients had dipped their fingers while trying to drink water using a glass. Similarly, there are many complaints from the attendants of patients that the sockets used for charging mobile phones were not functioning in almost every block of the hospital. They were unable to make important calls to reveal the health condition of their family members. The toilets and the surrounding areas look untidy. The hospital wards, where the doctors go for rounds, were maintained neatly, but not other places. The sanitation staff and kin of the patients were blaming each other for the unhygienic atmosphere in the premises. While the sanitation workers alleged that the people coming from rural areas were littering everywhere, the attendants of patients’ complained that the outdoor spaces were not cleaned regularly. Asifa, a relative of an expectant mother said, “To avoid the bad smell at the time of eating, we prefer having food outside the maternity block. The waiting halls were too horrible with the marks of tobacco spit left on the walls. Denying all these allegations, GGH Superintendent Dr. B.S. Naik told The Hindu that all facilities were available in the hospital. He informed that three RO water filters were donated by Nellore MP Vemireddy Prabhakar Reddy. “We have also repaired an existing water dispenser ahead of the summer. Apart from these, we have kept drinking water pots in the wards so that the patients and their caretakers do not face any problem during this season,” he informed. When asked about lack of furniture in the hospital, Dr. Naik said, “It is not good for both the patients and visitors to keep chairs near the ICU. It is highly infectious area. So, we avoid putting chairs or benches. Some people sit down despite warnings from the hospital staff.” Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Andhra Pradesh",

With multiple kiosks closed, the customer walked away empty-handed and angry, taking to social media with their complaints. Gripes with self-checkout are all too common across retailers, with many coming from fed-up Walmart and Target shoppers as both retailers implemented policy changes over the past few months. Walmart instituted privileges for Walmart+ shoppers this past spring and customers are still reeling from the shake-up. The big box retailer began reserving certain self-checkout lanes for Walmart+ members, leading regular customers to complain, with some even spreading rumors that it costs to use self-checkout. On X , the website formerly known as Twitter, one shopper ranted about their recent experiences. \"@walmart anytime I go to one of your stores & lines are ridiculous because you only have a few registers open in favor of self-checkout/walmart+ checkout,\" they said in a post . \"I'm leaving behind a full cart full of goods,\" they continued. \"I'm not dealing with your register staffing nonsense. #selfcheckoutsucks Another user said they were \"shook by the difficulty to simply checkout\" and described the situation at his Walmart. \"No registers open and self checkout with 3 kiosks working with a massive line,\" he said. \"No touch pay either, swipe or chip only.\" He referred to it as \"bizarre\" for a company the size of Walmart. Another user replied to him saying they've \"given up on Walmart for good\" due to theft affecting their past purchases. \"If it wasn’t for their pricing, I wouldn’t go there and even that isn’t what it used to be,\" said another. As far as long lines and lack of kiosks go, several shoppers are frustrated with the disappearance and reappearance of new kiosks amid policy changes. \"This is SO stupid! So they put these things in to make people crazy and spark arguments about whether or not people like them. Then when we are all used to them and some of us love them....they make a big deal and take them out,\" one shopper wrote on Facebook . The U.S. Sun reached out to Walmart in a request for comment. Long lines aren't the only thing extending Walmart shoppers' trips. *If you click a link in this boxout, we may earn affiliate revenue Here's how to sign up to Walmart+ : Remember to cancel before the 30 days are up, or pay $12.95 per month (which you can cancel at any time) or $98 for the annual plan if you want to keep it. Read More Customers are saying they can't find anything they're looking for after the store recently made layout changes across the US. A new app called Hyper allows customers to enter their grocery list and then gives them directions around the store to locate the items. Walmart's app already offer maps to help customers find their way through stores, but with recent layout changes, some say they need more assistance. Last month, stores in St. Louis, Missouri, and Cleveland, Ohio announced they would be closing their self-checkout kiosks for good. Plus, here's how Target is following in Walmart's footsteps with rollbacks and big changes.",

        "content": "Asserting that Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) will win all 14 seats in the Lok Sabha polls, former Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren’s wife Kalpana Soren on Monday compared Bharatiya Janata Party with Bririshers, “who were known for looting people.” She also vented her ire on BJP for calling them Vanvasi instead of Adivasi adding that they take pride in their jal, jungle and zameen, calling Adivasis as true revolutionaries, who fought against the Britishers when nobody thought to do so. “The people of Jharkhand have made up their minds to support the candidates of the INDIA bloc. I cannot say about the country, but in Jharkhand, we are winning all 14 seats...” she said. “We are fulfilling our political obligations with all honesty. Election campaigning is on in full swing... Dumka has been the stronghold of JMM and we are going to win here again,” she added. Kalpana formally made an entry into politics on March 4, this year. In the last few months, she has become a key face of the INDIA bloc in Jharkhand. She is contesting the bypoll from Gandey Assembly seat on a Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) ticket. Launching an attack against the Bharatiya Janata Party, she said, “BJP feels irritated to even utter the word Adivasi. They don’t even call us Adivasi. They call us Vanvasi. But we have been here since the beginning. We take pride in our jal, jungle and zameen. Our great ancestors were true revolutionaries. They fought against the Britishers even when nobody thought to do so. We have the same blood in our veins. BJP is another form of British to loot people.” Notably, the Santhal revolt (also known as the Hul revolt ) started on 30th June 1855, with the help of prominent leaders like Sidhu, Kanhu, Chand, and Bhairav, and also their two sisters Phulo and Jhano. The depressed and anguished Santhals engaged in guerrilla warfare against the Britishers and formed their own troops which included the farmers, villagers, and the women. In this quest, they were able to capture large parts of land including Rajmahal Hills, Bhagalpur district, and Birbhum. Regarding Kalpana Soren’s statement about comparing BJP with Britishers, Jharkhand BJP chief, Babulal Marandi said, “The Congress party with which they have formed an alliance, their founders were Britishers...Congress party is a remnant of the British...BJP which was earlier JanSangh, was founded by leaders of India on Indian soil.” Notably, in 2019, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won 12 seats in Jharkhand, with the BJP alone winning 11. The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Congress got one seat each",

Varanasi is the land of Kashi and whoever comes here is only at the orders of Baba Vishwanath. PM Modi is contesting elections from here... I have seen that the 2019 Lok Sabha elections witnessed greater enthusiasm than that of the 2014 polls. It is even greater in 2024, ” said the BJP leader while speaking to ANI reporter in Uttar Pradesh’s Varanasi. “People from inside are enthusiastic. Only development has been given importance. The development done by PM Modi is being discussed...” said Giriraj Singh. Notably, Varanasi is the stronghold of the Bharatiya Janata Party and PM Modi. This will be the most anticipated contest in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. PM Modi won the constituency with a resounding majority in both the 2014 and 2019 general polls. Congress has pitted Ajay Rai against PM Modi. Rai is the Opposition INDIA bloc’s joint nominee against the Prime Minister. The UP Congress chief, Rai, was also fielded by the Congress against the PM in Varanasi in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha polls, but he finished third both times. This is the third time Ajay Rai will face Modi in a Lok Sabha contest. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, PM Modi won the seat with over 6,74,664 votes and commanded a vote share of 63.6 per cent. In 2014, Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency witnessed a clash between Narendra Modi, then the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate and AAP chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. PM Modi won the elections with a margin exceeding 3 lakh votes. In 2014, PM Modi contested two Lok Sabha seats- from Gujarat’s Vadodara and Uttar Pradesh’s Varanasi",

        "description": "Per the rankings from Baseball America, he was the Nationals’ No. 1 prospect in three straight years from 2017 to 2019.",
        "content": "The Nationals announced today that outfielder Lane Thomas has been reinstated from the injured list with fellow outfielder Víctor Robles designated for assignment in a corresponding move. The club’s 40-man roster count drops to 38. Robles, now 27, was once the club’s top prospect and one of the top prospects in the entire league. Per the rankings from Baseball America , he was the Nationals’ No. 1 prospect in three straight years from 2017 to 2019. He was also on BA’s top 100 league-wide list from 2016 to 2019, getting as high as No. 5 overall going into 2018. The expectation at that time was that Robles had the capability of being an all-around contributor and a long-term part of the outfield in Washington. Things seemed to be in a good place in 2019, the year the Nats won the World Series. Robles hit 17 home runs and slashed .255/.326/.419. Despite the long balls, his 5.7 percent walk rate kept the on-base low and the wRC+ of 92 indicates he was actually a bit below average offensively overall. But thanks to above-average defense and stealing 28 bases, FanGraphs credited him as being worth 3.7 wins above replacement in his age-22 season. Given his youth, the Nats undoubtedly expected him to continue evolving as a hitter as he aged. Unfortunately, things moved in the opposite direction in the years to come. From 2020 to 2022, Robles got into 291 games with the Nats but hit just .216/.291/.306 in that time for a wRC+ of 66. The club’s fortunes also faded in that time and they entered a rebuilding phase. That theoretically left Robles with plenty of playing time to get back on track, but his health hasn’t really allowed him to do so. He only got into 36 games last year due to back spasms in the lumbar spine. He did perform well when on the field, hitting a solid .299/.385/.364, but hasn’t carried that over in 2024. He spent about a month on the injured list due to left hamstring strain and has produced a brutal line of .120/.281/.120 in the 14 games he has played. Robles was slated to reach free agency after the 2024 campaign and the Nationals were likely hoping for a nice run of play this season, at least allowing them to flip Robles for something at the deadline before he slipped away from them for nothing. Unfortunately, his performance hasn’t inspired much confidence and they are cutting him off the roster today. They will now have a week to trade him or pass him through waivers, though any interest is likely to be fairly modest after years of poor performance and injury absences. He’s making a salary of $2.65M this year, with still about two-thirds of that left to be paid out. Perhaps the Nats will try to eat some of that money to facilitate a deal but it’s also possible that Robles just ends up released. He has enough service time that he can reject an outright assignment in favor of free agency while keeping all that money intact. It’s undeniably been a disappointing few years and hardly what the club had in mind, given the prospect pedigree and the promising start to his career. But for Robles personally, it’s not too late for him to find a second act somewhere. He just turned 27 last week and could perhaps get back on track with a run of good health and the right opportunity.

        "content": "Three men arrested in connection with the game zone fire that claimed 28 lives have been sent to a 14-day police remand by a court in the Rajkot district on Monday. The court of additional judicial magistrate BP Thakar remanded three accused Yuvraj Hari Singh Solanki, Nitin Jain and Rahul Rathod in police custody for two weeks, special public prosecutor Tushar Gokani said. [{f16f1bcf-e868-4fe6-bbde-7c594c7407bf:intradmin/ANI-20240527171602.jpg}] Speaking to the media on Monday, Special Public Prosecutor Tushar Gokani said, “Today the accused were brought before the honourable court and further police custody of 14 days was sought. Out of 6 accused named in the FIR, 3 accused persons were arrested, of which two are named in the FIR and one of them was not named.” “The main ground of remand was that they were not cooperating during the investigation. They (the accused) are giving ‘evasive replies’ to whatever questions are asked and whatever documents are asked. They are saying it was burnt in the incident. They are not cooperating in the investigation and that was the main ground — to seek their cooperation and elicit truth from them,” said the official. “We told the court that the main accused are on the run, and these accused persons make evasive replies and are not cooperating with the investigating agencies,” Gokani said. He said that accused Solanki tried to put up an act in his bid to express before the court that he was filled with remorse for whatever happened. “When he entered the court, he tried to project that he had remorse for the incident and everyone felt that he was crying. After five minutes, he was laughing and arguing with the court,” Gokani said. “This very accused seemed like he was crying as soon as he entered the court but in just a few minutes he started laughing and he said that ‘these kinds of things happen,’ which was taken in a serious note by the honourable court,” said Gokani. SPP Gokani further said that the police are investigating all the facets of the said documents, investigation on the matter is underway. Two partners in Raceway Enterprise, which operated the TRP game zone, Yuvraj Hari Singh Solanki and Rahul Rathod, and the manager of the recreation centre, Nitin Jain, are now in police custody. The officials have been held responsible “for their gross negligence in allowing this game zone to operate without necessary approvals,” according to a government release. The FIR has been filed against six people, including TRP Game Zone owner Yuvraj Hari Singh Solanki, manager Nitin Jain, and others at Rajkot Taluka Police Station. Earlier in the day, Bharatiya Janata Party leader and Rajya Sabha MP Rambhai Mokariya visited the families of Rajkot fire incident victims on Monday. Confirming the death toll, he said, “The official death toll stands at 28. It has not increased and any number other than that is just a rumour.” The Gujarat government ordered the suspension of seven officials, including two police inspectors and civic staff of Rajkot Municipal Corporation, for dereliction of duty in connection with the fire incident at a gaming zone in Rajkot. Following the incident, all the gaming zones in Vadodara were inspected and temporarily shut down",

We’ve seen it year after year after year.” The most recent BC Winter Games were held in Quesnel and Barkerville in February. The 2026 event will be hosted by Trail and Rossland. The Olympics-style event takes place every other year, pitting B.C.’s best young athletes against one another. Kamloops has twice hosted the BC Winter Games in the past — the inaugural event in 1979 and again in 2018. The event typically attracts more than 2,000 athletes, as well as parents, coaches and officials.",

        "content": "President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan discussed the ongoing humanitarian crisis and Israeli attacks on Gaza, Türkiye-Spain relations and other developments with Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Monday, the Communications Directorate said. Erdoğan told Sanchez that Israel's massacres against Palestinians must be immediately halted and Tel Aviv needs to be forced to abide by international law. Israeli airstrikes targeted a camp for the displaced Palestinians in the Rafah safe zone, killing at least 45 civilians, mostly women and children, who burned to death. The president also said Türkiye welcomes Spain's decision to recognize Palestine's statehood. He said this step would contribute to the facilitation of peace and justice in the region, as well as efforts for a two-state solution. Last week, Sanchez said that Spain's council of ministers would recognize an independent Palestinian state on May 28. The announcement came around the same time that the Irish and Norwegian leaders announced they would do the same on the same date. In his speech, Sanchez said he has been talking to leaders and studying the situation in Palestine and understands one thing clearly: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin \"Netanyahu does not have a peace project for Palestine.\" Sanchez said that the Israeli leader is refusing to listen to the international community as he continues to bomb civilian infrastructure and block desperately needed aid. Around 144 out of 193 member-states of the United Nations recognize Palestine as a state, including most of the global south, Russia, China and India. But only a handful of the 27 EU members have done so so far, mostly former Communist countries as well as Sweden and the Greek Cypriot administration. Britain, Australia and EU member Malta have indicated in recent months that they could soon follow suit. Recognition of a Palestinian state is still opposed for now by Israel's closest ally the United States, which has the power to veto it at the United Nations and did so last month. Washington says it favors Palestinian statehood eventually, but only as a result of negotiations with Israel, a position it shares with European powers including France and Germany. No negotiations over Palestinian statehood have taken place since the last round of talks collapsed a decade ago. Israel launched its genocidal war on Gaza in retaliation for the Oct. 7 incursion by Hamas, which killed around 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages. Israel's operations in the Palestinian enclave have killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Israel claimed recognizing Palestinian statehood now would effectively reward Hamas for its attacks. Spain and its allies have spent months lobbying European nations, including France, Portugal, Belgium and Slovenia, to garner support for the recognition of a Palestinian state.",

        "description": "Police say the incident could be a fallout of a scuffle that took place at the bar.",
        "content": "A 30-year-old disc jockey (DJ) was shot dead at a bar in Jharkhand capital Ranchi late on May 26 at night by a man carrying what appeared to be a sophisticated rifle. The police on Monday arrested the accused, identified as Abhishek Singh, from Gaya in Bihar. The victim, Sandip Pramanik, a resident of West Bengal, worked at the bar. The CCTV footage of the incident shows a man, with his face covered, shooting at the chest of the DJ with a rifle from point blank range. Talking to The Hindu , Ranchi Senior Superintendent of Police Chandan Kumar Sinha said, “We have arrested the accused within 15 hours of the incident. The accused’s name is Abhishek Singh alias Vicky, a resident of Ranchi. We have also formed an SIT (Special Investigation Team) to investigate the case. The police are also interrogating three people in the case.” The SSP said that soon after the incident, the police started an investigation into it. During the course of the investigation, the police learnt that Singh had fled to Gaya following which they informed the Bihar police, who arrested him from the Alipur locality. The accused changed vehicles at several places while on the way to Bihar, and the vehicles were seized, he said. Mr. Sinha said the accused was in a drunk state when the crime was carried out. “In video footage, he is being seen alone. It needs to be found out whether he was alone or other persons were also involved in the crime,” the SSP said. Later, talking to mediapersons, the SSP said, “The incident occurred around midnight. When police reached the spot of the incident, there was no witness. It was a blind case for the police. Then, we set up seven teams. With the help of technical support and preliminary inquiries, the layer in the incident started opening.” He said that prima facie it was known that there was a scuffle between the bouncers and customers, including the accused, at the bar around 10.30 p.m. Around 1.18 a.m., the DJ was standing near a lift just outside the bar and waiting for a taxi, when the accused shot him, the SSP said. “There was no one excluding the DJ at that time. It appears that after the fight with bouncers, the accused, who was in an alcoholic state, came for revenge,” he said. Mr. Sinha said the rifle used in the crime had been recovered. “After searching the house of the accused, we recovered two arms licences issued from the State of Assam in his name. We are verifying if they are authentic. The accused did not deposit his arms, while we had repeatedly requested armholders to deposit their weapons in view of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) for the Lok Sabha polls,” he said. The accused is a businessman, who holds agencies of a cold drinks and a cigarette company. The bar management said the accused and his friends had an argument with the DJ and some other employees of the bar. In a statement, the Gaya police said, “Ranchi SSP asked for cooperation in arresting the accused of the Ranchi case. In the light of the request, Gaya Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Ashish Bharti directed all the sub-divisional police officers and police station heads to conduct a special vehicle checking in the entire district and action was initiated to arrest the said accused by a special team.“ (WIth PTI inputs) Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Jharkhand / Ranchi / crime, law and justice / murder",

        "description": "Thiruvananthapuram mourns the loss of Manu, a beloved Bengal tiger at the local zoo. His 17-year journey symbolizes the importance of conservation efforts. Despite facing health challenges, Manu's legacy inspires future generations to appreciate and protect wildlife. The zoo reaffirms its commitment to animal welfare and raising awareness about endangered species. Manu's passing marks the end of an era but underscores the interconnectedness of all living beings and our responsibility to safeguard their future.",
        "content": "In the early hours of a serene morning in Thiruvananthapuram, the city awoke to the somber news that Manu , the venerable Bengal tiger who had been a part of the local zoo 's family for 17 years, had passed away. The news spread quickly, touching the hearts of the community and wildlife enthusiasts alike. Manu's story is one that began on January 13, 2007, when he was born to his mother Karishma at the zoo. Over the years, he grew to become a majestic creature, admired by visitors and cared for by the dedicated staff. His presence was a constant, a familiar sight for those who frequented the zoo, and he was often the highlight of many a visitor's trip. However, in December 2023, it became apparent that Manu was facing health challenges. He was diagnosed with liver-related issues, and despite the best efforts of the veterinary team led by Dr. Nikesh Kiran, his condition began to deteriorate. In his final months, Manu was fed boneless mutton, soup, and milk, a diet designed to ease his discomfort and provide him with the necessary nutrients. As Manu aged, his resilience waned. The zoo staff made accommodations to ensure his comfort, moving him to a special cage equipped with infrared lighting to maintain warmth. Yet, even with this care, the tiger's health continued to decline, and he eventually succumbed to pneumonia, a complication arising from his underlying condition. The loss of Manu is felt deeply by the Thiruvananthapuram zoo community. He was a symbol of the wild's beauty and the delicate balance of nature's ecosystems. His passing marks the end of an era for the zoo and is a poignant moment to reflect on the importance of conservation efforts for these magnificent creatures. Tigers, in general, have an average lifespan of around 12 years in the wild, but in captivity, they can live longer due to the absence of threats and the availability of consistent care. Manu's 17-year journey is in due part to the care he received and the bond he shared with those who looked after him. The zoo's commitment to providing a safe haven for animals like Manu is unwavering. While the void left by his departure cannot be filled, the legacy of his life will continue to inspire and educate future generations about the wonders and vulnerabilities of wildlife. Manu's final rites were conducted with respect and in accordance with the regulations of the National Tiger Conservation Authority . As the zoo and its patrons mourn his loss, they also celebrate the life of a tiger that brought joy and awe to so many. In the wake of this event, the zoo reaffirms its dedication to the welfare of its inhabitants and to raising awareness about the plight of endangered species. The memory of Manu will live on, urging us to appreciate and protect the diverse array of life with which we share our planet. His story, while unique, is part of a larger narrative that highlights the interconnectedness of all living beings and the responsibility we hold to safeguard their future.",

        "description": "The Novato resident, a school board trustee for more than four decades, was 84.",
        "content": "Patricia Warren, a longtime trustee of both the Marin County Board of Education and the Novato Unified School District, died Tuesday. She was 84. Ms. Warren, an advocate for women’s rights and the namesake of an treatment center for women who were victims of domestic violence, died of complications from a massive stroke, according to her son Mark Warren, a Colorado resident. “She was an amazing woman who cared very deeply for her community,” he said. “She did everything she could to make positive changes for people’s lives.” Ms. Warren, a Novato resident, was born near Boston on Feb. 29, 1940, to Mitchell Anderson, a founding pilot of Northeast Airlines, and Mary Coggins. She received a bachelor’s degree in 1961 from Sweetbriar College in Virginia. After college, she married Robert Warren, her sweetheart since 10th grade at Arlington High School, in 1962. The couple were married for 62 years. Her husband is a retired civil engineer and was an engineering manager for the Golden Gate Bridge. On June 30, 2022, Ms. Warren retired from her seat on the county education board, where she had served for 35 years. Prior to that, she was a trustee at Novato Unified School District for nine years. “While we are saddened by her passing, we also take this time to acknowledge and celebrate her good work that changed countless lives for the better and that will be felt for generations to come,” John Carroll, Marin superintendent of schools, said in a letter to the education community. Noting Ms. Warren’s “remarkable 44-year commitment to education,” Carroll described her as a “fearless, passionate, and tireless advocate for those in our schools and community most in need of extra services and support.” “She believed that every child deserves the best possible education,” Carroll said. “She was especially supportive of the students in alternative education served through Marin’s Community School and other programs.” Ms. Warren’s career included roles as a staff member at Planned Parenthood and Marin Abused Women’s Services, and as the coordinator of the Marin Women’s Commission and co-founder of the Marin Women’s Hall of Fame. “From championing the rights of children in alternative and special education, to being an early advocate for policies ensuring equity in pay and hiring practices for women, there are many significant and lasting examples of Pat’s leadership and good work,” Carroll said. In the late 1970s, Ms. Warren was a staff member at Marin Abused Women’s Services and was also a Rape Crisis Center board member. It was later known as Community Violence Solutions. In 2003, the organization dedicated the Patricia Warren Center of Community Violence Solutions, recognizing her work on behalf of women, children and families. Ms. Warren “steadfastly stood against violence, sex discrimination and injustice,” the organization’s announcement said at the time. Mary Jane Burke, former Marin superintendent of schools, said Ms. Warren also supported education projects to help youths with substance abuse problems, special needs or alternative education and regional occupational programs. “Through budget cuts and budget windfalls, staff layoffs and staff hiring, program take-back and program development, Pat never lost sight of trying to do what was best for students and families while also meeting the needs of local districts,” Burke said when Ms. Warren stepped down from the county board of education. In addition to her husband and son, Ms. Warren is survived by another son, Michael Warren, a resident of the Lake Tahoe area. Memorial services are pending.",

        "content": "The deadline for applying for the post of Team India's head coach has ended on Monday. Following that, the Board of Control for Cricket in India and its top name, chose to be silent. After the Kolkata Knight Riders' IPL 2024 triumph, the name of Gautam Gambhir is getting more attention. With both parties not commenting anything on the matter, it seems that the Indian board doesn't have too many options available for the position. ADVERTISEMENT Currently, most of the Indian team players have travelled to New York for the T20 World Cup 2024 under the guidance of head coach Rahul Dravid. The only thing confirmed is that no foreign player has applied for the position after the board's secretary Jay Shah clarified that the Board is looking at someone who has risen through the ranks and knows the domestic structure. It could be safe to say that the board's primary target was who is currently the head of National Cricket Academy. But the veteran seems to be least interested in a full-time position which demands him to be available for 10 months a year. \"The deadline is fine, but the BCCI brass wouldn't mind taking some more time before reaching a decision. Right now, the team will be busy with World T20 for the better part of the month of June. After that seniors will be rested from tours of Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe where any of the NCA-based senior coaches can accompany the team. So what's the hurry,\" a BCCI source told PTI on conditions of anonymity. Also, KKR principal owner Shah Rukh Khan shares a deep bond with Gautam Gambhir and it is not easy to leave an IPL team which has been a part of the identity of the former India opener. There's another aspect that needs to be looked into seriously what senior India players, currently in New York, feel about whether Gambhir can indeed be Rahul Dravid's replacement.",

        "content": "were arrested from separate places in on Monday, reported PTI citing the police. The three carried a cumulative reward of Rs 2.1 lakh on them. Ashok Korsa (25) was apprehended on Monday from Bazarpara area under the Farsegarh police limits, an official said, reported PTI. Korsa, who carried a bounty of Rs 10,000, was involved in an IED blast attack on the vehicle of a police officer on May 15, he said. ADVERTISEMENT The other two, Iriya Kadti, alias Bandu, and , were nabbed on Sunday during an anti-Naxal operation from the Peddagelur area under the Tarrem police station limits, the official said. Bandu was the president of Dandakaranya Adivasi Kisan Majdoor Sangthan (DAKMS), a front organisation of Maoists, while Lakhma was the head of the Chetna Natya Manch (CNM), the cultural wing of the banned outfit, he said. The duo carried a reward of Rs 1 lakh each, he said. As per the PTI report, the two were involved in an attack on security personnel in the forest near Gundam village in February this year. Three Naxalites, including two women, were killed in an encounter with security personnel in Maharashtra's Gadchiroli district on Monday, authorities said. According to Superintendent of Police Neelotpal, intelligence sources indicate that members of the Naxalites' Perimili Dalam were plotting subversive actions in a forest near Katrangatta hamlet in Bhamragad taluka during their ongoing Tactical Counter Offensive Campaign (TCOC), reported PTI. According to the report, responding to the intelligence, two units of , the Gadchiroli police's specialised combat wing, were dispatched to conduct a search operation in the region. During the search, the Naxalites fired indiscriminately on the teams. In response, the C-60 crew retaliated, sparking a furious exchange of gunfire. Following the cease-fire, the bodies of one male and two female Naxalites were found at the encounter site. Among them was Vasu, the Perimili Dalam's in-charge and leader, the report added. Additionally, security authorities recovered an AK-47 weapon, a carbine, an INSAS rifle, Naxal literature, and other items from the site. The anti-Naxal operation is still ongoing in the area, as Naxalites normally increase their activity during the TCOC season from March to June, hoping to build their ranks and launch large attacks on security troops because of limited forest cover, the PTI report further stated.",

        "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah killed at least 45 people, according to local officials.",
        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local officials. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its , with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it Israel’s military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night’s attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers “pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza’s population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from some of Israel’s close allies. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto, in a TV interview, said such bombings are “spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren.” Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strike. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry called it a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian terrorists and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its , in which terrorists killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory .",

        "description": "NIA busts international job scam, arrests 5 for luring Indians into cyber fraud centers",
        "content": "NEW DELHI: NIA, as part of a multi-state crackdown on organised trafficking syndicates engaged in luring Indian youths with false promise of jobs in Cambodia, Laos, Golden Triangle SEZ and forcing them to work in cyber fraud centres there, arrested five persons on Monday after raiding 15 locations across 7 states and Union territories (UTs). Among the states/UTs where NIA carried out the searches in coordination with the local police and intelligence agencies, were Maharashtra, UP, Bihar, Gujarat, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab & Chandigarh. Eight fresh FIRs were registered and five accused — Manish Hingu of Vadodara, Pahlad singh of Gopalganj, Nabialam Ray of south west Delhi, Balwant Kataria of Gurugram and Sartaj Singh of Chandigarh — arrested. NIA investigations have revealed the accused to be involved in an organised trafficking syndicate engaged in luring and trafficking Indian youth to foreign countries on the false promises of legal employment. The youths were being forced to work in fake call centers at Laos, Golden Triangle SEZ, and Cambodia, among other places, as part of the racket, controlled and operated mainly by foreign nationals. They were coerced into undertaking illegal activities online, such as credit card fraud, investments in cryptocurrency using fake applications, honey trapping etc. Investigations have further revealed that the arrested accused were coordinating with traffickers operating from across the international border to facilitate illegal border-crossing of Indian youth from Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam to Laos SEZ. They were working at the behest of foreign-based agents belonging to well organised syndicates that were active in several districts of Maharashtra, UP, Bihar, Gujrat, Delhi, Punjab, Haryana etc . These syndicates were further connected to operatives based in other parts of India, as well as foreign countries like UAE, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos SEZ etc. NIA had taken over the relevant case from Mumbai police on May 13, 2024. It found that the human trafficking syndicate was not operating merely in Mumbai but had linkages with other facilitators and traffickers in various parts of the country and across the border. The searches on Saturday led to the seizure of several incriminating materials including documents, digital devices, handwritten registers, multiple passports, bogus overseas employment letters etc, said NIA.",

        "description": "What are the various policies and schemes introduced by the Indian government with respect to menstrual hygiene management? What did a study in a Maharashtra prison reveal about women prisoners and their access to water and sanitation facilities?",
        "content": "The story so far: India has witnessed a promising shift in the landscape of menstrual hygiene management over the years. The fifth round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS 2019-2020) revealed that about eight out of 10 young women aged 15-24 years are now using safe menstrual hygiene products. While urban areas and certain demographics have seen improved usage of menstrual hygiene products, the plight of one of the most marginalised populations — women in Indian prisons — remains overlooked. In a society where prisoners are deemed unworthy of fundamental rights, female prisoners face an even greater injustice. Society clings to an unrealistic standard of female purity, refusing to accept that women, too, can commit crimes. This bias has led to a systemic oversight and neglect of female prisoner’s basic needs, including menstrual hygiene. What is the status of menstrual hygiene in prisons? According to the National Crime Records Bureau, there are 23,772 women in Indian prisons. Of them, 77% are in the reproductive age group (18-50 years) and are likely to be regular menstruators. However, the availability of sanitary napkins has been inconsistent across different prisons in the country. The quality of sanitary napkins has also been unsatisfactory. Despite recommendations outlined in the 2016 Model Prison Manual, many States have not implemented provisions like supplying adequate water and washroom facilities for female prisoners. Overcrowding and poor socio-economic conditions further exacerbate the struggle of incarcerated women to secure basic necessities such as water, sanitary napkins, detergent, and soap during menstruation. A study conducted by one of the authors (Himani Gupta) in a prison in Maharashtra in June 2023 revealed that water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities failed to meet the demands of women imprisoned there. This presents significant challenges for women, who need more water to maintain personal hygiene during menstruation. The lack of continuous water supply also forced women to store water, taking up valuable space in the limited number of toilets available. About 50 women were forced to share just two toilets for all their daily activities, including excreting, changing napkins, and washing clothes and utensils. Women also reported feeling discouraged from using the filthy washrooms for frequent urination, which led to a greater incidence of urinary infections. The study also found that prison authorities depended on sanitary napkins donated by non-governmental organisations. Decisions about the type, quality, and quantity of menstrual absorbents were left to these organisations, often resulting in the supply of substandard products. Many women reported that the quantity of sanitary napkins provided was insufficient, and that the quality was poor (subpar absorption, causing discomfort, skin rashes, and infections).In one instance, the prison received a donation of ‘reusable’ sanitary napkins. Each woman was given only one pair to manage her entire menstrual cycle. With severely limited access to water and detergent, washing these reusable napkins after each use became impractical. What have been policy interventions? India has been making consistent efforts to improve access to menstrual hygiene products, especially among young women through the Menstrual Hygiene Scheme which includes the distribution of free or subsidised sanitary napkins. To make sanitary napkins more affordable for underprivileged women, the Suraksha Suvidha Napkins are also being sold at Jan Aushadhi Kendras for ₹1 per napkin. In 2023, India took an important stride forward by formulating the ‘National Menstrual Hygiene Policy’, to recognise menstruation as a natural process that demands more meaningful attention. At its heart lies a crucial principle: ensuring equity in the safe and dignified management of menstrual hygiene. The draft policy states: “Prioritise equity to enable all menstruating individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status and geographical location, to have equal opportunities to access and manage their menstruation in a safe and hygienic way. Address disparities and barriers that prevent certain groups from accessing required menstrual hygiene products, resources and information.” Remarkably, the policy identifies prisoners as a target population with a compromised access to menstrual hygiene facilities. This inclusion reflects a positive step forward. However, the policy falls short of providing a concrete action plan to enhance menstrual hygiene management in prisons. It also overlooks the Ministry of Home Affairs as a critical stakeholder that influences menstrual hygiene management in prisons. What needs to be done? The Indian government must ensure that basic standards of menstrual hygiene for women in captivity are met. The uneven implementation of the Model Prison Manual 2016 across States demands urgent attention as well. As a first step, the government must ensure every State adheres to the recommendations outlined in the manual. The experience of menstruation within prisons presents unique challenges that demand attention through a public health lens, particularly as part of the fight against ‘period poverty’. The next step is to encourage collaboration between public health authorities and prison administrators to develop a comprehensive strategy to ensure access to adequate menstrual hygiene products and facilities while prioritising the health and dignity of women behind bars. Third, there is a dearth of empirical evidence. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct research to understand the current state of menstrual hygiene within prison walls.

        "content": "You want down-home... Potter Valley, Saturday morning...folks lined up and down Main Street, young and old and in-between, with nary a head without a cowboy hat upon it. I made sure to wear my old Shady Grady. It’s Memorial Day Weekend and the Potter Valley Spring Festival and Rodeo — over 77 years and going strong — first held in 1946 and a major fundraiser for many of the local non-profits and churches in town, takes over the town. The parade, sponsored by the Potter Valley Youth and Community Center, led by the rodeo queen and her entourage, begins a bit after 11 a.m. This year’s theme, Blue Jeans and Country Dreams, was well represented on a few of the floats but none so uniquely as the group of young horsewomen from White Dog Ranch, parade winners, whose horses’ front legs were fully be-jeaned. The parade kept coming with Jim Eddy pulling a float of happy family campers, a small flotilla of back-packing goats, a festive C&S. Waste Solutions garbage truck, about eight fire trucks with their horns a-blaring, P.V. FFA, a Save Lake Pillsbury float, Kudos for Kids on a 1952 Chevy truck with less than 20,000 miles on it, the P.V. Bible Church, a bunch of raucous Dolly Parton look-a-likes, the Pauli Family 1948 power wagon float, and more, including 7-year-old Red Bluff Junior Roundup Little Miss whose favorite thing is branding cows. She looks to have been born in the saddle. Potter Valley Youth and Community Center began sponsoring the parade back in, oh, about 2008, and Sheri Burris, director and program coordinator with PVYCC and one of the key organizers of the parade, a 60-year P.V. resident, born and raised here, remembers her mother and her best friend dressing up as clowns back in the ’70s, pulling a wagon and throwing candy. “Nobody knew who they were.” I told her this was the most down-home parade I’d ever seen. “That just warms my heart,” she says. “We’re behind the scenes and don’t always know how it’s received. This is one community event that brings people together and also brings people from out of town who used to live here. It warms my heart that it’s still going strong after all these years.” Back towards Hoppers Corner and into the rodeo grounds, the ax throwing and wood cutting competitions are up next. Ian Blundell, West Coast amateur timber sports competitor, overseeing the ax throwing competition, explains that each contestant gets four throws, and the three best are counted, one-handed or two-handed. “In the middle, the bullseye, we have the beer can, so if you pop it, you get a free drink,” he says. The arena gets quiet for the Star-Spangled Banner and soon after final adjustments are being made to the log decks and chain saws are being fired up for the wood cutting competition. Bobby Johnson, who is competing on the Johnson’s Quality Tree Care team with his father Kurt and brother KC, takes the time to explain how it works. Six log decks have been set up with five or six, 8-foot-long tan oak logs. The goal is to cut the logs into 14-18-inch rounds, split them and stack them. They have to be split in a certain way: at the widest point they can be no bigger than 9 inches and no smaller than 3 1⁄2 inches. If they are bigger or smaller, those pieces are disqualified. The goal is to get as many pieces as possible; they don’t necessarily have to be big. It’s timed at 12 minutes. And there’s nice looking belt buckles for the winners. Each three-man team gets one chain saw and two splitting mauls; if you break a maul, you’re out of luck. I ask Bobby if it’s his dad’s last year. “It’s his last year if he wins.” Year 34 for Kurt Johnson, he’s won about 50 percent of them. He and his son KC won last year and in 2014, the three family men won the championship. “It keeps me young and my boys keep me young. It if weren’t for them, I wouldn’t do it anymore. It’s a long 12 minutes. I’ll do it one more time,” he says. But Bobby said it’s your last time if you win. “This is it for sure.” Joe Goeken competing with Derick and Dustin Trimble, The Trimble Brothers Construction, has been competing since1996 and he’s won a number of times, missing only during his years in Iraq and a year in Japan with the Marine Corps. “It’s the most intense 12 minutes you’ll ever have. It’s a butt kicker; no matter what kind of shape you’re in going into it, it’ll kick your butt every time... but you always come back for more.” As time for sign up is getting close, 21-year-old Kieran Keaney, from Petaluma, shows up for the ax throw, looks over and decides, as a complete neophyte to the competition but not to log splitting, he’s going to enter. However, he’s in shorts and needs two teammates and a pair of jeans to compete. Pretty soon, not thwarted by size of the competitors or the depth of their experience, he’s got it together and ready to go with a pair of jeans, two more team members and equipment loaned from the Johnson family — Team Chainsaw. Hog Wild Farms enters bringing the total to four teams, the countdown begins and its two sets of competition, two teams per session. It is indeed a very intense 12 minutes. Final score: Trimble Construction 227, Johnson Quality Tree Care 184, Hog Wild Farms, 134; and Team Chainsaw 103.",

        "content": "As a tried and true drinker, I am not one for the seltzer world. However, when I was offered the chance to try High Noon's new Vodka Iced Tea line, I jumped at the opportunity. floats my boat, so I was ready to see if this top seltzer brand's hard tea was on par with my palate. High Noon's recently-launched four vodka iced tea flavors include Original, Lemon, Peach, and Raspberry. Each flavor is gluten free, only 90 calories, and 4.5% ABV. Made with real iced tea, real vodka, and no added sugar, I stood at attention, waiting for my package to arrive. I anticipated the flavor differences between your typical malt-based hard teas and this new twist with vodka, but I wasn't ready for what I found. Barbecues, beach days, concert tailgating -– this new addition to the High Noon family has all the makings for a great summer drink. Do these cans really have the \"spirit of summer in every sip?\" Let's find out. What does High Noon's Original Vodka Iced Tea taste like? It felt right to start this review with the OG — High Noon's Original Vodka Iced Tea. I have to say, I was blown away by the flavor! This option literally tasted like sweetened iced tea. There was a touch of alcohol in the aftertaste, but I couldn't tell it was vodka. For me, that's a huge win. However, I think my favorite part was the actual tea flavor. It really did taste like . With no sugar, I'm still trying to figure out how they made this hard drink so sweet. But the flavor wasn't cloying; just a touch of sugar to mellow out the black tea's bitter essence. These could be very dangerous on a hot summer's day. Needless to say, High Noon really pushed me to expand my tea-loving ways. The Original flavor was excellent, mimicking a with an alcoholic twist. I can't believe I'm saying this, but you might see me this summer with a High Noon in hand! What does High Noon's Lemon Vodka Iced Tea taste like? After trying the Original flavor, I had high hopes for High Noon's Lemon Vodka Iced Tea. I was anticipating a touch of acidity to an already stellar drink, but this one didn't really taste like lemon or iced tea at all. I could definitely pick out notes of lemon, but it reminded me more of the smell and taste of a flavored vodka. I had a few quick flashbacks to my younger years; think Bacardi. There wasn't a huge kick like you'd get with a shot of vodka, but it wasn't tea-tasting at all. There was no foundation of that signature black tea flavor like with the Original, leaving me a little confused when it came to this option. I guess if you like mixed drinks that lean lemon, you might like this one, but for me, this was a hard no. With no tea flavor and a vodka-leaning taste, I'll stick to what I know. What does High Noon's Peach Vodka Iced Tea taste like? After the lemon, I was a little nervous to try High Noon's Peach Vodka Iced Tea, but I have to say, this one surprised me. The peach scent was strong when I opened the can, and the taste followed suit, but it wasn't that artificial flavoring I was anticipating. No, this drink really tasted like it contained fresh peach juice. When it came to the tea base, I didn't really get the flavor until the aftertaste, where I got hints of black tea's bitter essence on the backend of the sip. There was a little alcohol flavor, as well, but it wasn't strong or overpowering. Overall, I'd call this one tea-adjacent. I didn't mind it, as it wasn't too sweet, but it didn't exactly taste like an iced tea. However, I'd still recommend it. The drink was crisp and refreshing — perfect for summer — but it wasn't for me. I want to taste the tea and feel like I'm on Grandma's porch on a 90-degree day. Peach was good, but it didn't impress. What does High Noon's Raspberry Vodka Iced Tea taste like? My last taste test in the lineup was the Raspberry Vodka Iced Tea flavor, and I have to say, I didn't love it. However, this one did taste like tea; you just have to appreciate and enjoy raspberry, which I've learned I don't. The main flavor in the profile was a strong and bold raspberry that leaned tart and a little artificial. But with that bold fruity flavor came black tea on the backend to help smooth out the acidic bite. If you like raspberry, you'll love this one, but I did get subtle hints of vodka, leaning more towards that over a true flavored iced tea. Was this one bad? Absolutely not, but it's definitely not for me. For those who love berry drinks, I do recommend High Noon's Raspberry Vodka Iced Tea, especially if you're a tea drinker — with or without alcohol. Our final thoughts on High Noon's vodka iced tea line High Noon's new vodka iced teas were a lot better than I expected. I love sugar and I dislike , so it's saying a lot that I found some real winners here. If I had to pick one, hands down, it's the Original. This is a solid tea drink and one I would reach for, especially since it has no sugar. This is a huge selling point for me — and for High Noon when you look at the other tea drinks on the market. It's the reason I have to be cautious when I reach for a hard tea option, but now, I don't have to worry one bit. Overall, I think this is a really great selection of hard iced teas –- all featuring their own unique flavor profiles. The brand truly created something for everyone in the tea world, and I definitely recommended giving them a try!",

        "content": "Mixed reactions have continued to trail the one year anniversary of President Bola Tinubu’s administration with knocks and praises by some Nigerians. Tinubu was inaugurated as the 16th President of Nigeria on May 29, 2023. Some residents of Okitipupa in Ondo State who spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday, commended Tinubu for his efforts at fixing the nation’s economy, while others said that he had failed Nigerians because of their high expectations from him. While calling on Tinubu to search for competent hands, the respondents urged him to rejig his for optimal performance. Mrs Morenike Alaka, a former Chairman, Okitipupa Local Government, told NAN that Tinubu was not the genesis of the current economic woes being experienced by Nigerians, saying it was an inherited problem. Alaka noted that it was not possible to fix the current situation of the country without effecting some policies that would be unfavourable to Nigerians in the short-term but would be beneficial in the long-term. “We just need to cooperate and continue to pray for this government, and I can assure you that what we are facing right now are just measures which is hard now but we will enjoy in the long run,” she said. Mr Niyi Adesokan, Chairman, Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE), Okitipupa Local Government Chapter, also said that Tinubu was only trying to fix the economy, adding that most of the problems being experienced “are only teething problems which shall vade out very soon.” He added that the immediate past government destroyed so many things “especially on borrowing which is literally having negative effects on the country and her currency. “On the issue of the local government autonomy, Tinubu has shown commitment to putting this in place in every local government with a view to ensuring development at the grassroots. Once the autonomy is given, you will see vast development from the grassroots,” he said. However, Dr Dipo Akomolafe, a former Chairman, Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) at the Olusegun Agagu University of Science and Technology (OAUSTECH), Okitipupa, said “the first one year of Tinubu’s administration has been a challenging one to individuals and the nation at large”. According to him, Nigerians are finding it extremely difficult to feed and shelter, while people can no longer afford the means of transportation. Akomolafe, who noted that the education sector was also adversely affected, said the health and welfare of staff of tertiary institutions were stagnated through inadequate budgetary allocation which, according to him, is hampering them from performing their core roles of research. He said that “though the country is truly blessed with abundant mineral resources, our focus all along has been oil; a gift that has significantly contributed to the economy of Nigeria as a whole. “In order to achieve development, it is imperative that we diversify and institutionalise foundational economic frameworks to fully reap the blessings of oil itself and focus on other resources and agriculture.” Also, Mr Larry Ogunmusire, a People’s Democratic Party stalwart, who described Tinubu’s one year administration as very challenging, noted that his economic policies brought more pains to Nigerians. He added that power and the defence sectors were badly hit as many Nigerians have not been enjoying eight hours electricity in the last one year, while many can no longer sleep with their two eyes closed for fear of being kidnapped. According to him, the subsidy removal by Tinubu during his inaugural speech, affects the economy leading to untold hardship in the country. “I think he needs to change his economic policies and rejig his cabinet, and replace non performing ministers with people of track records and high profiles who can help drive the economy,” Ogunmusire said. Also Mr Temidayo Temola, Chairman, Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Universities (SSANU), OAUSTECH Chapter, said that Tinubu’s government has not renewed the hope of Nigerians as encapsulated in his campaign manifesto. He said that in the last one year, the astronomical increase in prices of goods and services is not only frustrating but killing “as many of what the masses could afford are no longer affordable. “On the education sector, nothing has significantly improved as non payment of the withheld salaries of the university staff has remained a forlorn hope. “The president and his team have to sit right and find a lasting solution to the myriad of problems ranging from food, exchange rate, security, power and agriculture, among others, are resolved,” Temola said.

        "description": "One small step for man, one giant leap for bacon lovers everywhere. Here's how Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin ended up eating bacon during the moon landing.",
        "content": "When Apollo 11 landed on the moon on July 20, 1969, it was a momentous occasion. Upwards of 650 million people around the world sat in stunned silence and anticipation as two American astronauts took their first steps on Earth's satellite planet. When Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin went back to the lunar module after their initial exploration, it wouldn't have surprised anyone if they feasted on dehydrated surf and turf, with glasses of floating champagne in celebration, but it wasn't beef or lobster on their plates, it was bacon. Any bacon lover would agree that the salty, crunchy, porky, fatty food is completely appropriate for celebratory occasions (or any occasion, really), but the pork product likely wasn't chosen to be part of the astronauts' meal plan because they requested it. Rather, it traveled well in space. Figuring out which foods could be transported into and consumed in low-gravity conditions was just one large piece of the space travel puzzle for NASA scientists to figure out before Apollo 11. Foods had to meet weight and volume limits, stay safe and edible without refrigeration, not be overly crumbly (fine crumbs could affect equipment), and offer enough calories and nutrition for the astronauts. Bacon checked all the boxes, as did peaches, strawberry cubes, and grape and orange drinks, which rounded out the meal Armstrong and Aldrin dined on after their moonwalk. Space food had already come a long way By the time of the Apollo missions, scientists and astronauts had already been testing edibles in space during the prior Mercury and Gemini missions. Fast-forward to the 1969 moon landing, and the food wasn't bad, by comparison. During the Project Mercury flights, much of the food astronauts ate came in paste form, in toothpaste-like tubes. In April 1961, Soviet pilot and cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to fly to space, and he feasted on beef and liver paste in a tube. Yum. During the Gemini missions, cosmic culinary arts had improved, with an emphasis put on freeze-drying and dehydrating foods for space flights. The foods could be placed in packages in which water could be inserted for rehydration. During the Apollo years, the foods' packaging was similar to those during Gemini, but the variety was greater. Foods in the pilots' meal plans included cornflakes, scrambled eggs, hot dogs, spaghetti, tuna salad, and peanut butter. Coffee was also placed on the menu — and if you ask me, what could be better than coffee and bacon, with a view of planet Earth to go with it? Is bacon still on the microgravity menu? During Apollo 13, astronaut Jim Lovell reportedly told mission control, \"Happiness is bacon squares for breakfast.\" The appreciation for bacon is clearly out of this world, yet, someone, somewhere (likely a brainiac at NASA) decided bacon didn't need to be a food option for astronauts anymore. Although the food list has grown from fewer than 70 foods in the Apollo era to over 200 today, bacon is noticeably missing. The closest thing space travelers will find are sausage patties. Of course, one hardly becomes an astronaut for the food, and it's a good thing they don't have to squeeze meat paste from a tube anymore, but, seriously NASA, bacon can't take up that much room aboard, can it? Things are a bit different at the International Space Station, which has refrigeration and freezing capabilities. Here, visitors will find bacon and a large variety of meals, fresh fruits, desserts, dairy items, and snacks. Recommended",

        "content": "Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in the 2023 general elections, has explained what will make him consider a merger between the LP and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ahead of the 2023 general elections. Obi spoke in an interview on Noire TV-Global Black TV during the weekend. He also reacted to the possibility of being supported as a southeast candidate in the 2027 presidential election by Atiku Abubakar, which he said he appreciated. Obi said: “I commend him. And I’m grateful for his statements. Especially where he said he will support me if it (the presidential ticket) goes to the South-East.” The former Anambra State governor, however, noted that his primary concern is not personal ambition or political maneuvering, but rather the well-being of Nigeria and its people. “I’m not desperate to be president. I’m desperate to see Nigeria work, especially for the poor people because we have a lot of potential”, Obi said. On the potential merger between the PDP and LP, Obi said he is open to the idea, provided that the goal is to better govern Nigeria and unlock its vast potential. “If the merger is to be able to govern Nigeria properly, unlock all those things that will make Nigeria a better place, I’m for it,” he said, adding that he has no interest in mergers or alliances solely to secure power or win elections.

I don’t want to be part of anything like that,” he said. According to him, unity and cooperation among individuals and parties is a welcome development, only if the objective is to build a better Nigeria. Peter Obi said: “It might be at the party level, it might be at the individual level. Might be at any level. But we must come together to be able to build a better Nigeria.” Opinions Balanced, fearless journalism driven by data comes at huge financial costs.

        "content": "BURGER King is bringing back its $5 value meal in a bid to rival McDonald's. However, customers have concerns over the portion sizes. Burger King is set to unveil a $5 ‘Your Way Meal’ as fast food competitors wage a price war. As first reported by Bloomberg , the meal will include the customer's choice of one of three sandwiches, fries, chicken nuggets, and a drink. For the sandwich, the options will be a Whopper Jr, a Chicken Jr, or a Bacon Cheeseburger. \"We are bringing back our $5 Your Way Meal as agreed upon with our franchisees back in April,” the company said in a statement to USA TODAY. The promotion is expected to last a few months when it hits menus. While it's not yet known when the Your Way Meal will make its debut, Burger King execs have said they want it to beat the arrival of the $5 value meal at McDonald's on June 25. The $5 McDonald's meal will include a McChicken or McDouble, four-piece chicken McNuggets, medium fries, and a drink However, the promotion will only last a few weeks. McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said the chain is \"laser-focussed on affordability\" during a late April earnings call. It has suffered consumer backlash for the inflation of its menu prices over the last decade. Burger King has not made it clear what size the portions of fries, nuggets, and the drink will be in the $5 meal. This has led some customers to worry that the portions will be small. \"Let me guess -- a small fry and small drink,\" predicted one on Reddit . \"For only 25 cents less you can get a super small!\" joked another. One Burger King fan shared their hunger-busting solution. \"These are usually smaller portions but even then, if you're really hungry, for around $12 including taxes you can get two of these deals and get a total of eight items - not a bad deal at all. The U.S. Sun compared prices for a single cheeseburger at five different fast food chains in Chicago, Illinois: Other fast-food chains are also battling it out to offer the best value for diners. Wendy's has brought back its $3 breakfast combo . The chain is also giving away burgers for just one cent . Meanwhile, Buffalo Wild Wings has brought back its all-you-can-eat deal .",

        "content": "It was another impressive outing for 35-year-old left-hander Chris Sale . Sale (8-1), struck out eight while pitching seven innings of one-run ball. Sale has reformed his game that earned him seven consecutive All-Star selections from 2012-18 before injuries caught up to him. “Just doing what I need to do,” Sale said to The Canadian Press. “We all have our part on the team. Just posting every fifth day and trying to keep runs off the board. Take every start, you want to win. Had a couple of rough ones over the last couple of days. You want to end on a good note heading back home.” Ending on a good note, indeed. Sale has a 2.22 ERA in nine starts. He went into Sunday’s start at Pittsburgh on a six-game winning streak where he’s put up a 1.15 ERA with 50 strikeouts and only three walks in 39 innings. That success of late, according to JayHayKid, has Sale joining Fergie Jenkins (1971) as the only pitcher to ever go 7-0 with 50+ strikeouts and four or fewer walks over a seven-start span. Chris Sale joins Fergie Jenkins (1971) as the only pitchers ever to go 7-0 with 50+ K and 4 or fewer BB over a 7-start span. — nugget chef (@jayhaykid) May 27, 2024 Chris Sale Looks Like Himself Again Sale’s last healthy season goes back to 2017. He finished second in the American League Cy Young Award voting after going 17-8 with a 2.90 ERA and led the majors with 308 strikeouts and 214 1/3 innings in 32 starts. He might not able to replicate that season, but Sale has been one of the best surprising stories this season. “It’s even more so once you get to know the person, get to the competitor, get to know really what he’s all about,” Braves pitching coach Rick Kranitz said. “He threw the ball the other day and was unbelievably good. He came in and he’s saying, just between me and him, stuff like, ‘How ’bout those plays (Austin) Riley made?’ ‘How ’bout the catch that so-and-so made.’ You know what I mean? I said, ‘Well how ’bout the guy that struck out 10?’ “But it just shows, he’s very giving, he’s thoughtful to his teammates. He’s as good of a teammate, I think, as you will ever have.” First @Braves pitcher since 2003 to win seven consecutive starts. Chris Sale reached the mark in his first 10 outings for Atlanta. pic.twitter.com/w59UrpUjZ2 — Bally Sports: Braves (@BravesOnBally) May 26, 2024 Losing Spencer Strider to season-ending elbow surgery hurt the Braves. But, they are happy that Sale and Max Fried are getting the job done. Fried, who has a 2.01 ERA, has opposing hitters batting .162 in his past eight starts . Behind those two is Reynaldo López , who has a 1.75 ERA with a 2-2 record. It’s no secret that the pitching is carrying much more of the load than last year. For someone like Sale, he’s been important in that effort both on and off the field. “It’s great, because he has a lot of wisdom,” Krantz said. “Which really helps everybody. Young guys, the older guys. You put that on how hard he’s worked due to injuries, so he can offer that to our guys. You know, he’s at a different level than a lot of pitchers in this game. He’s been through a lot, he’s won a World Series, All-Star Games, and he’s still very humble.” This article first appeared on Last Word On Sports and was syndicated with permission.",

        "content": "is one of the biggest artists in the entire world, Overall, the same can be said of other massive artists like , , and . Well, according to , all of these artists were the over the weekend. In fact, one song in particular caught the attention of fans. This song is about eight years old and is called \"Can U Be.\" It is a collaboration between Kanye and Travis Scott, with the full song making the rounds on Twitter, Sunday evening. As per HHNM's reporting, there was a Group Buy that was started by someone on Discord. For those who are not familiar, a Group Buy is a group auction of sorts with a set goal. In this case, the goal was $25,000. If the goal was reached, then all of the music would get leaked to the group. Well, the goal was reached extremely fast. In fact, there were some people willing to donate thousands of dollars on an individual level. That is a lot of money, but leaks have always proven to be valuable. It was noted that among these leaks are actual stems, which means producers can do as they please with the tracks. Moreover, some of the songs that were leaked have already released, however, these are simply alternate versions. Needless to say, if you are a music nerd or a super fan, there is going to be a lot here for you to digest. However, we do not recommend engaging with leaks. If the artist wanted you to hear these songs, they would have released them by now. Let us know what you think about this leak, in the comments section down below. Do you believe that these kinds of leaks are immoral? What do you think music fans should do when confronted with these kinds of leaks? Ignore them? Or go ahead and listen? Additionally, stay tuned to for the latest news and updates from around the music world. We will always be sure to keep you informed on all of your favorite artists and their upcoming projects.

Mahamat in a recent post on X said, “With horrific overnight airstrikes killing mostly Palestinian women & children, the State of Israel continues to violate international law with impunity and in contempt of an International Court of Justice, ICJ, ruling two days ago ordering an end to its military action in Rafah. “The ICJ order must be urgently enforced if global order is to prevail.” Recalls that the ICJ, on Friday, ordered Israel to halt its Rafah offensive, and demanded the release of hostages and the provision of humanitarian aid to Gaza.

        "content": "Colombo: Sri Lankan security forces suspect that a 46-year-old man acted as a handler of the four Sri Lankan nationals who were arrested at Ahmedabad airport in India last week for suspected links with the banned Islamic State (ISIS) outfit, a media report said on Monday. Sri Lanka Police revealed that the wanted suspect, identified as Osmand Gerrard – a resident of Dematagoda, often changes his appearances, and these are some of his appearances that detectives suspect he may be using now, Newsfirst news portal reported. Sri Lanka Police recently announced a cash award of Rs. 2 million for any credible information on the whereabouts of the wanted suspect. The Gujarat Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) on May 19 arrested four Sri Lankans with links to the ISIS at the Sardar Vallabhai Patel airport in Ahmedabad. The ATS also seized three pistols and cartridges abandoned at a location in Ahmedabad based on geo-coordinates and seized a mobile phone from their possession. The four men had taken an Indigo flight out of Colombo to Chennai on May 19. Among the arrested individuals, Mohammed Nusrat is a businessman involved in importing telecommunication devices and electrical equipment from countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Dubai, the news portal said. Nusrat operated within Colombo, where he sold these imported goods. Mohammad Nafran, 27, who was also arrested, has been identified as the son of the first wife of Niyas Naufer aka ‘Potta Naufer’ the notorious underworld criminal who was sentenced to death for the killing of High Court Judge Sarath Ambepitiya. The other two Sri Lankans are 35-year-old Mohammad Faris from Maligawatte, Colombo and 43-year-old Mohammad Rashdeen from Colombo 13. Mohammad Faris had worked as a ‘Nattami’ or cart puller in Pettah, and was arrested by the Colombo Crimes Division on March 11, 2023, and November 1 of the same year. On May 21, his close associate Hameed Amir was arrested by the Terrorist Investigations Division. Mohammad Faris had left for Chennai, India on May 19. The other suspect is Mohammad Rashdeen, a three-wheeler driver. Security forces suspect that he is linked to trafficking crystal meth, or ICE. On September 16, 2022, Rashdeen was arrested by the Foreshore Police and was later released on bail. Last week, the Sri Lankan authorities launched a high-powered operation to investigate the four Sri Lankans arrested in Gujarat.",

        "content": "NEW DELHI: India's bowlers Yuzvendra Chahal and Avesh Khan departed to join the first group of the Men in Blue squad in New York ahead of the ICC T20 World Cup , which begins on June 1. Star spinner Chahal, who had an impressive IPL 2024 season with the Rajasthan Royals, taking 18 wickets, is part of the World Cup squad. Pacer Avesh Khan will accompany the team as a reserve player. At the Mumbai airport, Avesh was seen on a video call with fellow reserve player Rinku Singh . On Sunday, the first batch of Indian players, including skipper Rohit Sharma, pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, and top-ranked T20I batter Suryakumar Yadav, left for the United States. Among those spotted at the airport were head coach Rahul Dravid, batting coach Vikram Rathour, batter Shubman Gill, all-rounders Ravindra Jadeja and Shivam Dube, pacers Mohammed Siraj, Arshdeep Singh, and Khaleel Ahmed, along with spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel. Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sanju Samson, who recently ended their IPL campaign with Rajasthan Royals after a loss to Sunrisers Hyderabad, and Kolkata Knight Riders' batter Rinku Singh, along with star batter Virat Kohli, whose Royal Challengers Bangalore team lost to RR in the eliminator, have not joined the squad yet. India will kick off their T20 World Cup campaign on June 5 against Ireland at the newly constructed Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York. The much-anticipated clash between India and Pakistan is set for June 9. Following this, India will face co-hosts USA on June 12 and Canada on June 15 to conclude their Group A matches. India aims to end their ICC trophy drought, having last won the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013. Since then, they have reached the 50-over World Cup final in 2023, semifinals in 2015 and 2019, the ICC World Test Championship final in 2021 and 2023, the T20 WC final in 2014, and semifinals in 2016 and 2022, but have not secured a major ICC trophy. India will strive to win their first T20 World Cup title since their victory in the inaugural edition in 2007 in South Africa. In the last edition held in Australia in 2022, India lost to England by 10 wickets in the semifinals. India squad: Rohit Sharma (c), Hardik Pandya (vc), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant (wk), Sanju Samson (wk), Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohd.

Press and Journal photographer Jason Hedges captured the moment the heavens opened on camera. One moment it was a pleasant late spring day – the next Mother Nature did her best. The cloud formed over Elgin before it drifted eastwards bringing a huge downpour. Elgin started out on the Bank Holiday with sunshine between 7am and 10am, when the dark cloud appeared. The said the temperature at the time of the downfall was 15C, and the sun with showers had returned by about 1pm, with humidity rising to 83% by 3pm. On social media, Elgin folks reacted to the cloud and the downpour. One said it was like “the dementors of Harry Potter have arrived” while others wanted to get home in time to take in their washing on the drying line. are called altostratus and appear as grey or bluish-grey sheets of cloud that partially or cover the sky at mid-levels. Even though they cover the sky, you can typically still see the sun as a dimly lit disk behind them – as proved in Elgin earlier. But not enough sun to cast shadows on the ground. Altostratus clouds tend to form ahead of a warm or occluded front. But they can also occur together with cumulus at a cold front. A was issued for north and north-east as residents braced for 11 hours of rain. Residents in the north and north-east were warned of “slow-moving rain and thunderstorms in the area.”",

        "content": "Following a four-hour rain delay, the IndyCar blue ribband event boiled down to a dramatic showdown between Josef Newgarden and Pato O’Ward, with the Mexican taking the lead into Turn 1 on the 200th and final lap. But Team Penske's Newgarden wasn't finished and reclaimed the head with a daring outside move at Turn 3 before crossing the line to become the first back-to-back 500 winner since Helio Castroneves in 2002. In a race that saw a high rate of attrition, with Marcus Ericsson (2022), Will Power (2018) and Ryan Hunter-Reay (2014) among the previous winners embroiled in incidents, NASCAR Cup champion Kyle Larson finished 18th on his IndyCar race debut. Rain in Charlotte, where NASCAR was staging a 600-mile Cup race, thwarted his efforts to join the exclusive list of drivers that have contested both in the same day. IndyCar reporter Joey Barnes joins host Steph Wentworth on the podcast to discuss Newgarden's achievement, how O'Ward's Arrow McLaren machine used strategy and aggression to get back into contention, and whether Larson or Ed Carpenter Racing’s Christian Rasmussen should win Rookie of the Year honours.",

Mr. Soren had withdrawn his petition before the Supreme Court seeking interim bail and quashing of arrest in the case on May 22. Also read: Why did the Supreme Court not apply its Kejriwal bail precedent to Hemant Soren? | Explained A bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Satish Chandra Sharma had flagged that Mr. Soren had hidden the fact that a Jharkhand trial court had taken cognisance of the case against him way back on April 4. Ranchi Special PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) court had rejected the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leader’s bail petition in this case on May 13. In the fresh bail petition filed by Mr. Soren before the High Court, it is stated that the ED does not have a single document related to the 8.5 acres of land on which it has taken action against him alleging land-grabbing. It also stated that land under Jharkhand’s CNT (Chota Nagpur Tenancy) Act cannot be transferred to anyone in any circumstances. The date of hearing in this case has not been fixed yet.

        "content": "WASHINGTON — President Biden honored America’s fallen troops Monday at Arlington National Cemetery — saying in a Memorial Day speech that Americans must be “keepers of their mission” while reminiscing about his own son’s death from brain cancer . “Today, we’re not just fortunate heirs of their legacy, we have a responsibility to be the keepers of their mission — that truest memorial to their lives: the actions we take every day to ensure that our democracy endures,” the 81-year-old president said after laying a wreath at the military cemetery. Biden, whose son Beau died in 2015 , said that he understood the grief of families in attendance for the annual event, and noted the expansion of veteran health treatment under the PACT Act, which he signed in 2022. “I know it hurts. The hurt is still real, still raw. This week marks nine years since I lost my son, Beau,” Biden said. “Our losses are not the same. He didn’t perish on the battlefield. He was a cancer victim from a consequence of being in the Army in Iraq for a year next to a burn pit — a major in the US National Army, National Guard, living and working by too many besides that toxic burn pit,” he continued. “And as it is for so many of you, the pain of his loss is with me every day, as it is with you — still sharp, still clear, but so is the pride I feel in his service, as if I can still hear him saying, ‘It’s my duty, Dad, it’s my duty,'” he went on. “Duty, that was the code of my son live by and the creed all of you live by — the creed that generations of service members have followed into battle. On the grounds around us lie fallen heroes from every major conflict in history, to defend our independence, to preserve our union, to defeat fascism, to build powerful alliances, forged in the fires of two world wars.” Morning Report and Evening Update: Your source for today's top stories Please provide a valid email address.

Biden, who is preparing for a trip to Normandy next month to commemorate the US military’s role in the invasion of Nazi-occupied France, noted that American troops “80 years ago next week took to the beaches of Normandy and liberated a continent and literally saved the world.” “Decade after decade, tour after tour, these warriors fought for our freedom and the freedom of others, because freedom has never been guaranteed,” he said. “Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few and the rights of many.” Biden added that “our democracy is more than just a system of a government. It’s the very soul of America. It’s how we’ve been able to constantly adapt through the centuries.”",

        "description": "Google's Find My Device app on Android is getting updated with a new feature to simplify login process. The upgraded version includes biometric unlocks and Remote Lock functionality via Google Play Services.",
        "content": "Google ’s Find My Device app on Android is set to get updated with a new feature that will help users to login to the app more easily. The tech giant has already started rolling out the upgraded version of the Find My Device network for some Android users. Android trackers that will use this network and compete with Apple’s AirTags which users will be able to manage through the app are also expected to arrive soon. Currently, the Find My Device app needs users to enter their account password every time they open it. However, this frequent account password requirements slows down the Find My Device app’s sign-in process which may become annoying for some users. Google is reportedly exploring other ways of making the process easier, and biometric unlocks may help the company solve the issue. According to a report by Android Authority, a tipster named Assemble Debug managed to enable a biometric login option for the updated Find My Device app. The report also noted that the tipster was also able to enable the remote lock functionality within the latest Google Play Services . Find My Device has allowed users to lock and erase their phones for years now. However, the new Remote Lock functionality will allow users to lock their device with just their phone number and a quick security challenge using any device. The report noted that even though the feature was activated it didn’t work, as the rollout of the same is expected in the coming says. Yet, the report shared a screenshot of the feature. The new Remote Lock feature is expected to reduce people’s worries when they lose their device and realise that they do not immediately remember their account details. Remote Lock will be available to Android 10 and above devices through a Google Play Services update later in the year, the report noted. As per the report, both these feature are currently live within the app as Google is testing them and may release them for the public sometime soon.",

        "content": "NBA legend and Hall of Famer Bill Walton died Monday at 71 years old. The NBA announced his death and noted he was \"surrounded by family\" after \"a prolonged battle with cancer.\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver released a statement that said, in part, \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind ... What I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events—always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" Before he was a champion at the NBA level, Walton was one of the best men's college basketball players in the sport's history. He attended powerhouse UCLA and played three seasons from 1971 to 1974 while building a resume that included two national championships, three Naismith Awards, two Associated Press Player of the Year awards and three consensus All-American selections. Walton was a transcendent collegiate star, and the Portland Trail Blazers jumped at the chance to select him with the No. 1 overall pick of the 1974 NBA draft. It is hard to script a better start to a career than the one Walton enjoyed, as he led the Trail Blazers to their only championship in franchise history in just his third season. As if that wasn't enough, he was the league MVP in his fourth year after finishing second in voting in that third season. Walton led the league in rebounding and blocks during that championship season in 1976-77 and then won NBA Finals MVP while averaging 18.5 points, 19.0 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 3.7 blocks and 1.0 steals per game in the victory over Julius Erving's Philadelphia 76ers. He seemed well on his way to a long and legendary career, but foot injuries undercut much of his peak following that incredible run in Portland. As a result, he missed the 1978-79, 1980-81 and 1981-82 seasons while playing just 14 games in 1979-80 and 33 games in 1982-83 for the San Diego Clippers. To Walton's credit, he carved out a second act of his NBA career as a bench presence for the Boston Celtics. He took home the Sixth Man of the Year in 1985-86 for a Celtics team that won the championship and is largely remembered as one of the best in NBA history. He played just 10 games after that season but was still elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993 and named a member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team following his career. That career alone would have made him a forever memorable figure in the basketball world, but he later became one of the voices of the sport for a generation that was not old enough to have watched him play. Walton became an NBA and college basketball analyst for NBC, CBS, ABC and ESPN. His eccentric approach and catchphrases captured the audience's attention and never failed to amuse even when the games themselves weren't thrilling or close. He won a Sports Emmy in 1991 and was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all-time by the American Sportscaster Association in 2009. Some will remember Walton as one of college basketball's best all-time players, some will remember him as a champion and MVP for the Trail Blazers, some will remember him for his supporting role on Larry Bird's Celtics, and others will remember him as a broadcaster who seemed to enjoy every moment on air. He is one of basketball's most enduring figures, and he is survived by his wife and four children.",

        "content": "CHELSEA are on the verge of making Enzo Maresca their new boss. Todd Boehly and the Chelsea ownership group identified the 44-year-old Leicester City head coach as the man they want to replace Mauricio Pochettino. And they have been granted permission by Leicester City to speak to the Italian who led the Foxes to Championship glory and promotion back to the Prem in his debut season at the King Power. Chelsea's co-Sporting Directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart will jet into Marbella for face-to-face talks with Maresca in the next 24 hours. That suggests Chelsea have triggered the £9million release clause in Maresca's three-year-contract with the Foxes. Chelsea are confident a three-year-deal will be agreed swiftly with Maresca understandably keen to move to Stamford Bridge. Maresca's appointment will complete a meteoric rise for the 44-year-old Italian who has emerged ahead of Roberto De Zerbi , Kieran McKenna , Thomas Frank and Thomas Tuchel to become Chelsea's top target. Maresca's first managerial role was a short-lived one as he only lasted 14 games at fallen Italian giants Parma in the summer of 2021 before he was dismissed by the Serie B club. However he returned to City, where he had enjoyed success as manager of their elite development squad, to become Pep Guardiola 's first team assistant coach in the summer of 2022. A year later, after celebrating a historic treble, including Champions League success with City, Maresca was on the move again to newly-relegated Leicester City. CASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS There he lived up to his reputation as one of Pep Guardiola's disciples - in common with Mikel Arteta and Vincent Kompany - by playing a patient, possession-based style of football similar to City's blueprint. That made him unpopular at times with fickle Foxes fans, who preferred a much more direct approach. However, despite a few bumps along the road, Maresca led Leicester back to the Premier League at the first attempt and lifted the Championship trophy too. It is Marseca's sometimes stubborn, painstaking attention to detail and his tactical nous which has attracted him to Blues chiefs. Leicester City's former Spurs midfielder Harry Winks described Maresca as the best head coach he'd ever worked with - even though he had previously played for Pochettino, Antonio Conte and Jose Mourinho in his Spurs days. Enzo Maresca is considered among the most exciting young coaches on the planet. Born in Italy in 1980, he managed to guide Leicester to the Championship title in his first season as Foxes boss. His management career started at Italian minnows Ascoli before he was snapped up by Man City in 2020 to manage their Elite Development Squad. He guided the youth team to the Premier League 2 title in his one season working for the Citizens - with Cole Palmer in the side. His first senior job was with Parma but he was sacked after just a few months after failing to impress. Despite the team playing in Serie B and Maresca having an impressive squad he was unable to get them on course for promotion. He returned to Man City and worked as one of Pep Guardiola's assistants for the 2022/23 season as they won the Treble. He took over relegated Leicester last summer and made an immediate impact, with the Foxes winning the Championship title. Maresca showed his dedication to the job by living at the training ground for the first two months after his appointment. He's considered something of a Pep disciple and has said: \"For a coach, it’s important to have the mentality of a chess player.\" During his playing career he played under Carlo Ancelotti and Marcello Lippi - and alongside ex-Brighton boss Roberto de Zerbi. And Chelsea were staggered by Maresca's knowledge of their own youthful squad as well as his single-minded determination over the brand of football he intends to bring to Stamford Bridge. While many managers may see the Chelsea job as something of a poisoned chalice, Maresca can't wait to work with their vast squad of expensive, quality kids and convince them of his methods. SunSport understands the Italian would have faced financial hardship and an expected points deduction at Leicester City and feels the Foxes didn't reveal the true extent of their financial situation to him. However, with no practical experience of managing in the Premier League, Maresca may have to win Chelsea fans over quickly - as he clearly has already done with their Board.",

At a WHO meeting in Geneva, India showcased its health journey and emphasized digital healthcare's role, transitioning from CoWIN to UWIN for immunization tracking. Chandra introduced BHISM cube, aiding up to 200 casualties. Discussions included vaccination cooperation, pandemic recovery, and mental health focus.",
        "content": "NEW DELHI: India recognised as the pharmaceutical capital of the world, is bolstering the SEARO region with affordable medical countermeasures, according to Union Health cretary Apurva Chandra. Chandra chaired a high-level meeting titled \"Advancing Health and Well-Being of Billions in WHO South-East Asia Region \" in Geneva on Monday. The event, a side-session of the 77th World Health Assembly, was co-hosted by the WHO Regional Office for Southeast Asia (SEARO) and the Indian government. The focus was to devise strategic actions for addressing key public health issues in the Southeast Asia region, according to a statement by the Health Ministry. The meeting began with a video presentation on India's health journey, highlighting the four pillars of the Pradhan Mantri Ayushman Bharat Mission, which aims to provide universal health coverage to all citizens in India. In his address, Chandra emphasised the critical role of digital technologies in India's healthcare landscape, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. He highlighted the transition from CoWIN to UWIN, a digital platform designed for tracking immunisations and creating digital certificates for every child. \"India, as the pharmaceutical capital of the world, is providing strength to the SEARO region through affordable medical solutions,\" Chandra stated, underscoring India's contribution to the region's healthcare infrastructure. Chandra also introduced the BHISM cube, an innovative product from India's Aarogya Maitri Project.

        "content": "by: Cameron Kiszla Posted: May 27, 2024 / 10:23 AM PDT Updated: May 27, 2024 / 11:11 AM PDT UCLA great and NBA Hall of Famer Bill Walton has died at the age of 71, the NBA announced Monday. The accomplished center died of cancer, according to ESPN NBA insider Adrian Wojnarowski , who cited the league as his source. In a statement, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver called Walton “truly one of a kind,” citing his impact both on the court and in the broadcast booth, “where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans.” “But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” ESPN college basketball announcer Bill Walton poses for a photo during a college basketball game between the Syracuse Orange and the Gonzaga Bulldogs on day two of the Allstate Maui Invitational at the SimpliFi Arena at Stan Sheriff Center on Nov. 21, 2023, in Honolulu, Hawaii.

(Mansoor Ahmed/Getty Images) Bill Walton during recording session for upcoming video game, Sept. 2, 2001 in San Diego, California. (Getty Images/Bob Riha, Jr.) Walton starred at UCLA under legendary coach John Wooden. The pair won national championships in 1972 and 1973, and Walton was thrice the national college player of the year. “A true Bruin legend that will forever be missed,” UCLA Athletics wrote on X, formerly Twitter . “We send our condolences to the Walton family.” Current UCLA coach Mick Cronin added that “it’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball.” “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality,” Cronin said in a news release . “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories, and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind, and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him. Our athletics department, our team and this university will miss him dearly.” In the professional ranks, he played for the Portland Trail Blazers, the San Diego and Los Angeles Clippers, and the Boston Celtics. He was a two-time NBA champion and winner of the league’s Most Valuable Player award in 1978. Aside from his time on the court, Walton, a native of La Mesa in San Diego County, was known for his love of jam bands, particularly the Grateful Dead, and was often sporting a tie-dyed or Hawaiian shirt while broadcasting basketball games. Despite what the NBA called “a prolonged battle with cancer,” Walton was spotted at this year’s NBA All-Star Game with a smile on his face. Walton is survived by his wife, Lori, and four sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris, all four of whom played college basketball. In addition, Luke Walton played for and coached the Los Angeles Lakers, among other teams, and was an assistant coach for the Cleveland Cavaliers this past season. Adam Walton is also a basketball coach, serving as an assistant for San Diego Mesa College. Submit Δ Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

        "content": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden marked Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation's fallen toward creating a more perfect union, \"for which they lived, and for which they died for.\" Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden said each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country's service members is not in vain. “Freedom has never been guaranteed,” Biden said under gray skies in the memorial amphitheater. “Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” He added: “On this day, we came together again to reflect, to remember, and above all, to recommit to the future they fought for, a future grounded in freedom, democracy, opportunity and equality. Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits, to highlight the importance of honoring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. “Last year, the VA delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever in our history,\" Biden said, crediting the PACT Act which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned, not anymore.” Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans, and Gold Star family members.",

        "content": "If you want to upgrade your bedroom on the cheap, here's an offer that'll grab your attention – all sizes of the Lucid Memory Foam Mattress are 30% off at Lucid Sleep , dropping the price of a queen to as low as $244.99. That's a hefty discount on an already affordable bed. The price alone is enough for anyone to do a double take, but get this: it's available in three firmness levels (plush, medium, and firm) and three heights (10”, 12”, and 14”). It's as customizable as the Saatva Classic, which we consider the best mattress overall – although Lucid offers an additional height option. A couple of things to keep in mind if you decide to explore this Memorial Day mattress sale further. First, the discount doesn't show up automatically – you’ll need to add the mattress to your cart to see the sale price. Also, some size and firmness options are unavailable, as this mattress is (understandably) selling out fast. Lucid Memory Foam Mattress at Lucid Sleep Was: From $249.99 Now: From $174.99 Saving: Up to $132 after in-cart discount Summary: The Lucid Memory Foam Mattress contains a gel memory foam layer, a support foam layer, a bamboo charcoal base foam layer, and a soft, breathable cover. These components work together to align your spine, relieve pressure points, and keep you cool throughout the night. There are three height and firmness levels to choose from, with taller beds costing more. For most adults, we recommend sticking to the 12\" or 14\" heights; the 10\" height is a good choice for a child or smaller adult. We haven't tested this mattress ourselves yet, but Lucid customers like it. It has a 4.5/5 rating with overwhelming praise for its value for money. Price history: If you're looking for an affordable mattress for a guest room or already shopping for a mattress for college , this deal is it. The Lucid Memory Foam Mattress is the brand's cheapest option. The starting price above is for a 10\" twin XL, but we recommend going taller if possible. (A 12\" queen is just $314.99 after discount.) Note that some selections are selling out quickly, namely the 10\" mattresses. Also, you can save more by purchasing multiples, with up to an extra 10% off if you buy three or more mattresses. (Have a vacation home you need to renovate?)

        "description": "HARARE – Bennedict Peters, a prominent Nigerian oil and gas billionaire, once heralded as a [...]",
        "content": "Bennedict Peters, a prominent Nigerian oil and gas billionaire, once heralded as a major investor in Zimbabwe’s mining sector, faces the potential loss of his lucrative mineral concessions due to stalled projects and financial difficulties. Peters, who amassed concessions for platinum, gold, lithium, iron ore, tin, and rare earth minerals with the support of Zimbabwean authorities, initially appeared set to become the first black investor to own significant mining assets in the country. However, his ambitious plans, including a flagship platinum mining project in Ngezi and a highly sought-after lithium dump in Kamativi, have encountered significant hurdles. Despite his initial reputation and promises to invest over US$1 billion in Zimbabwe, Peters’ projects have not progressed as expected. The Kamativi lithium dump, a joint venture with the government, is now at risk of being taken over by the authorities if tangible progress is not made soon. “Authorities are looking into the status of Peters’ projects in Ngezi, Kamativi, and other locations,” a senior Ministry of Mines official said. “There is concern about the slow pace and stalling of these projects. The situation is under scrutiny.” Reports indicate that civil works had started at the Kamativi project, including exploration, surveys, and sampling. However, progress has been slow, leading to government dissatisfaction. Sources reveal that Peters’ financial troubles in Ghana, where his company Aiteo Eastern E&P Company Limited is embroiled in a debt crisis, are affecting his Zimbabwean investments. The Nigerian energy company owes approximately US$2.6 billion in oil-related loans, complicating Peters’ ability to fund his mining projects in Zimbabwe. Peters’ Bravura has a 60% stake in the Kamativi lithium project, but the lack of substantial progress has led officials to consider alternative strategies, including inviting other investors, with Chinese partners being preferred. Government officials have expressed disappointment over the lack of progress, noting that Peters’ promises to invest over US$1 billion into various minerals, including the Kamativi lithium dump, have not been fulfilled. Despite claims of ongoing processes, such as mineralogical and metallurgical testing, visible development remains minimal. In contrast to Peters’ stalled projects, other mining investments in the region, such as Tharisa Plc’s Karo Mining Holdings, are making significant strides. The Karo platinum project, located on Zimbabwe’s Great Dyke belt, is seen as a world-class asset, contributing positively to the local economy and infrastructure. Peters’ inability to advance his projects has led to comparisons with the successful Karo project, further highlighting the issues with his investments. Despite initial enthusiasm and support from President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who launched Peters’ US$1 billion platinum deal, the projects have not met expectations. The Zimbabwean government is now considering repossessing Peters’ concessions and reallocating them to more capable investors. Officials argue that the valuable Kamativi lithium dump, worth billions of dollars, should be managed by investors who can deliver on their promises. Amid these challenges, Peters and his representatives maintain that progress is being made. However, the slow pace and financial instability cast doubt on the future of his Zimbabwean mining ventures. The potential repossession of Peters’ concessions underscores the government’s commitment to ensuring that mining projects contribute meaningfully to Zimbabwe’s Vision 2030 strategy and the broader economic development goals. As the situation unfolds, the focus will be on securing reliable and financially stable partners to harness the country’s rich mineral resources.",

        "content": "NEW YORK -- Two-time NBA champion and NBA Hall of Famer Bill Walton has passed away following a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA announced on Monday. Walton was surrounded by his family, according to the statement. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career - disrupted by chronic foot injuries - lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. \"One of my guards said, 'Let's try something else,\" Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden's response during that timeout: \"Why? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. \"It's very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA's program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. \"As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It's hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.\" The first overall pick of the 1974 NBA draft by the Portland Trail Blazers, the 6-foot-11 Walton played 10 seasons in the NBA, winning championships with the Blazers (1977) and the Boston Celtics (1986). He averaged a double-double over his career, totaling 6,215 points (13.3 per game), 4,923 rebounds (10.5 per game), 1,034 blocks (2.2 per game) and 1,590 assists. A two-time All-Star, he led the NBA in rebounding and blocks in 1977 and was the league's Sixth Man of the Year in 1986. After his NBA career, Walton turned to broadcasting where he entertained generations of basketball fans. Walton originally joined ESPN in 2002 as a lead analyst for NBA games before shifting to college basketball in 2012. He was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all-time by the American Sportscasters Association in 2009.. \"But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life,\" Silver said. \"He was a regular presence at league events - always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" --- Information from the NBA, ESPN and the Associated Press",

        "content": "LOTTERY players have been advised to double-check their tickets as a life-altering prize pot remains unclaimed. The Powerball win is worth $2 million, and the clock is ticking to come forward before the money vanishes. It was won by an unidentified Connecticut resident who purchased a ticket for the May 25 drawing, according to what lottery officials told CTPost . The slip was also confirmed to have been purchased at Krauzer's Food Store, a local convenience retailer, in Guilford, about 16 miles east of New Haven. The winner matched five numbers in the drawing of 19-28-39-42-57 and missed the Powerball. While this prize would typically be $1 million, the player chose the Power Play option, doubling the win to $2 million. If they'd matched the Powerball, the unknown winner could've taken home an estimated jackpot of over $121 million. The minimum jackpot amount is set at $20 million. Winners in Connecticut are given a 180-day window to come forward and claim their cash after the drawing release date, per the CT Lottery website . That means the player should have until November 21, 2024, to get the funds. They also must head to CT Lottery headquarters in Rocky Hill to claim their win, as with all prizes over $50,000. If the player never comes forward, the funds will be disbursed back into the state's General Fund for \"public health, libraries, public safety, education\" and other resources. It can also be re-circulated into additional lottery games or promotions. If the player does come forward in time, they also won't take home the entire $2 million depending on a crucial and controversial decision. Players are always given the option to receive the money in the form of a lump sum distribution or annuity payments. Annuity payments are sent out from the prize pot annually in smaller amounts throughout about 10 to 20 years. Players who win big on lottery tickets typically have a choice to make: lump sum or annuity? The two payout methods can impact how much money you get from your prize. Annuities pay out slowly in increments, often over 30 years. Lump sums pay all at once but in a smaller amount, as taxes are withheld in one go. That means 24% of your prize goes to Uncle Sam right away. Many states tax winnings as well. Annuities can provide winners time to set up the financial infrastructure required to take in a life-changing amount of money, but lump sums have the benefit of being taxed only once. Inflation is also worth considering when making a choice, as payouts do not adjust with the value of a dollar. That means that you'll likely be getting less valuable money towards the end of an annuity. Each state and game pays out prizes differently, so it’s best to check with your state’s lottery to confirm payment policies. A financial advisor can also help you weigh the pros and cons of each option. Experts have varying opinions on whether to take the lump sum or take the annuity . It allows the player to achieve a sense of financial security with consistent payments and less tax on the cash. Alternatively, if they choose the lump sum option, they get all the money at once for whatever they choose — investments , savings, spending, paying off debt — but they pay a significant amount of tax upfront. The federal government always takes a 24% cut from lottery winnings over $5,000. States are allowed to implement their tax rate on prize pots that usually coincide with income tax, and some don't have any. Connecticut's tax rate is set at 6.99%. In total, the player would forfeit about $619,800 to federal and state taxes from the $2 million Powerball win on May 25. They'd still walk away with approximately $1.38 million and they'd never have to pay taxes on the cash again — not a bad deal . Other players found themselves in a similar spot recently. A winner in Florida saw $180,000 vanish from their $1 million scratch-off ticket after electing the lump sum distribution. A player in Virginia, however, managed to avoid taxes on their $1 million win for a crucial reason.",

        "content": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Georgian Bay, in Ontario, is home to a groundbreaking initiative where researchers are turning ... [+] inhospitable rock barrens into thriving nurseries for endangered turtles, dramatically increasing their chances of survival. In Ontario, there are eight species of turtles, all of which are considered at risk to some degree. These species include the Blanding’s turtle, spotted turtle and snapping turtle, among others. The primary threats to these turtles come from habitat loss and fragmentation, particularly due to urbanization. Turtles are increasingly forced to navigate through hostile environments, crossing roads and developed areas, which often results in high mortality rates. Georgian Bay, often referred to as the sixth Great Lake, offers a stunning vista of the rugged Canadian Shield, hundreds of islands and clear blue waters. This expansive bay is, aside from being a jewel in Ontario’s natural landscape, also one of the last bastions of relative safety for the province’s endangered turtles. Georgian Bay is a stunning expanse of clear waters and rugged islands, serving as both a natural ... [+] fortress and a critical habitat for some of Ontario's at-risk turtles. While that may be the case today, a group of researchers from the University of Waterloo has recognized the critical need for direct intervention in the preservation of turtle populations in Georgian Bay and, by extension, in Ontario. Since 2019, they have been actively developing and testing their innovative habitat designs in the region. Recently, the team has published their findings in the journal Restoration Ecology . Here’s what you need to know. Human Nest Designs Can Significantly Boost Turtle Population Turtles often travel long distances to find suitable nesting sites, which ideally are sandy or soft-soiled areas where they can lay their eggs safely away from water predators but near enough to ensure the hatchlings’ safe passage to water. Apple Brings Back iPhone 14 Pro For First Time At Lower Price Refurbished The Birkenstock Memorial Day Sale Features Styles For Over 50% Off The 82 Best Memorial Day Sales To Shop Now Before They re Gone A tiny guardian of the future, this snapping turtle hatchling rests on the bank of a waterway, no ... [+] bigger than a half-dollar. Mother turtles face the crucial task of wisely choosing their nesting sites—far enough to escape water predators but close enough for hatchlings to safely reach the sanctuary of the water. Recognizing the severe limitations of the rocky terrain in Georgian Bay, researchers have engineered new nesting habitats that imitate the natural conditions turtles seek but rarely find in this landscape. These habitats are crafted from local materials like moss and lichen, known for their ability to retain moisture and provide a stable temperature—key factors for egg incubation. The researchers also carefully selected locations that, in addition to emulating ideal natural conditions, are strategically placed to reduce the need for long, perilous journeys by the turtles. This reduces the risk of road mortality and predation, significantly increasing the chances of survival for both the eggs and the mother turtles. The results from this five-year long initiative speak for themselves. In natural settings around Georgian Bay, where rocky and less hospitable terrains dominate, the probability of turtle eggs successfully hatching has historically been as low as 10%. However, with the introduction of these specially designed habitats, that number has soared to an impressive 41%. There’s More Good News In addition to improving overall hatching rates, the innovative habitats designed by the researchers also play a crucial role in addressing another subtle but significant challenge in turtle conservation: the temperature-dependent sex determination of hatchlings. In many turtle species, the temperature at which eggs are incubated will determine the sex of the turtle; warmer temperatures typically result in female hatchlings, while cooler temperatures tend to produce males. The moss and lichen used in constructing these new habitats have a natural ability to regulate temperature, often creating a warmer microenvironment compared to the surrounding rocky terrain. This slight increase in nest temperature has been shown to skew the sex ratio towards more female hatchlings. In areas like Georgian Bay, where the preservation and propagation of turtle populations are critical, having a higher proportion of females can significantly enhance the recovery and stability of these endangered species. Moreover, the use of such natural materials ensures that the environmental impact of the nesting sites is minimized. These materials are not only abundant in the Canadian Shield but also decompose naturally, leaving no permanent footprint on the landscape. This approach aligns with the principles of ecological conservation, where interventions should enhance, not harm, the existing environment. This pioneering conservation initiative in Georgian Bay demonstrates a successful model that can be replicated in similar rocky terrains across Canada, the United States and beyond. The takeaway is that as our need for urbanization grows, we need to be aware of the damage it causes to other species. Through ingenuity, research and technology, we can enhance habitats for other species, promoting coexistence and harmony with nature. Editorial Standards Print Reprints & Permissions",

The 30-year-old fast bowler made an encouraging return to competitive cricket, taking 2-34, in the second match of Pakistan's warm-up series against T20 world champions England in Birmingham on Saturday.",
        "content": "NEW DELHI: Pakistan speedster Haris Rauf is optimistic that his three-month absence from cricket due to a shoulder dislocation might turn out to be advantageous as he prepares for the upcoming T20 World Cup . In his comeback match, the second game of Pakistan's preparatory series against England, the reigning T20 world champions, in Birmingham on Saturday, the 30-year-old pacer displayed a promising performance, claiming a couple of wickets. \"I was injured the last few months but if you believe in yourself, then the layoff can be a blessing in disguise,\" he told a pre-match press conference in Cardiff on Monday ahead of the third T20. \"Because you have time to recover and reassess your game-plans. I felt good coming back to cricket. When you play for your country, it makes you very proud.\" As for the mental and physical strain of returning from injury for a fast bowler, Rauf said: \"It's hard. It's a struggle during your rehab, and it's difficult when you come back to maintain that pace and accuracy. But if you believe in yourself, it makes things easier. When I wasn't in the team and rehabbing, I had a lot of time to think about my game and work on myself. \"Thankfully I'm back now, and the World Cup is coming up.\" Rauf's return at Edgbaston could not prevent Pakistan suffering a 23-run defeat by England as they fell 1-0 behind in the four-match series with two to play following a washed-out opener. But Rauf insisted Pakistan, the 2009 T20 world champions, remained in optimistic mood ahead of their opening match at this year's global showpiece against co-hosts the United States in Dallas on June 6. \"When you lose a game it hurts, but as a team, we are confident,\" he said. \"We feel we can beat any opposition on any day. We've done it in the past, too. When you make mistakes you learn and try not to repeat those mistakes. We're looking to play better in the next few games and make a comeback. \"The camp is relaxed. We're enjoying ourselves. We're trying to follow our game-plans and execute them well. The results haven't often been in our favour recently but if you stick to your plans they can sometimes follow.\"",

        "description": "Squeaks, an Israeli Persian cat, fully recovered from an infection resistant to antibiotics by veterinarians who used personalized phage therapy.",
        "content": "Antibiotics are still the first line of treatment for infections in , but as these drugs are overused, many bacteria become resistant to them. Now, for the first time, an Israeli Persian cat has undergone personalized bacteriophage therapy that uses its genetic profile to guide decisions made for , diagnosis, and treatment. Bacteriophages (“phages” for short) are natural viruses that can selectively target and kill bacteria. They are considered to have a high therapeutic potential for the treatment of severe bacterial infections, especially those that cannot be treated with antibiotics. The therapy is personalized because the specific phages used are tailored to the individual patient's infection, as determined through bacterial culture and . In 2010, the first report of a veterinary clinical trial of a phage-based infection treatment was published. Ten dogs with chronic ear infections were treated with a cocktail of six phages active against the . The technique has also been used in cows, chickens, and other farm animals. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of general phage therapy in the food industry, largely in the dairy and meat industry, to combat bacterial growth. But this was only a general—not personalized—treatment that did not involve tailoring the phage to the animals’ genetic profile, so it was not very successful. A new study led by Prof. Ronen Hazan and his team from the Faculty of Dental Medicine at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HUJI), in collaboration with the team of Vet Holim – the Veterinary Medical Center in Kiryat Anavim just outside Jerusalem – has achieved a significant advancement in the treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections in animals. Interestingly, unlike common situations, this case was performed on an animal based on doctors’ insights from treating humans first. The team just published their innovative therapy in the journal Veterinary Quarterly under the title “Successful phage-antibiotic therapy of implant-associated infection in a Siamese cat.” The team included Ron Braunstein, Goran Hubanic, Ortal Yerushalmy, Sivan Oren-Alkalay, Amit Rimon, and Shunit Coppenhagen-Glazer. Their treatment involved a five-year-old Siamese cat named Squeaks who suffered from an infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria (that infects humans as well as canines) after undergoing arthrodesis surgery on a damaged joint cartilage to fuse two leg bones together. After the surgery, the area of bone where the joint was positioned is no longer capable of motion, and the pet is relieved of severe pain. Squeaks, initially treated at the Kiryat Anavim veterinary hospital for injuries sustained from a high-rise fall, developed a severe infection in the right hind leg following multiple operations. This infection persisted despite various antibiotic treatments over four months. Facing a potential implant-replacement surgery, the team turned to the new treatment which involved a meticulously designed combination of a specific anti- phage, a virus that kills bacteria, applied topically to the surgical wound, with ceftazidime (an injected, broad-spectrum third-generation cephalosporin beta-lactam antibiotic) administered with a needle into the muscle. After receiving instructions, the cat’s owners gave Squeaks most of the treatment doses of phages and antibiotics at their home. The integration of phage therapy with antibiotics was aimed at targeting the pathogen effectively and directly at the site of infection, leveraging the phage’s ability to be applied topically, which simplifies administration and maximizes its concentration at the infection site. This approach allowed the surgical wound, which had remained open for five months, to fully heal after 14 weeks of treatment. The successful outcome of this case underscores the critical need for novel therapeutics like personalized phage therapy to cope with the growing concern of antibiotic-resistant infections that affect up to 8.5% of surgical sites following orthopedic surgeries in pets. These infections pose significant health risks to the animals and increase the suffering, deaths, and costs involved in these procedures. Recent studies suggest that phage therapy, already showing high success rates in human medicine for treating orthopedic infections and chronically infected wounds, can offer a promising solution for similar issues in veterinary practice. Moreover, the successful treatment of this cat by its owners at home highlights the practicality and efficacy of personalized phage therapy, which could be extended to treat other pets facing similar antimicrobial resistance challenges, the authors wrote. The positive reception from veterinarians and pet owners regarding phage therapy indicates growing awareness and acceptance of this treatment option. “As the new treatment continues to be explored in veterinary settings, it not only improves the health and well-being of pets but also offers valuable data that contribute to the broader application of phage therapy in both animals and humans,” they continued. This bridging of data can enhance treatment protocols and outcomes across various bacterial infections, potentially changing the landscape of infection treatment in both veterinary and human medicine.” Braunstein told that the vet hospital treated Squeaky for free because it was the first case and that the team is ready to accept any pet—even a snake, dog, gerbil, rabbit, or others—for treatment if it suffers from a persistent bacterial infection that is not healing after being treated with antibiotics.",

        "description": "As attacks kill yet more civilians in Rafah, students at their allies at UofT say they will not stop pressuring the university to divest from Israel.The post Ontario Federation of Labour rallies with students at UofT encampment appeared first on rabble.ca.",
        "content": "The leadership of the Ontario Federation of Labour (OFL) held an emergency rally on Monday morning, May 27 on the University of Toronto (UofT) campus. The rally was in solidarity with students and their supporters who for three weeks have set up camp on the university grounds to call for their school’s disclosure of, and divestment from, investments in Israel. UofT president Meric Gertler announced in a statement on Monday that lawyers for the university were seeking an injunction from Ontario Superior Court to have the encampment removed. This comes after the protesters were served with a trespass notice by the Toronto Police Service (TPS) late last week with a deadline to vacate the campus by Monday morning. “In addition to pursuing this legal avenue to return King’s College Circle to the University community, we continue to engage in discussions with students representing those in the encampment,” reads Gertler’s statement. “We held a long and productive meeting yesterday and are meeting again today. We remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement and bring the unauthorized encampment to an end.” Labour rallies in support of students In an open letter to Gertler, OFL President Laura Walton accused him and the university of failing to bargain in good faith with the students involved in this peaceful protest. Walton explained that OFL members have successfully bargained with university administrators in the past and that they should take the same approach with these students. “The same approach should apply here. Negotiations must continue in good faith , and without threats of police intervention. The recent successful conclusions to the encampments at Ontario Tech University and at McMaster University, for example, shows what’s possible,” the OFL letter reads. READ MORE: Students are making history. All of us should join them “Universities should be where we learn to debate and disagree with each other– without the fear of violence . For Canada’s largest university to decide unilaterally when the debate should end, and when police repression should begin, is a betrayal of the values we claim to uphold,” the letter goes on to read. Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) Local 3902, which represents 11,000 educators and researchers at UofT likewise expressed their support for the students and condemned the university for making threats. “Your recent letter to U of T Occupy for Palestine and accompanying offer constitute a serious and deeply concerning escalation of the administration’s negotiating tactics. The CUPE 3902 Executive condemns the administration’s presentation of an offer to student organizers under the threat of forceful removal from their protest encampment,” reads a statement from CUPE 3902’s executive committee. CUPE 3902 executives added that they were prepared to take further action against the university in support of the students. Students holding firm to their demands Students involved in the encampment protest are remaining clear and consistent in their demands to UofT administration. A joint letter sent out on Friday, May 24 by the Association of Part-time Undergraduate Students (APUS), University of Toronto Graduate Students’ Union (UTGSU), University of Toronto Mississauga Students’ Union (UTMSU) and Scarborough Campus Students’ Union (SCSU), and the University of Toronto Students’ Union reaffirmed their demands that UofT administration disclose and divest from all investments in support of Israeli apartheid. “Students have been clear with their demands. The University must divest from all direct and indirect financial investments that sustain Israeli apartheid, occupation and its illegal settlement of Palestine including any manufacturing and sales of military weaponry in the ongoing genocide in Gaza,” the student unions’ letter reads. They are also calling on the university to cut all ties with Israeli academic institutions that support Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory. The unions also condemned Gertler’s threat of police force to silence them. “As a result of the recent announcements made by President Gertler to the students, we fear an escalation of the violence by the institution and police on students similar to other university campuses when their administration moved to dismantle encampments and student organizing and silencing student voices who continue to hold the university administration accountable,” the unions state. The unions also point out that UofT was one of the last Canadian academic institutions to divest itself from supporting apartheid South Africa in the 1980s. “We continue to express our support for the calls of students to the administration to take action and ensure that they divest from all forms of financial investments that sustain Israeli apartheid, occupation and its illegal settlement of Palestine,” the unions’ letter goes on to read.

        "content": "Rafael Nadal's return to the French Open lasted just one match after losing to Alexander Zverev in the first round in straight sets on Monday. Despite the loss and past teases of retirement, Nadal declined to say after the match whether or not this would be his last time playing at Roland Garros: \"I went through all this process with the dream to be back here in Roland Garros. For me it is difficult to say what is going on in the future. It is a big percentage that I will not be back playing here, but I cannot say 100 percent. I enjoy playing here. The body is feeling a little better than two months ago, so...maybe in two months I say 'it's enough,' but this is something I don't feel yet.\" This was a similar answer to what Nadal said prior to the tournament when asked about his future. \"It's a big, big chance that it's going to be my last Roland Garros,\" he said on Saturday. \"But if I have to tell you it's 100% my last Roland Garros? Sorry, but I will not. Because I cannot predict what's going on.\" There are no words. Merci, Rafa 🫶#RolandGarros @RafaelNadal pic.twitter.com/znj0j42Qbf Nadal hasn't committed to playing in Wimbledon, only saying on Monday it \"looks difficult\" for him to make the transition to competing on grass before shifting back to clay for the Olympics. After sitting out most of 2023 due to a hip injury, Nadal returned to action at the Brisbane International in December. He advanced to the quarterfinals before losing to Jordan Thompson. Following that loss, Nadal dropped the first hint that 2024 might be the final year of his career. He did quality it at that point by saying this would \"probably\" be his last season. Monday's loss marks Nadal's first non-injury defeat prior to the fourth round at the French Open. He had to withdraw prior to a third-round match against Marcel Granollers in 2016 due to a wrist injury. Zverev was a bad draw for Nadal to try and get his legs back under him in a grand slam tournament. The German star is currently the No. 4 player in the world and is coming off a semifinal run at the Australian Open in January. This was Nadal's ninth singles match since April. He is 5-4 overall with his best showing being a fourth-round run at the Madrid Open.",

        "description": "Get latest articles and stories on India at LatestLY. Former JNU student leader Umar Khalid has sought regular bail on the grounds of delay and parity with other accused persons.",
        "content": "New Delhi [India], May 27 (ANI): Delhi's Karkardooma court on Tuesday is likely to pronounce an order on the bail plea of Umar Khalid in the larger conspiracy of Delhi riots case of 2020. He has been in custody since September 2020 in a case under UAPA. Former JNU student leader Umar Khalid has sought regular bail on the grounds of delay and parity with other accused persons. Special Judge Sameer Bajpai reserved the order on May 13 after hearing the counsel at length. Delhi police's Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) opposed the plea calling it frivolous and baseless. He also filed written submissions. Umar Khalid's Counsel had argued that no terror case was made out against him and his name was repeated in the charge sheet of Delhi police. Repeating his name doesn't make a lie, a truth. There was a vicious media trial taken against him. He had also filed his written submissions. It is alleged by the Delhi police that Umar Khalid had pre-planned protests in 2020 at 23 sites that culminated in riots. After withdrawing his bail plea from the Supreme Court in February, Khalid moved to trial court seeking bail on the grounds of a change in circumstances and parity with other account-used persons. Senior advocate Tridip Pais questioned the submissions of Delhi police and asked, \"Is sharing messages a criminal or terror act?\" He also responded to submissions earlier made by the Special public prosecutor (SPP) who had said that Khalid was amplifying his narrative as part of a conspiracy by sharing certain links with people with people from politics and others on social media. Pais argued that Umar Khalid was sharing the 'correct narrative.' The senior advocate had also submitted that there was a vicious media trial taking place against Umar Khalid. He also referred to various statements of news anchors from different media channels. He said that anchors were reading from the charge sheet around the clock. He further argued that no terror case is made out against Umar Khalid and police have no material to this effect. The court must see whether a terror case is made against him or not. There are contradictions in the statement of prosecution witnesses, Pais added. In this situation, the court must determine whether the witness statement prima facie makes a terror case against Umar Khalid. Earlier it was argued that there accused persons namely Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and Asif Iqbal Tanha were granted bail by the High Court. They had a similar role to that of Umar Khalid. While opposing the bail application of Umar Khalid, Delhi police had said that his chats revealed that he is in the habit of creating narratives on media and social media to influence bail hearings. It was also submitted by the Special Public Prosecutor that several people took to X (earlier Twitter) to influence bail hearing. He had referred to the post on X by Teesta Seetalvad, Amnesty India, Akar Patel, Raj Kaushik, Swati Chaturvedi, Arju Ahmed and others. Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) while opposing the bail application of Umar Khalid referred to his WhatsApp chats. The SPP had submitted, \"WhatsApp chats also revealed that he is in habit of creating media and social media narratives at the time of listing of bail applications of the person booked in cases to clearly influence bail hearings.\" \"Similar exercise is being adopted while applicants' bails are being listed to influence his bail hearings, samples of post on X (earlier Twitter) with hashtag about applicant annexed herewith,\" SPP added. \"Thus in the light of the aforesaid, the present second application for grant of bail to the accused deserves to be dismissed by this honourable court in the interest of justice,\" SPP Prasad submitted. SPP Amit Prasad also mentioned the Post on Twitter by Teesta Seetalvad, Aakar Patel, Kaushik Raj, Swati Chaturvedi, Arju Ahmed and others. SPP had also read some of the tweets in the court. One of the tweets read \"Ram Raheem''s parole approved, Umar Khalid bail 14 times adjourned in SC. #freeumarkhalid.\" \"Umar Khalid withdraws his bail petition from SC. This is a travesty of Justice,\" another tweet read. SPP submitted that Amnesty India also tweeted which read \"SC has adjourned hearing his bail hearing 14 times. Acute Subversion of the right of Umar Khalid to get bail.\" \"#freeUmarKhalid was used,\" the SPP submitted. The SPP argued that while they claim that they were subjected to media trial, it is he who was playing around with the media, how His father gave interviews in the media and people associated with him also doing the same. In his rebuttal arguments, Senior Advocate Tridip Pais argued that a mere meeting of accused individuals doesn't imply terrorism. \"None of the witnesses didn't say anything but then miraculously said something two weeks later. All the witnesses here seem to be taking tablets for memory. Prima facie requires depth, not frivolously reading out the chargesheet,\" Pais argued. Senior advocate Pais submitted that the prosecution argument is that because I (Umar Khalid) can fain tension. Therefore I don't deserve bail. His father gave an interview therefore he doesn't deserve the bail. While arguing, the senior advocate referred to the Supreme Court judgement in Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali, Shoma Sen and Varnan Gonsalves. \"It was submitted that the allegations should be good enough to establish the allegations are substantive, to reject the bail. The duty of the court is not to deal with the material meticulously but to see the broad probability,\" the senior advocate added. On the point of terrorist activity aspect, it was submitted that there is no evidence to show it is a terrorist activity. There is nothing on record to attract section Section 15 of UAPA. The High Court and the Special Court haven't distinguished between the acts or persons. They've just painted everything with a broad brush. There is not a single witness whose statement attracts 15(1) qua me (Umar Khalid). On the point of meeting Umar Khalid, the defence counsel rejected the prosecution's arguements that meetings were secret ones. He said that Umar Khalid, Tahir Hussain and Khalid Saifi met at the office of PFI has been referred by the Prosecution on the basis of the statement of a witness CDR. \"You want to rely on CDR to deny me bail, Pais questioned. \"As per CDR they were not there at the given time and date,\" he argued. He further argued that there is no credible case of conspiracy, which is also not terror activity. There is no seizure from me that can attract the offence of terror activity. \"On the whimsical statement, sometimes even without witnesses, an act of terrorism is foisted towards me,\" Pais submitted. \"It was also said that Bangladeshi women and children were deployed at the protest sites. Did any women say that it was against me,\" Pais questioned. \"In the Varnan Gonsalves and Shoma Sen case, the views of the Supreme Court on Prima Facie and analysis of Prima facie have been clarified,\" the defence counsel argued. Pais argued that at the time of hearing bail, the court was under a duty to scan the case diary to decide whether the allegations were prima facie true or not. Third-party hearsay can not be attributed to me. \"Mere having a meeting is not enough to oppose the bail. There is no material as of now. The bail cannot be denied as the material can come later,\" Pais argued. \"If ten witnesses state my name, does that make a terror case against me? I have not indulged in a terrorist act. There is not even a seizure from me,\" Pais submitted. (ANI)",

        "content": "LOVE Island newbie Jessica White recently embarked on a dramatic body transformation ahead of her arrival in the villa. Jess, 25, has been confirmed as one of this summer's singletons set to take part in Love Island and she has been working hard to get in shape. Determined to look her best, the retail manager completed a six-month fitness overhaul with a female coach in 2022. She then went on to sculpt a 'peachy' bottom once she had slimmed down and toned up. Jess, from Stockport, was snapped in a 'before' and 'after' photograph following the first six months of her gruelling regime. In two 'before' pics, the brunette beauty could be seen in tight turquoise leggings and a black crop top while looking out of breath in the gym. Jess later posed for a selfie while wearing a skimpy zebra print bikini to show off her transformation. Posting the snaps on Instagram , Jess's personal trainer said at the time: \"6 MONTH TRANSFORMATION BABY 🥵 DECEMBER - MAY 🧨. \"Can’t tell you how proud I am of this girl! \"A few months in Jess was getting irritated that she didn’t get those QUICK results that fad diets often sell you. \"After her holiday she got straight back on it with her sessions & tracking and it’s all fallen into place. \"Consistency & self discipline is key 🔑 ❤️ Now it’s time to build 🍑 @jessamywhite forever proud.\" Jess, who has continued to train hard, replied at the time: \"Now we build me a 🍑🍑🍑🍑 always grateful for you and being there every step of the way ❤️.\" Jess is among 12 brand new islanders hoping to find romance in the Love Island villa this summer under the watchful eye of host Maya Jama . The contestant has turned to the show as she worries about being 'left behind' among her friends, who are all in long-term relationships. Speaking ahead of her big Love Island debut next week, Jess said: \"All my friends are in relationships, settled down with babies and I’m going to end up that aunt that rocks up at family parties and they say, ‘She's still not met someone, she’s still going to Ibiza having a midlife crisis’. Patsy Field - an Influencer with a disability . Samantha Kenny – works in a beauty salon Ciaran Davies – Welsh hunk and rugby player Mimii Ngulube - student nurse from Portsmouth Jess White - shop manager from Stockport Harriett Blackmore - pals with YouTuber Saffron Barker Nicole Samuel - account manager and former champion dancer Sean Stone - runs a sweet firm Sam Taylor - a hairdresser with a love of tattoos Munveer Jabbal - the oldest contestant in the villa this year Ayo Odukoya - a footballer and former model Ronnie Vint - best mates with Olivia Attwood's hubby Bradley Dack Grace Jackson – Manchester based model who is followed by Molly-Mae Hague and Conor McGregor , she is tipped to enter as a bombshell \"I just want to meet somebody and to be able to do all of that stuff too.\" In a stark warning to potential suitors, Jess has also admitted she is \"hard work\" when it comes to dating. \"I think I’m single because I don’t underestimate the fact that I’m hard work,\" she added. \"I know what I want and I'm not easily pleased. When you’re a loud, outgoing woman, sometimes it can intimidate men - men don’t always want that. \"I think that can sometimes put people off me because I am quite loud and you can hear me before you see me. Some men love that though.\"",

        "content": "With the 90th pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, the selected linebacker DeMarvion Overshown in the third round. His lengthy frame and years of leadership for the Texas Longhorns' defense made him one of the top prospects at the position, and there was expectation he could step into 's defense and contribute right away. Unfortunately, his campaign was cut short after tearing his ACL in the preseason. Now entering his second year, the Texas-native is looking to remain a fit on this defense despite . With an ongoing recovery process and a new system to work into, what can fans expect in the delayed debut from Overshown this season? The primary difference from Dan Quinn's defense is that . Measuring in at 220 pounds when he arrived at camp last season, Overshown's thin, lanky build wasn't the typical prototype for the system. But instead of twiddling his thumbs while in recovery, the 23-year-old has put in work to add weight and reshape his body. Overshown recently spoke about his offseason journey, : I've put about 12-13 pounds of lean mass on, and I'm gonna go into camp a little bigger and then drop down to where I wanna play at, which will be around 233 or 234 [pounds]. The Cowboys currently have nine linebackers on their roster. Eric Kendricks is the most familiar with Zimmer, thanks to their time together with the . Damone Clark also played over 73% of snaps last season for the team. Markquese Bell tallied over 60%, but may not be a scheme fit as a moneybacker more than a traditional linebacker. That leaves one open spot for the base-starting defense. While there are plenty of potential players who could earn the role, the headliners for the final spot are Overshown and Dallas' third-round pick in the , Marist Liufau, out of Notre Dame. Whether he operates in a starting or rotational role, Overshown's added weight, combined with his history of production throughout his collegiate career, points to him being an asset at the second level. Despite dealing with an injury in his first year, the former All-Big 12 star still has time to get going and make an impact in the league. Source:",

        "content": "The Chief Executive Officer of the Fundamental Right to Education Support (FRES) Foundation, Michael Kayode Ojo, has advocated for increased funding for the child’s education. He also called for better government intervention in the area of infrastructure development with a well-equipped library situated in a conducive learning environment. Ojo made the call at an event tagged Children’s Day Event and Award Celebration, held to reward excellence in education on Children’s Day, May 27, in Lagos on Monday. The event had over 100 pupils from ten private schools competing for prizes in indoor games, talk shows, talent hunts, and award presentations. In his remarks, Ojo said, “Today, we are celebrating the children. This is part of the activities with which we celebrate excellence in education among children. It is aimed at encouraging them. This is the third edition. “Prior to this, there was an essay competition where schools, both private and public, from the 57 local government areas in Lagos State participated in an essay competition and were rewarded accordingly. “We have identified poor parenting as one major factor militating against quality education for children. For us, we have been trying to engage parents on how they could intervene in their children’s education. “I want to encourage parents to put more effort into educating these children. Also, for the government, we are in partnership with LASUBEB. We have been engaging them. “I commend the Lagos State government on its giant stride in the education sector. I encourage other states to emulate Lagos State government but there is still more to be done to ensure that children are adequately educated. “We want the government to invest more in terms of infrastructure and funding for education because it is important for schools to have a well-equipped library and a conducive environment for learning. “Many of the private schools around do not have the capacity to do this. This is where the government comes in. They should make sure that education is put on a proper spectrum.” The programme facilitator, Pastor Babatunde Smith, said the event is an education centre award for the children. He said, “It is an investment for the education of the children. He urged parents to open an account to fund the education of the children.” The event co-sponsor, Miss Sarah Akerele of the Treasure Kids Foundation, said the event is also about rewarding parents for excellence in the discharge of parental roles and creating awareness of the educational needs of special children. She added, “The Treasure Kids Foundation is an organisation that is focused on the needs of special children. We are concerned about children with congenital disorders in society. “We do this by creating awareness, providing education, and advocating for the special needs of these children. We are here today to celebrate our children’s special day and to reward them for excellence in learning. Education is a challenge for special needs children due to their peculiar challenges, hence our decision to reward excellence in education. One major challenge is a lack of awareness and proper education for special needs children. Special education is nothing like conventional education. “It is not easy for special children to get an adequate education, and that is the gap we stand to bridge at Treasure Kids.” The highlight of the event is the presentation of cash gifts, certification of participation, and educational materials to participating schools, pupils in both the primary and secondary categories, as well as some deserving parents.

        "description": "Steve Schwarzman is a billionaire cofounder of Blackstone, the world's largest alternative asset manager.",
        "content": "The CEO of Blackstone, Steve Schwarzman, has said he will back Donald Trump's reelection bid, citing concerns over \"the dramatic rise of antisemitism\" and the \"direction\" of the country. In a statement to Axios, Schwarzman said: \"The dramatic rise of antisemitism has led me to focus on the consequences of upcoming elections with greater urgency.\" \"I share the concern of most Americans that our economic, immigration and foreign policies are taking the country in the wrong direction. For these reasons, I am planning to vote for change and support Donald Trump for President. In addition, I will be supporting Republican Senate candidates and other Republicans up and down the ticket,\" he added. Related stories The endorsement marks a reversal for Schwarzman, the billionaire cofounder of Blackstone, the world's largest alternative asset manager. In November 2022 , the lifelong Republican said he would not support Trump in the 2024 presidential primary, calling instead for \"the Republican Party to turn to a new generation of leaders.\" Schwarzman's endorsement will, therefore, come as a particularly welcome boost for Trump, providing the former president with access to a powerful network of Republican donors. It would also appear to suggest Trump's strategy of accusing Biden of being weak on antisemitism — especially in the wake of pro-Palestinian college protests — has started to pay off. \"If Jewish people are going to vote for Joe Biden, they have to have their head examined,\" Trump said in a video posted to social media earlier this month. If reelected, Trump has said he would he would revoke student visas of \"anti-Semitic foreigners\" and that he would not welcome any Gaza refugees into the US. \"Under the Trump administration, we will revoke the student visas of radical anti-American and anti-Semitic foreigners at our colleges and universities and we will send them straight back home,\" he said at a campaign speech in Iowa last year.",

        "content": "Police in Sargodha reported on Monday that they have filed criminal charges against more than 100 people involved in a recent mob attack on a Christian man and his family. The incident occurred last week after accusations surfaced that the man had desecrated the Holy Qur’an. The chaos erupted on Saturday when locals claimed they found burnt pages of the Holy Qur’an outside the Christian man’s house. Fuelled by anger, a mob set his house and shoemaking factory on fire and beat up his son. The situation escalated quickly, resembling a scene from a chaotic riot, where emotions ran high and violence spread rapidly. Fortunately, the police intervened and managed to rescue the Christian father and other men after dispersing the mob. Sargodha District Police Officer Assad Malhi described the police's swift actions as crucial in preventing a larger disaster and maintaining peace in the city. Despite the officers' efforts, several were injured during the clashes. Later that day, police registered criminal cases against those involved in the violence, arresting over 100 individuals on charges that included anti-terrorism and attempted murder. The investigation is ongoing, focusing on assessing the damage and identifying all responsible parties. The police are also working to address the underlying issues by engaging with the local community. They are collaborating with community leaders and religious scholars to promote interfaith harmony and prevent future incidents. In response to the attack, the police have increased security around important churches in the Sargodha district. They announced on social media that more than 1,000 police officers and youth volunteers are now stationed at key churches to ensure their protection.",

He was 71. Walton won two NCAA championships under John Wooden at UCLA and two more titles in the NBA, first with the Portland Trail Blazers in 1977 and then with the Boston Celtics in 1986. “Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. “As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force.” This is a developing story. Please check back for updates.",

        "content": "In context: Supply chain attacks are usually conceived to target a specific company by infecting a single element involved in the manufacturing or distribution of a software product. Once the supply chain is compromised, all downstream users and customers of the affected company can be easily targeted as well. Justice AV Solutions (JAVS) provides software products to more than 10,000 courtrooms in the US and around the world. The 35-year-old company was recently affected by a dangerous supply chain attack, in which unknown cybercriminals were able to implant their own backdoor into a supposedly legitimate, official software download. As reported by Rapid7, the supply chain attack compromised the JAVS Viewer 8.3.7 program included in the JAVS Suite 8 product. JAVS Suite is a \"database-centered\" software designed to create, manage, and view digital recordings of \"critical meetings\" in courtrooms and business environments. JAVS describes it as a \"complete AV management\" suite running on Windows 10 or later PC operating systems. As part of the main JAVS Suite, JAVS Viewer allows employees to open and manage previously recorded logs and media files. Version 8.3.7 of JAVS Viewer was found to be infected with a backdoor and was seemingly hosted on JAVS' own servers, Rapid7 confirmed. This means that all customers using that specific version of the software should take serious mitigation measures to avoid unpleasant surprises in the future. The backdoor was digitally signed to avoid triggering initial security warnings, although the signing entity was \"Vanguard Tech Limited\" and not \"Justice AV Solutions Inc.\" as it should have been. Once installed, the compromised JAVS Viewer was designed to connect to remote command-and-control servers and wait for further orders. The malware would then steal sensitive data, including hostname and OS details, browser passwords, and more. The malicious executable (fffmpeg.exe) is known to be part of the GateDoor/Rustdoor malware family and has already been flagged by many security vendors and AV solutions. JAVS officially acknowledged the supply chain attack on its website, stating that the incident (tracked as CVE-2024-4978) was now resolved with a new release of the JAVS Viewer program. According to Rapid7 analysts, the JAVS backdoor incident could have lasting consequences, including compromised systems, stolen passwords, and unauthorized remote access. All users of JAVS Viewer 8.3.7 should completely re-image any endpoint system where the program is used, as simply uninstalling or updating the software alone isn't enough to eradicate the threat. Access credentials and passwords for system accounts and web browsers should be reset as well.",

        "content": "Let me state upfront that I don’t have the inside scoop on Joe Roberts’s whole deal. All I know is that the same man who wrote a syndicated Jewish Telegraphic Agency column in February about fearing he’d have to become a U.S. immigrant-turned-refugee from Canada—which I wrote my own column about in response—who now stands accused of having invented a Jewish identity for himself. I guess it’s time! @Joe_Roberts01 , when you talk about your Jewish grandmother, do you mean grandma Jessie, or grandma Vida? https://t.co/4OtY8l9mjK pic.twitter.com/qOnwQ0Z8Qh — Christi Olson (@christiolson) May 10, 2024 Roberts has pushed back against this publicly, but thus far without addressing the specific claims: I have devoted my life to Jewish tradition and have spent the past twenty years serving the Jewish community in leadership roles. No one can diminish my bond with Judaism, erase my family's Jewish legacy, or negate my children's Jewish identity—especially not those driven by... — Joe Roberts (@Joe_Roberts01) May 13, 2024 Attempts to defame me are clear efforts to silence my voice and undermine my advocacy for Israel and the Jewish community. While they are deeply upsetting, they will not deter me. I am consulting legal counsel and will address them in due course. — Joe Roberts (@Joe_Roberts01) May 13, 2024 This leaves open, among so many other possibilities, that he is Jewish, but was less than forthright about biographical details. Also possible: everything he said was true and people on social media are trying to smear him. Also possible: he’s lied about it all and is going to pop up in the next town a purported lifelong Zoroastrian. Like I said, I don’t know! Now I will readily cop to being a curious so-and-so, who is on some level wondering what the story here turns out to be. I’m not that curious, however. Not enough to become an amateur let alone professional Joe Roberts-ologist. To me, the more interesting angle is the way squabbles over the boundaries of Jewish identity have emerged post-Oct. 7. As we discussed on a recent Bonjour Chai podcast episode, it’s not even straightforward whether there is such a thing as faking being Jewish. I mean there is, in the superficial The Mad Adventures of “Rabbi” Jacob sense, wherein you are a non-Jewish character in a 1970s French farce impersonating a rabbi due to plot twists too convoluted to get into. But there are enough definitions of Jewishness floating around that anyone who in good faith (so to speak) insists they are the thing, is the thing, at least in someone’s book. If you claim to be Indigenous and you’re not, you may get found out . Jewishness is in some sense more like being a member of a sexual minority. Someone might be lying about being bisexual, but what would it even mean to fact-check such a thing? If you’re not attempting to get married by an Orthodox rabbi or to move to Israel under the right of return, and you’re simply going around saying you’re Jewish, who’s to say otherwise? Of course, for all the internal Jewish communal discussions of gatekeeping , of which Jews feel how welcome in which environments, it can be helpful to zoom out and consider whether there is, in fact, a horde trying to get through the gates in question. Outliers aside ( George Santos , Julia Salazar ), there just plain doesn’t seem to be a tremendous interest. Or rather, there wasn’t, until we became the ultimate trending topic. If you’re Jewish, you might find yourself wishing—at least, I find myself wishing—things were just the tiniest bit less about us all the time. But if you’re not, maybe you want to be where the action is at? Maybe you wish the news cycle was all about you? I have no idea. The real question is, what is the political significance of questioning the Jewishness of a prolific pro-Israel poster? If it turns out that the accusations are true and there’s a big-on-X Zionist claiming to be Jewish under false pretenses, why would this be a source of delight for pro-Palestinian activists? After all, most Zionists aren’t Jewish. There are outright Christian Zionists, as well as non-Jews who don’t want Israel wiped off the map. Now some of it is that people are always thrilled to hear that someone with the wrong-in-their-view politics is a fraud. But I think it’s about more than that. Consider, for a moment, the place of Jews in post-Oct. 7 antizionism. There are individual Jews with antizionist beliefs, such people absolutely exist , but their numbers, for complicated reasons, seem greater than they actually are . One reason is that the Jews who want Israel gone tend to be found in places like media and academia and therefore have articles written about them, or write articles themselves. Another is that it is beneficial to pro-Palestinian activists to deflect charges of antisemitism by pointing to the presence of Jews in their movement. That is, if it is still considered important to deflect in this way; frankly it’s heartening if it even is. This is why every protest and rally scene has those big banners attesting to Jews’ opposition to the war, or to more than just the war, i.e. Israel itself. It’s not that no such Jews exist, or that they aren’t real Jews (as if I were interested in gatekeeping this!). It’s that there is an even larger group of people for whom it is useful to be like, look, we don’t hate Jews, we just hate Zionists! Thereby eliding such things as, that virtually all Jews are Zionists of one sort or another; that Zionist and Jew get used interchangeably; and that events where people mobilize against “Zionists” not infrequently include outbursts against Zionists of the non-euphemistic variety, a.k.a. Jews. This is why even in my not particularly Jewish bit of west Toronto, the signage is not just ubiquitously pro-Palestine but with an on-behalf-of-Jews motif. One of the groups listed as behind this window describes itself as “A home for white people working for justice.” I mean some white people are Jewish, and benefit-if-the-doubt the ones behind this display are, but if you’re advocating as white people , maybe pick a different sign, maybe? Although I guess Whites against those nefarious Zionists would have a different ring to it. The fact of the matter is that I have seen more stickers, pins, graffiti, etc., in recent months about how the Jews feel about Israel—negative, per the signage—than... how to put this? Than is plausible given how many Jews there are in these parts, period, let alone antizionist ones. So while you do get people questioning the Jewish authenticity or values or whatever of pro-Palestinian Jews, you also get people like yours truly, who simply doubt that a tiny minority within a tiny minority could possibly be the driving force behind Free Palestine, at the levels the signage and hashtags insist. What a boon, then, for that side to have a No wait, it’s the ZIONISTS who are the fake Jews! moment. After saying for however long (decades in some cases, or since learning about this topic a few months ago in many others) that actual Jewish values dictate opposing Israel in all ways, they see a chance to see-how-the-tables-have-turned suggest that there is some sort of epidemic of people pretending to be Jewish in order to...? all the foaming-at-the-mouth zionists who have taken to the soapbox (anthony koch, richard marceau, joe roberts, deborah lyons) were neither born jewish, nor raised w/ jewish values. why are these genocide enthusiasts speaking on behalf of us? why are they defining antisemitism? https://t.co/n93fuAaPuv — cornchip (@scorn_chip) May 23, 2024 But here is where I’m lost. Jews tend to like having allies. Particularly in times like these. And an ally is by definition not a member of the group in question, nor claiming to be. If there are pro-Israel Jews who took/take comfort in Roberts’s anti-antisemitism, Israel-defending timeline, of course they’d take it as a blow if it turns out he’s not quite who he says. But this isn’t because Jews demand that everyone who fights antisemitism be Jewish. Hardly! It’s that it’s never a good thing when someone on your side is outed as disreputable.

        "content": "Stacey Solomon fans have been left stunned after the mum-of-five revealed another 'genius' trick that helps her get her chaotic house in order quickly. The reality TV star and host of Sort Your Life Out shared how she spent her Sunday evening cleaning up her home after having a lazy day and letting it go 'to ruin'. Surveying the mess at Pickle Cottage, which she shares with husband Joe Swash and the children, Stacey posted a video on Instagram and told her followers: \"I really did what I said I was gonna to do today and just did nothing.\" READ MORE: Gogglebox star Izzi Warner shares emotional solo trip with kids to Disneyland She added: \"I had a little nap and everything. The house has gone to ruin but it's okay - it's Sunday and I was tried. I am gonna give it a good clean now.\" Stacey then posted another video to her Story - a montage of her getting her house in order sound tracked to Daniel Bedingfield's 2001 hit Gotta Get Thru This. She could be seen washing dishes, loading up the dishwasher, wiping down her kitchen and mopping the floor as she tidied away the mess. But her fans were left distracted by one particular detail in the video - the unusual but 'genius' way she loaded up her dishwasher. Instead of bending down to put her dirty dishes inside the machine, Stacey lifted the trays out placing them on her kitchen island and then stacked them full of plates and bowls before returning them to the machine. The video showed Stacey stacking up the dishwasher trays while they were on top of her kitchen island (Image: Stacey Solomon / Instagram) Stacey was inundated with messages about the dishwasher hack and addressed her followers in another video explaining why she does it. She also posted photos of some of the messages she received, with one saying: \"I have literally never thought of taking the racks out of the dishwasher to load them up, genius\" and another commenting: \"Omg stacey why have I never thought to take the dishwasher trays to the mess.\" She told her followers: \"So many of you are messaging me the same thing. Do you know what right, as I get older, I get lazier and I try and find more and more ways of having to do less and make less effort. I just think why bend down.\" At that moment she was interrupted by husband Joe, who walked into the shot holding two fluffy ducklings - the latest additions to their already large family. As Joe smiled at the camera in the background, Stacey carried on with her explanation, saying: \"Why bend down to put things in the dishwasher when you can just whip the trays out and stack them on the side.\" Stacey explained why she took the trays out of her dishwasher in another video - but was interrupted by husband Joe (Image: Stacey Solomon / Instagram) Joe then told her he was taking 'the chicks' to bed and Stacey wound up her video so she could help him. The two ducklings were welcomed to their home last week and they've already proved to be popular with fans of the family. Stacey, 34, and Joe, 42, share three young children - Rex, four, Rose, two, and one-year-old Belle. Stacey also has a 15-year-old son named Zachary and a 12-year-old son named Leighton, who she shares with former partners, while Joe is also dad to his teenage son Harry. They also have two beloved pet dogs - Teddy and Peanut - who help keep the family's Essex home full and busy. And now it's even busier with the arrival of two new pets. Taking to Instagram, Stacey shared a video of them as they settled into their home. The video included clips of Rex and Rose enjoying cuddles with the new additions while the mum herself was also seen tending to the new duo. First sharing a message to her Instagram Story, she wrote: \"We've always felt so privileged to have our garden... And we've always said if the chance ever presented itself and it was right and we had what they needed, we'd love to make it home for little feathered friends [face holding back tears emoji]. So...\" She then pointed fans in the direction of her main Instagram post with the caption reading: \"Welcome To Pickle Cottage. Little Ones. We are so excited to love you & we hope you love living here & being a part of our crazy family. We have no idea what to call our new babies yet, so any suggestions welcome.\"",

        "description": "Chief of Staff Nicolás Posse could be asked to step down following debate over the Ley de Bases in Congress La entrada Milei eyes cabinet reshuffle: who could stay and who could go se publicó primero en Buenos Aires Herald.",
        "content": "While the process has taken longer than the government might have hoped, the congressional debate over the flagship reform bill known as Ley Bases is a clear victory for the Milei administration. Yet as the self-described anarcho-capitalist inches closer to realizing his legislative agenda, his cabinet could be in flux, with Chief of Staff Nicolás Posse on the chopping block. “Our first government milestone would be the outcome of the Ley Bases. It could go well, or it may not be approved,” Milei told LN+ news channel last Thursday. “After that milestone is reached, we will have to evaluate the results , and the entire cabinet will be under analysis. Not just Posse, but all of the ministers.” After being approved in the Lower House in late April, the proposal, also known as Omnibus Bill, is now being discussed by senators in commissions. Lawmakers are expected to approve a final version of the bill in the coming days and hold a session to debate and vote on its contents next week. A potential government turnover could take place after that, and, if approved, Milei’s “May Pact” would become the law of the land as early as June. “We will evaluate what worked, and what didn’t work will be changed,” Milei said. Rumors of Posse’s potential departure have been increasing in recent days. After skipping several government events last month, he attended a religious service held each year on May 25 at the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral with the president and other ministers. Posse also appeared at Milei’s rally in Córdoba later that day, despite speculation that he would not show. Still, Milei’s rift with Posse was evident: during both events, the president declined to shake his chief of staff’s hand. The Córdoba rally presenter also failed to mention Posse by name while listing all of the cabinet members in attendance. The president praised several ministers during his speech, but not Posse’s. Since Milei assumed power in December, Posse has been one of the few members in his inner circle, along with his sister, Presidency Secretary Karina Milei, and his main political advisor, Santiago Caputo. Presidential spokesman Manuel Adorni denied that Posse would be leaving the cabinet during a press conference last week. “That is clearly not true,” he said. “There will not be any changes in the government.” A new stage of government During the same interview in which he pointed to future cabinet changes, Milei mentioned that former Central Bank President Federico Sturzenegger will become a minister if the Ley Bases is approved in the Senate. The legislation’s passage would be the start of the second stage of his “structural reforms,” he said. Sturzenegger has worked closely with Milei since he took office, despite not having an official role in the government initially. In January, he was named head of the “Transitory Unit for Economic Deregulation.” Along with the Omnibus Bill, he co-authored Milei’s massive presidential decree that deregulated the Argentine economy. Despite claiming that Sturzenegger will join the cabinet in an official capacity, current Economy Minister Luis “Toto” Caputo doesn’t appear to be in any danger of being removed. During his speech on Saturday, Milei mentioned him several times, saying Caputo was in charge of “the largest austerity plan in history.” Two weeks ago, Milei also congratulated Caputo on the nation’s 8.8% April inflation rate , gloating that he had scored a “goal.” “I’m going to start calling Toto ‘piggybank,’ because you need to break him into pieces to get a penny out of him,” he had said the day before during an event with business people. “He is unbreakable, and if you want to break him, you’ll have to break me first.” Human Capital Minister Sandra Pettovello’s job also appears to be safe. “Was I wrong when I said Pettovello is harder than a statue’s curl?” Milei asked during an interview with LN+ on May 18, lauding her “unmasking” of Peronism for reporting alleged irregularities in the previous government’s ministry of social development. “I am her friend,” he said. “I know she won’t back down.” Interior Minister Guillermo Francos has been tasked with drumming up support from governors and lawmakers for the Ley Bases since February. In April, Milei said Francos is one of his government’s “doves,” as it’s his role to negotiate with provincial officials and the opposition. The president included Foreign Minister Diana Mondino, Vice President Victoria Villarruel, and Lower House President Martín Menem in that group as well. While he didn’t say who the “hawks” were, Milei joked during an interview with El Observador that he and Security Minister Patricia Bullrich are the “talibans” of the government. “Talibans put the votes on the table,” he told the newspaper. “That’s Patricia and me. Patricia is fabulous, wonderful, amazing. I am fascinated.” Bullrich ran against Milei for the presidency last year. On the campaign trail, Milei referred to her as a “terrorist” for her political activism during the 1970s, but later made amends, leading to her endorsement of him for president ahead of the November runoff election. Last Friday, Francos told Rivadavia radio station that he accepts that he may have fulfilled his duties as interior minister and “may not be needed in the next [stage of government].” “I will remain in my position as long as Milei tells me to,” he added. Despite the rumors and public statements, there are no certainties regarding how or when the cabinet reshuffle will be carried out, only that it will potentially happen after the Ley Bases is debated.",

        "description": "It's not just a cancelation bloodbath on network TV right now. Streamers like Apple TV+ are at it too.",
        "content": "If you haven’t glanced at the full list of canceled and ending shows , you may be in for a bit of a shock this TV season. It’s been a network bloodbath over the last month, as some fan-favorites from So Help Me Todd to Walker got canceled , and some other big shows like Young Sheldon ended. But it’s not just network TV that’s quietly been shuffling shows off the 2024 TV schedule ; in fact, even Apple TV+ quietly canceled two shows this month. Honestly, this sort of rom-com TV series often ends far too soon . Cristin Milioti’s highly-touted How I Met Your Mother follow-up A to Z dabbled in the genre and notably only made it for 13 episodes. Selfie with John Cho and GOTG star Karen Gillan only made it one season. Pushing Daisies made it two. Look, Darren Starr’s had a bit more luck with the genre with Younger and Emily in Paris by juxtaposing the rom-com storylines with fun and fashionable career opps. And Hallmark has had some long-running rom-coms find success with lower budgets. On a whole, though, it can be a tough genre to get to stick on TV. So, while perhaps this isn’t a huge shocker, I do think the timing of the cancelation is is worth talking out as it is the second call Apple TV+ has made this month. We previously learned the streaming service had also axed Constellation , a space-related series about an astronaut (played by Noomi Rapace ) who returns to Earth after staying behind to make repairs following an International Space Station incident. That show also only lasted one season on the streamer. It's interesting timing for Apple TV+ to make these two calls, as well. May is the time of year when TV fans' sights are still fairly geared on the network TV schedule. Even if those fans are watching network TV on streaming platforms now, the fates of some of their favorite shows are still tied to the Live+7 audiences, and those two audiences are not always on the same page. Ergo, much of what we've been discussing here at CinemaBlend over the last month has been network shows that we've had to say goodbye to. Meawhile, some streaming services have cancelled more one season shows with very little fanfare. It's not just Apple TV+ either, though I singled out the streamer given it quietly canceled two shows and not just one during the month of May. In another example, Max also just under-the-radar canceled The Girls on the Bus just a few days ago. Of course streaming works differently. If you've been wondering why so many first season shows on streaming get canceled , there is a reason, and that has to do with streaming services greenlighting full seasons instead of just pilots for shows. That way those services get the opportunity to drop a full season and see if audiences bite. However, it also means that a lot of shows get one season and then fade out of memory pretty fast. It makes me wonder if these quiet cancelations have been so quiet because these shows haven't garnered huge audiences or if timing the news for May couldn't have gone better for the streamers. Either way, though, it's definitely interesting enough to point out. Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News",

        "description": "The Israeli prime minister has so far proven resilient to all kinds of setbacks, but now faces huge challenges Read Full Article at RT.com",
        "content": "In recent weeks, many events have unfolded that could seriously disrupt the plans of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. However, his political career shows that he has repeatedly emerged from similar challenges, while only strengthening his position. The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Karim Khan, has asked the ICC to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu along with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and three leaders of the Palestinian group Hamas. Khan believes that they are all potentially guilty of war crimes committed during the Hamas attack on Israel and the subsequent Israeli military operation in Gaza. Adding to Netanyahu’s troubles, on May 28, three European countries – Spain, Ireland, and Norway – will recognize the State of Palestine, with Slovenia and Belgium potentially joining them later. Western countries are beginning to shift away from their unwavering support for Israel. Last December, several Global South countries, including South Africa, also took a stand. South Africa filed a complaint with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Israel, accusing it of genocide in Gaza. As we can see, many storm clouds have gathered over the Israeli authorities, but let’s try to understand where this might lead. Khan stated that there are reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Gallant are responsible for using starvation as a method of warfare, attacking civilians, and depriving them of essential resources such as food, water, and medical supplies. The accusations have sparked strong criticism from Israel and its allies, including the US. President Joe Biden called the ICC’s decision “outrageous” . Israeli and American officials claimed that the ICC warrants undermine international law and moral principles by equating the actions of a democratically elected government with those of a terrorist organization. Israel and the US, neither of which are ICC members, are considering sanctions against the court and its leadership. Netanyahu responded by saying, “Mr. Khan is creating a dangerous precedent that undermines the right of any democracy to defend itself from terrorist organizations and aggressors.” His office later described the ICC’s decision as a “blood libel” and a “crossing of the red line.” Israeli President Isaac Herzog called on the international community to condemn the prosecutor’s decision, noting that the court’s jurisdiction is recognized only by the 124 countries that have ratified the Rome Statute. Several countries – including the US, Israel, China, Iran, India, and Russia – do not recognize the ICC’s jurisdiction. Despite the lack of support for the ICC’s move from Israel’s major allies – the US, UK, France, and other Western countries – media coverage has been largely negative for the Israeli authorities. While Israel does not recognize the ICC’s jurisdiction, Palestine, as a permanent observer at the UN, does, allowing the court to begin its investigation. In response to threats and pressure from Israel and the US, the ICC warned that such attempts could be seen as interference in the administration of justice and contrary to the principles of the Rome Statute. Amid these events, a controversy with Berlin emerged. German law enforcement agencies are obliged to comply with ICC directives if an arrest warrant is issued by the chief prosecutor, as stated by government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit. “We adhere to the law,” Hebestreit said, according to Spiegel. Thus, even though no ICC arrest warrant for Netanyahu has been issued yet, the situation has already caused significant international resonance, increasing tension in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and threatening to complicate diplomatic efforts to resolve the situation. Even if an arrest warrant is issued, it is unlikely that Netanyahu will be arrested and handed over to the ICC. However, it is clear that the situation negatively impacts the reputation of the current leaders of the Jewish state. As detailed previously , the relationship between Joe Biden’s administration and the Netanyahu government is a complicated one, and misunderstandings are only likely to deepen as IDF operations in Gaza continue. With the onset of military action in the southern part of Gaza, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin confirmed Washington’s decision to delay the transfer of a batch of ammunition to Israel due to the situation around Rafah. “We have made it very clear that Israel cannot launch a large-scale attack on Rafah without considering the civilians caught in the theater of operations and without protecting them. We assessed the situation and paused the delivery of a batch of powerful ammunition,” The Times of Israel quoted him as saying during a Senate hearing. Bloomberg, citing sources, noted that this batch included 3,500 bombs. Meanwhile, the US remains Israel’s largest arms supplier, with nearly 70% of Israel’s arms imports between 2014 and 2018 coming from the US, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Therefore, restrictions on arms supplies could complicate the situation for the Israeli armed forces and even create new threats in the short term. Many experts believe that Washington is playing a “double game.” On the one hand, it declares support for Israel, threatens the ICC, and does not exert direct pressure on the Israeli government. But on the other, it limits arms supplies, actively interacts with Israeli War Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz (Netanyahu’s main internal political rival), stirs negative rhetoric around Bibi through the media, and sometimes even covertly influences international organizations and NGOs to pressure the Israeli prime minister and his entourage. Relations are also strained with other Western allies. On May 28, three European countries are expected to recognize Palestine. The leaders of Ireland, Norway, and Spain announced their intention at a time of mass pro-Palestinian rallies, with protesters calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. One might ask: why these three countries? Firstly, such a decision is motivated by the authorities’ desire to reassure their citizens and demonstrate that their voices matter. Secondly, they joined a number of their European partners who previously recognized Palestine (Bulgaria, Hungary, Cyprus, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Sweden), with Belgium and Slovenia expected to follow soon. Thirdly, the European Parliament elections will be held from June 6 to 9, and recognizing Palestine could garner additional votes for allies of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. So, this is a good PR move for the initiators. It will not significantly impact the conflict, since 146 UN member states have officially recognized Palestine in previous decades. However, it is another signal to the Israeli authorities, with the West led by Washington trying to pressure them. It is becoming increasingly clear that Prime Minister Netanyahu has become inconvenient and uncontrollable for them. Bibi feels growing pressure and has already recalled his ambassadors from three countries for consultations. Recently, a video was published in Israel showing Palestinian militant groups capturing and taking mutilated Israeli women to Gaza. Why publish this now? Largely to quell anti-government sentiment among the citizens, who fill the squares in major Israeli cities on Saturday evenings, expressing dissatisfaction with the Netanyahu far-right cabinet’s actions. It also sends a message to the international community, showing the brutality of Israel’s adversaries in Gaza. Additionally, there is a new decision by the International Court of Justice on a case filed by South Africa, joined by Türkiye, Egypt, and several other countries. The ICJ in The Hague ruled that Israel must immediately cease its military operation in Rafah. “The Court considers that, under the Genocide Convention, Israel must immediately cease its military offensive and any other actions in the Rafah governorate that may create living conditions for Palestinians in Gaza leading to their partial or total physical destruction,” said the court president, Nawaf Salam. This call was supported by 13 of the 15 judges. The court also ruled that Israel must preserve all evidence of the alleged genocide and provide unrestricted access to Gaza for investigation commissions, fact-finding missions, or any other bodies authorized by the UN to probe genocide claims. The panel of judges also demanded that Israel open the Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt for humanitarian aid deliveries. Salam added that Israel must report to the court within a month on the implementation of the verdict. It has been almost eight months since latest major escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict erupted. Internally, no significant changes have occurred around the conflict; there are only numerous casualties on both sides. However, this time the situation seems different concerning external positions. The Palestinian resistance has successfully garnered international support, initially from crowds in the streets and now from official representatives. It is premature to speak about the full recognition of a Palestinian state as a bona fide UN member, as countries like the US and UK block the UN General Assembly’s recognition of Palestine, citing the necessity of a peace agreement between Palestinians and Israelis before such a step can be taken. Within societies themselves, the situation is also complex. Attempts to resolve the conflict based on the “two states for two peoples” formula moved the peace process forward in 1993 with the Oslo Accords. These agreements included the recognition of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and the implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The issue of borders remained contentious, even when considering the pre-1967 lines. The initial euphoria and belief that peace was imminent did not last long. On November 4, 1995, Yigal Amir, a student and Jewish extremist, assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, citing his desire to “protect the people of Israel from the Oslo Accords.” There were also many opponents among Palestinians, some of whom openly criticized PLO leader Yasser Arafat’s actions. After Arafat’s death in 2004, shrouded in mystery (many believe he was poisoned), the normalization process stalled. Netanyahu understands all this better than anyone. He undoubtedly sees and comprehends the actions of Western allies. Bibi has always pursued his policies, relying solely on himself and his closest associates. Therefore, these “political games” are likely to continue. Years of conflict have formed radicals on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides. Thus, a resolution will likely require a comprehensive approach and a consensus among leading world powers and the elites of both sides. Unfortunately, it seems that the Israeli-Palestinian question, like the broader Middle East region, may need to undergo a catharsis through destructive warfare, after which a new socio-political landscape and security architecture can begin to take shape.",

        "content": "United Nations: World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday referred to the Global Traditional Medicine Centre set up in India and the first global summit on traditional medicine hosted by the country as he underlined that the year 2023 was a productive one in the UN health agency’s work supporting access to medicines and other health products. “We also established the Global Traditional Medicine Centre in India, and hosted the first global summit on traditional medicine,” Ghebreyesus said in his remarks as he presented his report to the 77th World Health Assembly in Geneva. In March 2022, the Government of India and the UN health agency had signed an agreement to establish the WHO Global Centre for Traditional Medicine. This global knowledge centre for traditional medicine, supported by an investment of USD 250 million from India, aims to harness the potential of traditional medicine from across the world through modern science and technology to improve the health of people and the planet, the UN health agency had said in a press release at the time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said the agreement between the Ministry of Ayush and WHO to establish the Global Centre for Traditional Medicine (GCTM) – world’s first – at Jamnagar, Gujarat, is a commendable initiative. He laid the foundation stone of WHO-GCTM in Jamnagar in April 2022. Speaking on the occasion, Modi had said that the WHO-GCTM is recognition of India’s contribution and potential in this field. “India’s traditional medicine system is not limited only to treatment. It is a holistic science of life. India takes this partnership as a huge responsibility for serving the entire humanity.” WHO had convened the Traditional Medicine Global Summit in August last year in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. The summit was co-hosted by India, which held the G20 presidency in 2023. It was held alongside the G20 Health Ministerial meeting. The summit explored the role of traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine in addressing pressing health challenges and driving progress in global health and sustainable development. Ghebreyesus had arrived in Gujarat to attend the global summit on traditional medicine and was accorded a warm welcome. Praising India for its “rich history” of traditional medicine like Ayurveda and yoga, Ghebreyesus had stressed the need to integrate this ancient medicinal knowledge into the national health system of countries. “India has a rich history of traditional medicine through Ayurveda, including yoga, which has been shown to be effective in alleviating pain. The Gujarat Declaration, the main outcome of this summit, will focus on integration of traditional medicines in national health systems, and help unlock the power of traditional medicine through science,” the WHO chief had said. In his address to the World Health Assembly Monday, Ghebreyesus said 2023 was a year of many challenges, but also of many achievements. He said the year 2023 was a productive one in WHO’s work supporting access to medicines and other health products. “We prequalified 120 medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and other products last year for HIV, malaria, multidrug-resistant TB, Ebola, polio and COVID-19, as well as the first long-acting insulin analogues,” he said. He noted that one of the biggest disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was to routine immunization programmes in many countries, resulting in backsliding coverage and outbreaks of measles, diphtheria, polio, yellow fever and more. “In April last year, we launched ‘The Big Catch Up’ with UNICEF and Gavi, to support countries to shut down outbreaks and restore immunization programmes at least to pre-pandemic levels,” he said. In May last year, the WHO chief had declared an end to both COVID-19 and mpox as global health emergencies. “We continue to call on all countries to maintain and reinforce the capacities for surveillance, detection and response that they built during the pandemic. These investments must not go to waste.”",

        "content": "Police are ensuring they are more visible at the Dunedin bus hub following the death of Enere Mclaren-Taana last Thursday. PHOTO: PETER MCINTOSH It comes as Dunedin Mayor Jules Radich yesterday announced the formation of a multi-agency working group dedicated to changing the culture at the central city hub. The father of a Dunedin teenager, whose son was assaulted at secondary school about a month ago, told the Otago Daily Times his wife called police at 2pm on Thursday last week to check on the status of the investigation into their son’s assault. The police responded by saying they had been too busy to investigate her son’s assault and she replied by saying \"someone is going to die if you guys don’t start taking this stuff seriously\". A little over an hour later Trinity Catholic College pupil Enere Mclaren-Taana, 16, was stabbed to death. The teenager’s father said police had now carried out an interview with the boy who they believe assaulted their son. \"But it took a death before they actually got around to doing anything. \"That’s what’s annoying me, they’re saying they got there within a minute, but they’ve had so many warnings.\" He said the teenager who assaulted their son led a crew of followers, who he called his \"soldiers\", who had been intimidating other teenagers around the city, including at the bus hub. They had complained about their son’s assault, including providing a voice recording of another teenager threatening to slit his throat, to police about a month ago and had got nowhere. Their son was scared to go back to school and has not been back to the bus hub since. \"He’s been wanting to carry a knife and I said ‘no, you can’t do that’.\" When he found out Enere had died, he felt terrible. \"It was almost like we were almost responsible for it. \"We were just trying to warn them because it was getting out of hand.\" The father said another parent who had stopped a fight in the bus hub and was trying to make a complaint had also been \"brushed aside\" by police in the past. \"I think they thought it’s just normal teenage stuff.\" The father felt security at the bus hub was ineffective and called for police presence between 3pm and 5pm on weekdays. A police spokesman said there would be more of a police presence from 3pm to 5pm at the bus hub. He said the safety of the community was not solely a police issue, and they worked closely with different agencies to ensure everyone in the community was safe. \"That important work continues.\" Trinity Catholic College year 12 pupil Enere Mclaren-Taana’s school ID photo from this year. PHOTO: SUPPLIED Logan Park High School principal Peter Hills said pupils, parents and the wider community had all expressed concern about the bus hub as a gathering point. \"There is a desire from all the groups I have mentioned for students to be picked up from schools and taken home rather than a central location, but we can’t control the funding or the bus schedule. \"I imagine that will be a subject of conversation for all schools, and the regional council and the city council, and all the people interested in it.\" In a statement yesterday, Mr Radich said he and representatives from the Dunedin City Council, Otago Regional Council and police met yesterday morning and agreed on a new group. \"While our focus as a city needs to remain on supporting Enere’s whānau as they prepare to farewell their loved one, we also need to do what we can to ensure this sort of tragedy isn’t repeated,\" Mr Radich said. The terms of reference were being drafted and would seek to ensure schools, bus users, and the wider community were all represented. The group would aim to develop short-, medium- and long-term options that could be implemented to improve the culture at the bus hub, and it would meet regularly. \"Last week’s terrible tragedy has sent shockwaves through our community, and we all need to come together to address the issues.\" Otago Regional Council chairwoman Gretchen Robertson said public safety at the hub was a priority for all parties. \"This new group is exactly what we need to be doing — working together to tackle the safety issues there.\" In the meantime there would be an increased security presence at the bus hub alongside a beefed-up police presence, and Bus Stop B would remain closed as a mark of respect. \"We are aware of issues at the hub and are working hard to support people with added security and presence.\" Police Otago Coastal Area Commander Inspector Marty Gray said police wanted to work with all parties to improve safety. \"We’re looking forward to having an active role in the group and helping ensure everyone can use the bus hub with confidence.\" Meanwhile, Ministry of Education Te Tai Runanga (south) leader Nancy Bell said it was in contact with 12 schools last week, as the impact of a traumatic event such as this could be far-reaching. The ministry’s traumatic incidents teams could work alongside schools to support them in managing the incident safely — which included understanding the emotional and psychological impacts and the effects on how people behaved. The ministry was providing some resources to Trinity Catholic College to increase pastoral support for pupils this week.",

[YONHAP] North Korea said early Tuesday that an attempt to launch its latest spy satellite rocket late Monday ended in failure after its first-stage rocket exploded midair. The rocket carrying its satellite, Malligyong-1, exploded during the first-stage flight Monday night after launching from the Sohae launching station on its west coast, reported the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). This marks the North's third failed attempt to put a spy satellite into orbit. Pyongyang acknowledged its failure at 12:22 a.m. Tuesday, soon after South Korea's military said it had detected North Korea attempt to put a purported military reconnaissance satellite into orbit. The South's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said the projectile was launched in a southward direction over the Yellow Sea from the North's northwestern Tongchang-ri area at about 10:44 p.m. Monday. It said that around 10:46 p.m., many pieces of debris was found in the waters, assessing that the rocket carrying the satellite exploded midair shortly after takeoff. The JCS said that a detailed analysis is underway between South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities about the projectile's trajectory. The rocket flew southwest over waters between the Korean Peninsula and China, a similar trajectory North Korea had used in its previous satellite launches.

The leaders in their joint declaration reaffirmed their commitment to promote peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. During the three-way summit, Yoon and Kishida called on Pyongyang to cease from carrying out a satellite launch, citing that it would be in violation of UN Security Council resolutions that ban the country from using such ballistic missile technology. Early Monday, North Korea notified Japan of its plan to launch a satellite sometime before June 4. It had designated three areas for the rocket debris is to fall, as a safety precaution. The launch came on the first day of the eight-day window.

[JOINT PRESS CORPS] South Korea's presidential office said late Monday that the National Security Office immediately reported the North's latest satellite launch to the president after the military detected it and held a meeting to assess the situation. Participants at the meeting led by National Security Adviser Chang Ho-jin said North Korea's latest launch of a military spy satellite, which comes despite repeated warnings from the South Korean government and the international community, \"is a violation of UN Security Council resolutions regardless of whether it is successful or not.\" They condemned it as a \"provocative act that threatens the peace and security of the Korean Peninsula, Northeast Asia and the international community,\" said the presidential office. Pyongyang successfully put its first military spy satellite into orbit in November last year. It came after two previous unsuccessful attempts last May and August. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he wants to see three additional satellites launched this year at a meeting with the ruling Workers' Party officials in December.

The rocket flew southwest over waters between the Korean Peninsula and China, a similar trajectory North Korea had used in its previous satellite launches. The KCNA on Tuesday quoted an aerospace administration official as attributing the accident to the operational reliability of a new \"liquid oxygen plus petroleum\" engine, after a preliminary examination by experts. It will be reviewing other causes for the explosion.
