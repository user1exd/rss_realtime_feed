        "content": "While difficulty isn’t the be-all-end-all when it comes to K-pop performances, there’s something to be said for groups that can pull off some of the hardest choreos in the industry. These stages are totally awe-inducing—you’ll be stunned by how well these idols can perform! In no particular order, here are some of the toughest choreographies in K-pop. Synchronizing 13 members is a feat in and of itself, but this dance break has some of the most complex footwork that K-pop has ever seen! The level of detail required to make this choreography look good is a feat that is difficult to truly achieve. SEVENTEEN is known for great choreography, but “MAESTRO” might just be their best yet! This is one of the most iconic fourth generation girl group choreos for a reason! You might be fooled by how easy the ITZY members make this choreography look, but there are a lot of fast-moving details that take even experienced dancers hours to master. Plus, with a five-member group, the focus is on everyone at all times—there’s no room for mistakes! An NCT U unit comprised of incredibly talented members, the choreographer most certainly took advantage of their dance skills when creating this choreography. With complex jumps and turns as part of practically every move, this one definitely isn’t for the faint of heart. NCT is another group known for tough choreo, but “The 7th Sense” might be one of their hardest of all. It’s not always about the energy required to perform a dance—sometimes technique is everything! There’s a massive amount of detail in this choreo, and even professional dancers can struggle to get it right. Based on a genre of dance called tutting, the amount of practice required to nail each and every angle in this choreo earned Irene and Seulgi massive respect. Speaking of energy, you better hope that your cardio (and your knees) are in great shape if you want to perform this one! With fast footwork and a ton of jumps, TXT’s B-side track “Can’t We Just Leave The Monster Alive?” might be one of the B-side tracks with the most difficult choreography. It’s amazing that the members can perform this song in concert and just keep going! On tempo alone, this choreo is amazingly difficult to master! The level of synchronization that the Kep1er members display in this song even at high speeds is remarkable, as are the numerous formation changes that make this choreography stand out. Most dancers will tell you that floor work is some of the most exhausting choreo, but the members make it look easy! Known all over the industry, Taemin’s hit song “MOVE” features some deceptively difficult choreo. The key to this one is the ability to isolate different parts of your body, and it’s not something just anyone can do like Taemin. Anyone who’s tried it can tell you that it’s super hard to make this dance look good because it’s so isolation-focused. This choreography took the world by storm, and it’s easy to see why! It’s some of the most energetic and complex choreo in K-pop, with a ton of big movements and little details. It even starts with a stunt, which really sets the tone for the rest of the dance. There is some seriously crazy footwork in here, so be prepared to get your cardio in! What do you think are some of the hardest choreos in K-pop? Tell us below!",

        "description": "Against the backdrop of rapidly warming relations between China and Middle Eastern countries, COMAC is exploring opportunities in Saudi Arabia.",
        "content": "Last week, a delegation from the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China ( ), led by its Chairman, He Dongfeng, visited the headquarters of the Saudia Group in , . This visit is believed to be part of their participation in the Future Aviation Forum held in Riyadh. According to a statement by Saudia Group spokesperson Abdullah Alshahrani, during COMAC's visit to Jeddah, besides visiting the Saudia Group headquarters, He Dongfeng and his delegation also toured the village of aviation service provider Saudia Technic. This MRO village, located adjacent to King Abdulaziz International Airport (JED) in Jeddah, covers an area of approximately one million square meters. It is expected to be completed by 2025 and will accommodate manufacturing operations for global aerospace companies. According to UAE news agency, The National, during He Dongfeng's visit, Saudia Group offered COMAC the opportunity to establish an assembly line in Jeddah. One of COMAC's goals in participating in the Future Aviation Forum was to market its current aircraft models, the and regional aircraft, to Middle Eastern customers. This interaction is driven by COMAC's strategic initiative to expand its global network, the deepening relationship between Saudi Arabia and China, and Saudi Arabia's current emphasis on developing emerging manufacturing industries. The Saudi civil aviation authority, the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA), signed a Memorandum of Understanding ( ) with COMAC to explore opportunities to localize the aviation industry and develop the local supply chain. At the Future Aviation Forum in Riyadh, He Dongfeng stated: \"COMAC hopes to enhance global connectivity and diversity by contributing to the development of Saudi Arabian air transport.\" He also mentioned that COMAC's C919 and ARJ21 aircraft can serve Saudi Arabia's growing domestic and regional aviation market. He said, \"COMAC plans to strengthen connectivity within a 2,000-kilometer radius, covering the Arabian Peninsula, the Middle East, Turkey, North Africa, and other regions.\" COMAC is also developing a long-range wide-body aircraft, the C929. He Dongfeng explained that this aircraft could support Saudi Arabia's plans to establish an international hub. Initially, this project was a joint venture between China and Russia named CR929, but it has been delayed due to Russia's withdrawal. However, according to AGBI—Arabian Gulf Business Insight, Saudi Arabia's newly established national airline will not consider COMAC for its narrow-body aircraft order, which will be announced later this year. A Riyadh Air spokesperson told AGBI, \"The narrow-body aircraft order is in its final stages, with negotiations ongoing between Airbus and Boeing.\" Currently, in addition to addressing the , COMAC's C919 project also needs to obtain EASA certification to enter the mainstream European market. However, there have been few reports on the progress of EASA's review. Saudi Arabia is investing billions of dollars in its \"Vision 2030\" plan to diversify its economy, reduce dependence on fossil fuels, and develop a vibrant private sector. This plan includes a massive expansion of the aviation sector, such as establishing a new airline, ordering new aircraft, and planning the construction of a large international airport to compete with its regional rival, the current Gulf tourism hub, the UAE. In recent years, cooperation between China and Arab countries has grown increasingly close. The first China-Arab States Summit was held on December 9, 2022, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, attended by Chinese President Xi Jinping and national leaders from all Arab countries. This week, the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum will be held in Beijing on May 30. Chinese President Xi Jinping will again attend the opening ceremony of the meeting, indicating that China has placed cooperation with Arab countries as a strategic priority for the nation.

        "content": "Kozhikode: The Kozhikode District Sessions Court has granted anticipatory bail to Rahul P Gopal's mother and sister, accused in the Pantheerankavu domestic abuse case. Meanwhile, the court directed them to appear before the investigating officer for questioning. If arrested, they are to be released on station bail, the court order said. Rahul's mother, Usha Kumari, and sister, Karthika, were accused by the police in the case. Following reports that they were charged with dowry harassment, they sought anticipatory bail. The prosecution opposed the bail, arguing that the accused had ignored two notices from the investigation team for questioning. The defence argued that Usha and Karthika were not named in the initial complaint by the girl and were added later. They also contended that the issue was unrelated to dowry, as stated in the FIR. Efforts are underway to bring Rahul back from abroad, with plans to issue a red corner notice for his return. The woman from Ernakulam's Paravur entered wedlock with Rahul on May 5. When the domestic violence made headlines on May 8, the woman's family opened up about the brutal torture. The woman told police that Rahul made her drink alcohol forcibly, causing her to vomit.

        "content": "Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are set to benefit from easy access to loans through credit guarantors, when a new bill is passed and enacted. The draft bill, credit guarantee policy, and Amendments to the CBK Act, aim to establish a strong, competitive, and inclusive financial sector for MSMEs, promoting a conducive policy and regulatory environment for credit guarantees. The act aims to boost MSMEs’ access to quality and affordable credit, thereby enhancing their economic participation. Speaking at a public participation forum in Garissa, Antony Njeru, a Principal Economist at the State Department for MSME at the National Treasury, said that Credit guarantee companies who will be licensed by the Central Bank of Kenya will work with lending institutions to guarantee loans for small and medium business owners. Due to the moral hazard that people may fail to repay the loans when guaranteed by the government, the banks will look at the credit scores of those seeking financing and determine whether to involve the credit guarantors or not. According to Njeru, the banks will judge if a client can be able to repay a loan or not, and those that the banks think that they may have difficulties in repaying are the ones to be referred to credit guarantee companies. “SMEs have been having a challenge to access loans from banks. This policy will create a Kenya Credit Guarantee Company, which will guarantee business communities who are seeking loans from the banks. This will help those who have low credit scores,” Njeru said. Meanwhile, MSMEs contribute 34% to Kenya’s GDP and employ over 16 million Kenyans. Credit access aims to boost their monthly earnings to Sh50,000. According to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the financing gap for MSMEs in Kenya is about Kshs.4 trillion, out of which banks will lend only Kshs.783.3 billion in 2022. The majority of MSMEs heavily depend on loans from informal sources such as chamas, family, and friends, with very low reliance on formal sources such as commercial banks, SACCOs, and microfinance institutions. Garissa County Commissioner Mohamed Mwabudzo, who officiated the forum, said that the government has created a conducive environment for businesses to grow through various financing options, such as the Hustler Fund, the Youth Fund, and the and the Uwezo Fund, among others. Thus, he encouraged MSMEs to take advantage of these facilities to grow their businesses and contribute to the growth of the national economy.",

        "description": "More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says.",
        "content": "Cairo: Israeli tanks reached the centre of Rafah for the first time on Tuesday, witnesses said, three weeks into a ground operation in the southern Gaza city that has sparked global condemnation. The tanks were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a central Rafah landmark, the witnesses told Reuters. The Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in the Rafah area without commenting on reported advancements into the city centre. Overnight, its forces pounded the city with airstrikes and tank fire, residents said, pressing its offensive despite an international outcry over an attack on Sunday that sparked a blaze in a tent camp, killing at least 45 Palestinians, more than half of them children, women and the elderly. Since that strike, at least 26 more people have been killed by Israeli fire in Rafah, officials in the enclave run by Hamas militants said. Israeli tanks pushed towards western neighbourhoods and took positions on the Zurub hilltop in western Rafah in one of the worst nights of bombardment reported by residents. On Tuesday, witnesses reported gunbattle between Israeli troops and Hamas-led fighters in the Zurub area. Witnesses in Rafah said the Israeli military appeared to have brought in remote-operated armoured vehicles and there was no immediate sign of personnel in or around them. An Israeli military spokesperson had no immediate response. Since Israel launched its incursion by taking control of the border crossing with Egypt three weeks ago, tanks had probed around the edges of Rafah and entered some of its eastern districts but had not yet entered the city in full force. Reacting to Sunday night's attack in a camp where families displaced from assaults elsewhere in Gaza had sought shelter, global leaders urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault. Residents said the Tel Al-Sultan area, the scene of Sunday's deadly strike, was still being heavily bombarded. \"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,\" one resident told Reuters over a chat app. Around one million people have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday. Israel has kept up attacks despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing that the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there. Spain, Ireland and Norway will officially recognise a Palestinian state on Tuesday, despite an angry reaction from Israel, which has found itself increasingly isolated after more than seven months of conflict in Gaza. The three nations have painted their decision as a way to speed efforts to secure a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas. More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.",

        "content": "Etihad Airways has signed a deal to become main sponsor of Spanish La Liga football club, Girona from next season. Etihad has grown its Spanish operation by nearly 50% since last summer as 2024 sees the airline operate 10 weekly flights to both Madrid and Barcelona. In addition, the airline has introduced seasonal flights, operating three times a week to Málaga starting on 2 June, further enhancing travel and tourism between the regions. “We are thrilled to partner with Girona FC, a club that resonates with our brand values and aspirations.

        "description": "A five year-old football team based in North Lanarkshire has received significant investment from America after smashing a fundraising target.",
        "content": "A Scottish lowland league football team has smashed a summer fundraising target by raising $1 million with the help of investors across the world . The owner of Caledonian Braves, a five-year-old football club from the fifth tier of the Scottish football pyramid, set out to attract investors from across the globe by presenting everyone who donated the chance to be an owner of the club. Anyone who donated $100 or more would become a part owner of the Caledonian Braves. The initial target for fundraising was £750,000, with the aim of raising the full amount by the end of July this year, but it has since been smashed well ahead of the deadline. It now means the team can look to put some of the $1m -which equates to just over £780,000 - back into the club to increase its chances of reaching the Scottish Professional Football League, after they finished 12th in the Lowland League this season. Owner Chris Ewing said: “Our manager, Ricky Waddell, has already made his pitch for a bigger player budget for next season and it’s natural that we would want to invest some of the money raised into improving the squad. “Ultimately, we want to continue our journey into the SPFL but we want to do it responsibly, and by staying true to our vision and values as a community club with fans at the heart of our decision-making. “We have big plans for the club and the recent investment will help us take significant strides forward in terms of the playing squad, but also infrastructural improvements off the field. More importantly, we now have more than 3000 owners who believe in that vision and want to play an active part in getting us there.” READ MORE: Caledonian Braves raises $250,000 in crowdfunding drive Abdallah Sima opens up on possibility of return to Rangers Kyogo gives verdict on possible Celtic return for Adam Idah The idea for the fundraiser came from Mr Ewing, and it attracted new shareholders of the club from the NBA, NFL and the National Women’s Soccer League in the United States. The owner says the club can now also claim the distinction of having owners in each of the 50 states of America. Shareholders now include Isaiah Covington (Strength and Conditioning Coach, Boston Celtics), ⁠Mujtaba Elgoodah (NBA Players Services), Kristen Hamilton, Elizabeth Ball and Hailie Mace (Kansas City Women’s), ⁠Tide Osifeso (Basketball Operations, Utah Jazz), ⁠Ryan Rollins (Point Guard, Washington Wizards), Kevin Abrams (Senior Vice President Football Operations, NY Giants), and Dean Whitehouse (NASA). Established in 2019, the North Lanarkshire-based club has put fan interaction at the heart of decision-making since day one, with the name being chosen through a fan opinion poll. They have since used app-based technology and fan interaction to make decisions from boardroom to dressing room – including naming their stadium, Alliance Park in Motherwell, approving new kits, and agreeing on the strategic priorities for the board. Mr Ewing said the new investment is a victory for the everyday football fan and hopes to partly emulate the likes of Wrexham FC who are on a mission to rise through the leagues in England after Hollywood A-listers Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney bought them. He said: “The idea of the Braves was simple: we are a small fish in Scottish football but in the digital age there are no boundaries to get involved and play a part in the running of a club. “We wanted to create a club for everyone, wherever they are, to play a meaningful role in – for as little as $100 you could be an owner of a football club. That has appealed to fans of all ages and in all corners of the world. “We wanted to buck the trend of needing to have billions of pounds or a private equity firm to have a say in the running of a club. We wanted to put the fan at the heart of everything we do. “The response has been terrific, but I always had confidence in our vision. It shows if you build the right format, people will come and not just be a part of it but play an active part in it.”",

        "content": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes on Rafah have killed at least 16 Palestinians, first responders said Tuesday, as residents reported an escalation of fighting in the southern Gaza city. An Israeli incursion launched in early May has caused nearly 1 million to flee from Rafah, most of whom have already been displaced in the war between Israel and Hamas , and who are now seeking refuge in squalid tent camps and war-ravaged areas. The United States and other close allies of Israel have warned against a full-fledged offensive in the city, with the Biden administration saying it would cross a red line and refusing to provide offensive arms for such an undertaking. On Friday, the International Court of Justice called on Israel to halt its Rafah offensive , an order it has no power to enforce. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead, saying Israeli forces must go into Rafah in order to dismantle Hamas and return hostages taken in the Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war. The latest strikes occurred in the same area where Israel targeted what it said was a Hamas compound on Sunday night. That strike ignited a fire in a camp for displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local health officials, sparking worldwide outrage. Netanyahu said there was a “tragic mishap\" on Sunday and the military said it was investigating. Strikes overnight killed a total of 16 people in the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood in northwest Rafah, according to the Palestinian Civil Defense and the Palestinian Red Crescent. Israel says it is carrying out limited operations in eastern Rafah along the Gaza-Egypt border. But residents reported heavy bombardment overnight in western parts of Rafah as well. “It was a night of horror,” said Abdel-Rahman Abu Ismail, a Palestinian from Gaza City who has been sheltering in Tel al-Sultan since December. He said he heard “constant sounds” of explosions overnight and into Tuesday morning, with fighter jets and drones flying over the area. He said it reminded him of the Israeli invasion of of his neighborhood of Shijaiyah in Gaza City, where Israel launched a heavy bombing campaign before sending in ground forces in late 2023. “We saw this before,” he said. Sayed al-Masri, a Rafah resident, said many families have been forced to flee their homes and shelters, with most heading for the crowded Mawasi area, where giant tent camps have been set up on a barren coastline, or to Khan Younis, a southern city that suffered heavy damage during months of fighting. “The situation is worsening” in Rafah, al-Masri said. Gaza’s Health Ministry said two medical facilities in Tel al-Sultan have been taken out of service because of intense bombing nearby. Medical Aid for Palestinians, a charity operating throughout the territory, said the Tel al-Sultan medical center and the Indonesian Field Hospital were under lockdown, with medics, patients and displaced people trapped inside. Most of Gaza's hospitals are no longer functioning . The Kuwait Hospital in Rafah shut down Monday after a strike near its entrance killed two health workers. The war began when Hamas and other militants burst into southern Israel in a surprise attack on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 civilians and abducting around 250. More than 100 were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Israel responded to the Oct. 7 attack with a massive air, land and sea offensive that has killed over 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry , which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. Around 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million has been displaced and United Nations officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . ___ Magdy reported from Cairo. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war",

        "content": "MADRID: Spain and Norway on Tuesday formally recognised a Palestinian state, with Ireland due to follow suit, in a decision slammed by Israel as a \"reward\" for Hamas, more than seven months into the devastating Gaza war. The three European countries believe their initiative has strong symbolic impact that is likely to encourage others to follow suit. As Oslo's formal recognition went into effect, Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide hailed the move as \"a special day for Norway-Palestine relations\". \"Norway has been one of the most fervent defenders of a Palestinian state for more than 30 years,\" he added. Shortly afterwards, Spain followed suit, with government spokeswoman Pilar Alegria confirming the cabinet had formally recognised Palestinian statehood, qualifying it as \"a historic day\". Earlier, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said such recognition was \"an essential requirement\" for peace, insisting the move was \"not against anyone, least of all Israel\" and was the only way to secure a future \"Palestinian state living side-by-side with the state of Israel in peace and security\". The decision also reflected Spain's \"outright rejection of Hamas, which is against the two-state solution\" and whose October 7 attacks led to the Gaza war, he added. Ahead of his own cabinet meeting, Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris said it was \"an important moment\" that sent a signal \"that there are practical actions you can take as a country to help keep the hope... of a two-state solution alive\". The plans were unveiled last week by the prime ministers of the three countries, sparking a furious response from Israel, further exacerbating diplomatic tensions, notably with Spain. Last week, Sanchez's far-left deputy Yolanda Diaz hailed the move saying: \"We cannot stop. Palestine will be free from the river to the sea\", which Israel's Madrid envoy denounced as a \"clear call for the elimination of Israel\". The slogan refers to the British mandate borders of Palestine, which stretched from the River Jordan to the Mediterranean before Israel was created in 1948. On Tuesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz went even further. \"Sanchez, as long as you don't fire your deputy and you recognise a Palestinian state, you are participating in the incitement to commit genocide and war crimes against the Jewish people,\" he wrote on X. On Sunday, Katz posted a video on X splicing footage of the October 7 attacks with flamenco dancing, saying: \"Sanchez: Hamas thanks you for your service.\" Spain condemned the post as \"scandalous and revolting\". On Monday, Katz initiated the first of a series of \"preliminary punitive measures\", ordering Spain's Jerusalem consulate to stop offering consular services to Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. Recognising Palestinian statehood has provoked sharp disagreement within the 27-nation European Union. For decades, formal recognition of a Palestinian state has been seen as the endgame of a negotiated peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Washington and most Western European nations have said they are willing to one day recognise Palestinian statehood, but not before agreement on thorny issues like the status of Jerusalem and final borders. The Gaza bloodshed has revived calls for Palestinians to be given their own state. Tuesday's move will mean 145 of the United Nations' 193 member states now recognise Palestinian statehood. In 2014, Sweden became the first EU member to recognise a Palestinian state. It followed six other European countries that took the step before joining the bloc: Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania. On October 7, Hamas fighters stormed into southern Israel in an assault that killed more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza. The Israeli army says 37 of them are dead. Israel's relentless retaliatory offensive has killed more than 36,000 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.",

        "description": "The latest strikes occurred in the same area where Israel targeted what it said was a Hamas compound on Sunday night.",
        "content": "An Israeli incursion launched in early May has caused nearly one million to flee from Rafah, most of whom have already been displaced in the war between Israel and Hamas, and who are now seeking refuge in squalid tent camps and war-ravaged areas. The latest strikes occurred in the same area where Israel targeted what it said was a Hamas compound on Sunday night. That strike ignited a fire in a camp for displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local health officials, sparking worldwide outrage. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there was a “tragic mishap” on Sunday and the military said it was investigating. Strikes overnight killed a total of 16 people in the Tel al-Sultan neighbourhood in north-west Rafah, according to the Palestinian Civil Defence and the Palestinian Red Crescent. Israel says it is carrying out limited operations in eastern Rafah along the Gaza-Egypt border. But residents reported heavy bombardment overnight in western parts of Rafah as well. “It was a night of horror,” said Abdel-Rahman Abu Ismail, a Palestinian from Gaza City who has been sheltering in Tel al-Sultan since December. He said he heard “constant sounds” of explosions overnight and into Tuesday morning, with fighter jets and drones flying over the area. He said it reminded him of the Israeli invasion of of his neighbourhood of Shijaiyah in Gaza City, where Israel launched a heavy bombing campaign before sending in ground forces in late 2023. “We saw this before,” he said. Sayed al-Masri, a Rafah resident, said many families have been forced to flee their homes and shelters, with most heading for the crowded area of Mawasi, where giant tent camps have been set up on a barren coastline, or to Khan Younis, a southern city that suffered heavy damage during months of fighting. “The situation is worsening” in Rafah, Mr al-Masri said. The war began when Hamas and other militants burst into southern Israel in a surprise attack on October 7, killing some 1,200 civilians and abducting around 250 others. More than 100 were released during a ceasefire in November in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Israel responded to the October 7 attack with a massive air, land and sea offensive that has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. Around 80% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million has been displaced and parts of the territory are experiencing famine. Mr Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he says are Hamas’s last remaining battalions in Rafah. The US and other close allies have warned Israel against carrying out a full-fledged ground offensive in the city, saying it could cause a humanitarian catastrophe.",

        "description": "STUDENTS from a Wirral school went international during three exciting school trips.",
        "content": "Students at St Mary’s Catholic College, Wallasey, recently got the opportunity to visit three international destinations as part of their educational studies. The first of the three trips was a visit to Poland. Completed in a single day and organised by St Mary’s head of history, Ms Stoneley, the trip was part of a wider project that three Year 13 students are undertaking with the Holocaust Educational Trust. Ahead of the trip, students attended two online seminars where they learned about pre-war Jewish life, the Holocaust, and they even had the opportunity to meet with a Holocaust survivor. The project will help students explore the contemporary relevance of the Holocaust and enable them to become ambassadors for the Holocaust Education Trust so they can disseminate the lessons learned in school and the wider community. Students visited the site of the Great Synagogue, destroyed in 1939, the Auschwitz Memorial and Museum, and the Auschwitz Birkenau site. The second trip saw students visit Morocco as part of their French and Geography studies. A total of 30 students and four staff members embarked on a cultural visit to the North African country. Organised by the school’s head of humanities, Mrs New, and head of French, Mr Le Normand, the trip was an opportunity for students to visit St Mary’s partner school, Anoushka Elite School, and immerse themselves in the Moroccan culture. After a short stay in Casablanca, where students got a glimpse at the third biggest mosque in the world, Hassan II, they headed to their destination, Asilah – the bluest city in the Northwest of Morocco. Students got the opportunity to attend shared Arabic, French literature and drama classes as part of an academic programme. Students were welcomed by Anoushka Elite School’s staff and students alike and quickly built strong friendships that will undoubtedly continue. After exploring the picturesque beaches and local landmarks, students attended the Lixusarchaeological site, the oldest Roman settlement in Northern Africa. The trip concluded with students journeying back to Casablanca to continue their cultural experience and enjoy the delicacies of Morocco. The third and final trip saw 44 students and five staff members head to the slopes of Pila, Italy. After collecting their ski equipment, the students and staff headed to the mountain to meet their ski instructor. Located in the Aosta Valley, known as the most panoramic balcony in the Alps, students explored the ski school of Pila where they got the opportunity to ski on several different slopes. Throughout the week, students demonstrated determination and showcased their maturity as they navigated the slopes and improved their ski abilities. During the evenings, students got the chance to participate in a variety is après ski activities, including bowling, quizzes and an evening meal at a local pizzeria. On the final evening of the trip students were awarded certificates from ski instructors who shared praised them for their determination, courage and compassion for one another. Headteacher at St Mary’s Catholic College, Mr Kevin Maddocks, said: “International trips are a fantastic way to offer our students the chance to experience new cultures and gain a deeper understanding of the world around them. “Cultural experiences enable students to engage with artistic, social and philosophical activities that embody different communities. “Through international opportunities with our partner schools and other organisations, we support students to embrace new opportunities. Each of the students on both trips represented our school incredibly, and we are extremely proud. The trip to Morocco was partly funded by the Turing Scheme and the impact on the young people has been immense.”",

        "content": "Lengthy wait times at the pedestrian crossing lights near Glencar Shopping Centre have been fixed, much to the relief of local families. Councillor Jimmy Kavanagh brought the issue to the attention of the council in May, expressing concerns about children’s safety due to the extended wait times. “The lights could take up to four minutes to change,” Cllr. Kavanagh told the council meeting. “P arents are very worried about this as the road is very busy, and children tend to take their chances and just run across rather than wait for the lights to change, and they are afraid that a child will be knocked down and injured.” With the summer holidays approaching, Cllr. Kavanagh emphasized the urgency of addressing the problem. The council’s engineers have since acted on the issue and Cllr. Kavanagh has been informed that the traffic lights have been adjusted and are functioning properly. “The lights have been adjusted and are working as they should without a long delay in changing to allow pedestrians to cross,” Cllr Kavanagh said. “I would like to thank the council for getting this seen to quickly.”",

        "content": "PARIS: Let’s get this part out of the way: Rafael Nadal did not announce his retirement after exiting the French Open in the first round. Nothing else, though, is entirely clear about what comes next for the owner of 22 Grand Slam titles. He turns 38 in a week and has been dealing with injuries for quite some time. “I don’t know,” Nadal acknowledged, “what’s going to happen in the next few months.” He probably won’t be back at the tournament where he’s collected a record 14 trophies, but write that in pencil, because he would not completely rule out the possibility in the days leading up to, or the moments immediately following, the 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 loss to Alexander Zverev at Roland Garros on Monday that gave the Spaniard the first losing streak of his career on clay courts. He probably won’t enter Wimbledon, because it just doesn’t seem like a good idea to switch to grass right now, although he would not completely rule that out, either. As for the Paris Olympics, which will hold the tennis competition at Roland Garros starting in two months? He probably will be there, but — hey, here’s a twist — he wouldn’t completely commit to that. So in sum, all we really know about what the future holds for Nadal is that we don’t really know a thing about what the future holds for him. Which, of course, is OK, because he is allowed to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, however he wants. “Obviously,” Zverev observed, “there are uncertainties.” Obviously. “That’s why I am not saying I am retiring today,” said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old child, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother’s lap at Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday. “In terms of what’s driving me ... I’m a simple guy. I enjoy what I do. I am passionate about sport, I am passionate about competition. I like to practice, I like to play tennis. I’m in a different moment of my personal life, too, traveling with my son, wife. I am enjoying these moments that will not come back.” So, basically, why force himself to stop? Why not try to see how much more his body can take? Why not hope to stay out there, doing what he’s done so well for so long, and maybe just give himself and his family — particularly his kid, still too young to remember what is happening yet — some memories to hold onto one day? “If I keep enjoying doing what I am doing and I feel myself competitive and healthy enough to enjoy, I want to keep going for a while,” Nadal explained. “I don’t know for how long, but I want to keep going for a while, because they are having fun, I am having fun, and I need to see — I need to give myself a little bit longer ... to see if my level is growing and my body is holding, and then let’s make a decision.” Makes perfect sense. Especially considering what both opponents took away from this latest performance, which was hardly up to Nadal’s career-long standards but did include the occasional patch of play that might have been good enough to get past a lesser obstacle than Zverev. The 27-year-old German is, after all, ranked No. 4, was the runner-up at the U.S. Open four years ago and the gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago. Plus, he is coming off a clay title at the Italian Open and has been a semifinalist at Roland Garros each of the past three years. “I mean, I was not that far,” Nadal said. “That’s my feeling.” Zverev’s assessment: “If he stays healthy, he’s going to continue playing better.” Nadal sounded as though he agreed with that. He also asked for some time to make up his mind. “Give me two months ‘til the Olympics, and then let’s see if I am able to keep going or I say, ’OK, guys, it’s more than enough.’ Let’s see,” Nadal said Monday evening, after only his fourth loss in 116 French Open matches. “I mean, today is not a moment to analyze all these kind of things.”",

        "description": "A SCOTTISH bar has been named as the second best in the world by a prestigious food and drink guide.",
        "content": "Popular US-based magazine Food and Wine has shared its latest roundup of the top bars across the globe with just 11 venues making it onto the elite list. Panda and Sons in Edinburgh came in second place, the Scottish Daily Express reports with the stylish pub popular amongst locals and visitors alike. READ MORE: Ayrshire: Planning submitted for £150m redevelopment of marine yard It features a wide array of cocktails inspired by destinations from around the world. Dating back to 2013, Panda and Sons was created by award-winning bartender Iain McPherson and his family. Food and Wine commented: “Entry instructions – find the barbershop run by a pair of well-coiffed pandas and slip into the back – at this Edinburgh speakeasy are slightly silly. “These more mischievous elements complement a serious triumph of process, as Panda and Sons owner Iain McPherson is one of the world’s leading experts on freezing techniques. “He’s responsible for inventing a method of cold infusion called ‘switching,’ in which water is removed from a spirit and replaced with something more flavourful. “As such, classic cocktails have a technical touch, like an Appletini (olive oil -washed vodka, clarified apple, umeshu and Calvados) or the creamy colada with cocoa butter-washed rum.” Topping the list was Ben Fiddich in Japan which, despite its Scottish-sounding name, only has connections to the country through its whisky . Behind Panda and Sons in third place is Little Red Doors in Paris while Maybe Sammy in Sydney and Alquimico in Cartagena round out the top five. Completing the list are Himok in Oslo, Handshake Speakeasy in Mexico City, Atlas in Singapore, Sips in Barcelona, La Sala de Laura in Bogota and Plus: Baba Au Rum in Athens.",

        "description": "TEHRAN (Tasnim) – The UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) in its latest report revealed a considerable growth in the arrival of foreign tourists in Iran last year, saying that about six million foreign tourists visited the country in 2023.",
        "content": "The arrival of the foreign tourists in Iran in 2023 registered a 43% growth compared to a year earlier, the international body reported. Last year, 5.9 million foreign tourists visited Iran, while 4.1 million foreign tourists had visited the country in 2022, the report added. The 43% increase in foreign tourist arrivals in 2023 came just a year after Iran’s tourism industry was revived following the easing of the global coronavirus pandemic. The international body put the number of foreign tourists who visited Iran in 2021 at 880,000. With the rise in the arrival of foreign tourists, Iran’s rank has significantly improved in the world in this respect. While Iran stood in the 40 place in the world in terms of the number of foreign tourists in 2022, it rose to 34 place in 2023. Accordingly, only 33 countries in the world attracted more foreign tourists than Iran in 2023. France ranked first in the world by attracting 100 million foreign tourists, followed by Spain and the United States.",

        "description": "During labour, Charlie’s heartbeat dropped each time his mum Chelsea had a contraction",
        "content": "A baby was left unable to breathe and swallow after being born with a rare birth condition. Charlie Dutch was born at Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow on April 4 this year. During labour, Charlie’s heartbeat dropped each time his mum Chelsea had a contraction, resulting in a caesarean section delivery. Suffering breathing difficulties during delivery, Charlie was immediately taken to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The NICU medical team made an unsuccessful attempt to pass a breathing tube down Charlie’s throat, with an x-ray revealing that it had coiled. Charlie was then diagnosed with oesophageal atresia (OA) and tracheo-oesophageal fistula (TOF) a condition which had caused his oesophagus to not be joined to his stomach, preventing him from swallowing and food reaching his stomach. Read more: The disused Essex railway station once part of London Underground Read more: Map shows Essex areas with huge changes to boundaries for the 2024 General Election vote The couple had barely seen their newborn son, but Charlie required specialist surgical treatment to correct both the OA and TOF conditions, which would need to take place at The Rosie Hospital in Cambridge. Paul travelled with Charlie in the ambulance as he was taken to Cambridge but with Chelsea still recovering from her own surgery, she was unable to join them until she was discharged. Charlie underwent surgery when he was just one day old and whilst the surgical team were successful in correcting the TOF, the attempt to correct the OA wasn’t fully successful. Charlie will need another surgery in late June to stretch and reattach his oesophagus to his stomach. Being many miles from home, Paul was able to spend the first night in temporary accommodation at the hospital. However, while Charlie was being prepared for surgery, the nurses told him he could stay at Chestnut House, a ‘Home from Home’ ran by The Sick Children’s Trust. After being discharged Cheslea was able to join Paul at Chestnut House, staying there for three weeks while Charlie recovered from his initial surgery. While Charlie remains on the NICU at The Rosie Hospital, being fed by a tube directly into his stomach, Paul and Chelsea made the selfless decision to leave Chestnut House so another family can be supported by the ‘Home from Home’. Chelsea and Paul now visit the hospital to see Charlie daily whilst he awaits his next surgery. To thank the charity for its support whilst they stayed at Chestnut House Paul is now fundraising through various challenges. He said: “By the time Charlie was going for his surgery I’d barely slept over the last two days. I was completely alone in Cambridge with nothing with me. Being able to stay at the hospital and then at Chestnut House was vital so we could be there for our son. “As first-time parents having your newborn son rushed to a different hospital and undergoing surgery at a day old was really worrying. Thanks to the support of Chestnut House we could be with Charlie at any time of day or night as the ‘Home from Home’ is located within the hospital, just a few floors beneath Charlie’s ward. “With Charlie being stable and not having any surgeries for the time being we made the decision to leave Chestnut House so another family can benefit from the charity’s support. The ‘Homes from Home’ are in such high demand and for now we can make the journey from Harlow.\" Paul is now taking on a series of challenges to raise funds for The Sick Children’s Trust as the charity that supported him while his newborn son was having surgery to correct a rare birth condition. Paul began his fundraising by taking on a 10,000ft skydive on May 25 before he takes part in the charity’s Long Ride Home challenge, cycling 370 miles throughout the month of June. Paul wanted to raise money to thank the charity for supporting him and his partner, Chelsea, while their son Charlie has been receiving vital care at The Rosie Hospital in Cambridge. He said: “It was such an incredible support for us that I wanted to do something to give back to the charity. \"The Sick Children’s Trust do not charge any of the families they support but it does cost the charity £40 to support a family for a night. I want to raise as much as possible for them and thought by taking on two challenges, including a cycle from Harlow to Cambridge, rather than one would encourage more donations! I’ve always wanted to do a skydive so while I’ll be nervous on the day it will be a great experience so I’m looking forward to it.” More information about Paul’s fundraising can be found on his Just Giving page https://www.justgiving.com/page/paul-dutch-1713197857399",

        "content": "NEW DELHI: The former head of Israel's foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad , allegedly intimidated an international criminal court chief prosecutor in an attempt to persuade her to drop a war crimes probe, the Guardian reported. Yossi Cohencontactedthe ICC 's then-prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda , in a series of secret meetings in the years preceding her decision to launch a formal investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the occupied Palestinian territories. That inquiry, which began in 2021, concluded last week when Bensouda's successor Karim Khan stated that he was seeking an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the country's conduct in the Gaza war. “You should help us and let us take care of you. You don’t want to be getting into things that could compromise your security or that of your family,” Cohen reportedly told Bensouda as per the accounts shared by ICC officials, the Guardian reported. Calling Cohen's act as that of using \"despicable tactics\" and “stalking”, two ICC officials said that the Mossad was also interested in Bensouda's family members and got transcripts of secret recordings of her husband. Responding to these allegations, a representative for Israel's prime minister's office told the Guardian, \"The questions forwarded to us are replete with many false and unfounded allegations meant to hurt the state of Israel.\" These revelations came inas the current chief prosecutor, Khan, warned in recent days that he will not hesitate to prosecute \"attempts to impede, intimidate, or improperly influence\" ICC staff. According to legal experts and former ICC officials, the Mossad's efforts to intimidate or put pressure on Bensouda may constitute crimes against the administration of justice under article 70 of the Rome statute, the treaty that founded the court.",

Toyota’s said the “engine is optimized for the electrification era” with hopes of helping push the world into “carbon neutrality.” Toyota already has a well-known hybrid car — the — with a gas engine and an electric motor. It switches between the two to deliver a cleaner drive. In future hybrids, the electric motor is set to become the main driving power, and the new engine will be designed to take a lesser role and help it along, according to Toyota. Domestic allies Subaru Corp. and , both preparing ecological engines designed to meet the inevitably upcoming stringent emissions standards, joined ‘s presentation billed as a “multi-pathway workshop.” “Each company wants to win, but we can be faster if we work together,” said Sato. But details on when the engines were coming to market weren’t disclosed. The legacy of the car engine could be felt everywhere. Mazda said that its prized rotary engine, introduced more than 50 years ago, was being adapted for electric vehicles. Subaru, meanwhile, showcased its trademark smaller horizontally opposed engine. While Chief Technology Officer Tetsuro Fujinuki confirmed the company was working on a great “Subaru-like” electric vehicle, he said the company wasn’t about to dump the engine altogether. Toyota, too, is . The executives said Tuesday that energy supply conditions differed globally, adding that products had to meet various customer needs and the investments needed for mass-producing BEVS were enormous. Toyota officials also repeatedly noted that 5.5 million jobs were at stake in the overall supply chain for vehicle production in Japan nowadays, so a sudden shift to electric cars wasn’t economically possible or socially responsible. Takahiro Fujimoto, a professor of business at Waseda University, believes electric vehicles are a key solution for reducing emissions. But they still have weak points, such as large amounts of emissions produced while making lithium-ion batteries, a chief component. In Japan, for instance, commuters use trains, so that may be a better ecological choice for transportation, Fujimoto said. “At the very least, I believe the proliferation of and innovations in BEVs are definitely needed. But that argument is logically not the same as saying that all we need are BEVs,” he said. Uncertainties remain, spanning research and development, as well as social, political and market conditions, said Fujimoto. “The carbon neutrality the world is aspiring toward isn’t likely attainable for decades to come. It’s going to be a long marathon race,” he said. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on X: Yuri Kageyama, The Associated Press",

        "content": "Fans of the Tom Cruise-led Mission: Impossible franchise are in for another wait as the highly anticipated eighth instalment faces an unexpected delay. This time, the setback occurred when a Rs 250 crore submarine encountered a malfunction during filming, significantly impacting the movie's budget. According to Mirror UK reports, the gimbal responsible for lowering the 120-foot submarine malfunctioned under its substantial weight, necessitating immediate repairs and bringing production to a temporary standstill. Sources close to the production reveal that the repairs have pushed back the filming schedule by several weeks, further inflating the already staggering budget. The overall budget is now estimated to be nearing Rs 3,324.88 crore. Expressing frustration, an insider from the production team highlighted the significant financial implications of each day's delay. \"They’re not happy as it puts production behind, which costs a lot of money per day,\" the source stated. Currently, repairs are underway and are expected to take a few weeks to complete, prolonging the wait for eager fans anticipating the next thrilling instalment of the Mission: Impossible series.",

        "description": "The law contains a clause titled 'contempt of the legislature', which experts believe would lead to punitive measures including punishments for those who don't cooperate with questioning",
        "content": "The Taiwan Legislature on Tuesday passed a controversial bill that would significantly curtail the powers of the president. The contentious bill was made into a law despite widespread protests by Taiwanese people. Taiwan got a new president earlier this month in the form of Lai Ching-te, whose ruling Democratic Progressive Party and leaders from the Opposition engaged in a scuffle in the parliament over the controversial bill. The skirmish was so intense that an Opposition leader’s T-shirt got ripped during a debate. Meanwhile, a large number of protestors have been gathering in Taipei to prevent the passage of the bill but their efforts proved futile. Notably, these protests are the biggest the island nation has seen since 2014’s Sunflower student movement when protestors stormed the parliament to block the passage of a trade pact with China. What is the contentious law? The Law Governing the Legislative Yuan’s Power will effectively grant lawmakers the power to question, demand, or investigate personal documents of any government official, military general, the general public and even the president. The president could also be summoned by legislators for questioning at any point in time, a provision that will also be applied to the common man and companies. It will also give leaders access to confidential documents. How is the law harmful to Taiwan’s democracy? The law contains a clause titled “contempt of the legislature”, which experts believe would lead to punitive measures including punishments for those who don’t cooperate with questioning. The law is backed by the two main opposition parties, the Kuomintang and Taiwan People’s Party. Many have even expressed concerns that the power that the law extends to legislators would derail President Lai’s agenda and leak sensitive information, threatening Taiwan’s national security. Austin Wang, a US-based political scientist specialising in Taiwanese politics, told Al Jazeera , “In the bill, the legislators can ask the military to hand in sensitive information, which is problematic since some legislators have been accused of leaking information to China. There is no check-and-balance under this investigation any more.”",

        "content": "Newly submitted plans would see a former secondary school torn down to make way for a huge new housing development. Proposals have been put forward to by Eutopia Homes for the construction of 139 new dwellings at the site of the former St John Fisher Catholic Comprehensive School on Ordnance Street in . The site, which dates back to the 1960s, became disused in early 2023 when St John Fisher School moved all of its operations to a single-site school on City Way, Rochester. In October last year, , triggering a large emergency service response including 40 firefighters. Under the recently submitted plans, the multiple buildings that made up the school would be completely demolished to make way for the new housing. Then a mixture of one to four-bedroom dwellings would be constructed, with two four-storey apartment blocks included in the proposals. These would be joined by a mixture of two and three-storey terraced houses and 10 per cent of the units are to be designed as wheelchair accessible or adaptable. Each of the terraced houses would include their own private gardens under the plans. A total of 70 car parking spaces would accommodate the development, with the majority of the town houses to be allocated one parking space. No dedicated car parking is proposed for the apartment complexes, however. Cycle storage will be provided throughout, with bike storage at the rear of the town houses and internal cycle storage within the flat blocks. The north west corner of the development would be used for a large public open space, while a ‘Biodiversity Zone’ will run along the perimeter of the southern section of the site, though this will not be accessible to residents. Street trees would line the main road through the centre of the development. Meanwhile, the apartment blocks would feature green roofs in order to ‘further promote sustainability’. Vehicular access to the site will be retained from Charles Street and a new access road will also be created between Ordnance Street and Perry Street. Medway Council is yet to make a decision on these proposals and the plans can be found in full on the with reference MC/24/1033.",

        "content": "NEW DELHI: French citizens are planning a protest against the government's £1.2 billion state-backed plan to clean up the Seine River in Paris for the 2024 Olympic Games . The protest, dubbed a mass \" defecation flashmob ,\" is scheduled to take place on the day President Emmanuel Macron and Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo are set to swim in the river to promote its cleanliness, as reported by The Metro. The hashtag #JeChieDansLaSeineLe23Juin, which translates to 'I sh*t in the Seine on June 23', gained traction on X last week following the announcement of the swim date. A website with the same name was created, allowing participants to enter their planned defecation locations. The campaign's slogan reads, 'Because after putting us in sh*t it is up to them to bathe in our sh*t.' Social media has been inundated with memes, including an AI-generated image depicting toilets installed along the Seine's banks by 'the City of Paris' to counter the operation, and a fake picture showing the French president standing on a bridge over the feces-covered river. The protest comes amidst ongoing efforts to clean up the Seine for swimming, as was the case during the 1900 Paris Olympics. However, a sewer problem in the summer of 2023 led to the cancellation of a pre-Olympics swimming event. When asked if he would swim in the Seine, Macron said, 'You bet I will,' but refrained from disclosing the date to avoid attracting attention. Olympic open water and triathlon events are planned to take place in the river during the Paris 2024 Games. However, the French nonprofit Surfrider suggests that more work may be necessary to make certain sections of the Seine swimmable by July, as campaigners have found 'concentrations of enterococci and E. coli' in the river. Dr Leon Davis, senior lecturer in marketing and events management at Teesside University in Middlesbrough, England, told Metro.co.uk that the Seine will be the biggest challenge for the games, especially as the opening ceremony will break tradition by not being held at the stadium.",

        "content": "BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei - President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. on Tuesday raised to Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah the need for nation-states to cooperate amid geopolitical tensions in the region. During his meeting with the oil-rich sultanate ruler, Marcos said the “landscape of our region and of the world is changing in fundamental ways.” “The challenges brought by climate change, environmental degradation, and geopolitical tensions find it necessary for nation-states to cooperate more closely and more effectively,” Marcos said. “I am therefore honored to discuss the state of our countries’ relations, as well as exchange views on regional and international developments with the world's longest-reigning current monarch and the longest-serving current head of state,” he added. Marcos further acknowledged Brunei’s assistance to the Philippines, especially during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic when it donated test kits and vaccines to the country. Brunei also helped the victims of Super Typhoon Yolanda and Typhoon Odette, according to Marcos. The President also thanked Brunei for its help to the Philippines during the oil crises in the 1970s. For his part, Bolkiah expressed gratitude to Marcos for accepting his invitation to visit Brunei as he emphasized that the latter’s state visit is customary to both countries. “I’m looking forward to further enhancing our friendship in areas of future interest, which I believe will greatly benefit our countries and people,” Bolkiah told Marcos. After 40 years, another Marcos has gone to Brunei to further strengthen the bilateral relationship between the Philippines and the Sultanate. To recall, late President Ferdinand Marcos Sr., accompanied by his son, travelled to Brunei on February 23, 1984 for a state visit to establish diplomatic relations with the Sultanate. —LDF, GMA Integrated News",

        "content": "Rachel Reeves has effectively ruled out an emergency Budget in the summer if Labour wins the General Election . The Shadow Chancellor said that, if she enters the Treasury, there will be \"no additional tax rises\" beyond the ones she has already set out. Ms Reeves, who has vowed not to hike national insurance or income tax, also promised never to \"play fast and loose with the public finances\". Asked whether she would hold an emergency Budget if the party wins power, she said: \"The OBR [Office for Budget requires 10 weeks' notice to provide an independent forecast ahead of a Budget and I've been really clear that I would not deliver a fiscal event without an OBR forecast\". It means Labour's first major statement on the economy if the party wins power may not come until September at the earliest. In her first major speech of the General Election campaign, Ms Reeves, who could become the first female Chancellor in July, said she is \"ready\" to move into No11. Speaking at the Rolls-Royce factory in Derby, she said: \"To serve as chancellor of the exchequer would be the privilege of my life, not to luxuriate in status, not as a staging post in a career, but to serve. I know the responsibility that will come with that - I embrace it.\" She added: \"As I travel around the country, I see great potential wherever I go, in dynamic great British businesses like this one, in labs and classrooms in our world-leading universities, and in the talent and the effort of working people. \"It is time to unlock that potential, to turn the page on chaos and decline, and start a new chapter for Britain. Labour is ready.\" During her speech Ms Reeves also said that Rishi Sunak's decision to call an early General Election is proof \"he doesn't believe that his plan She added: \"Five prime ministers, seven chancellors, 12 plans for growth, each delivering less than the last. \"To put it in perspective, if our economy had grown at the average rate of OECD countries these last 14 years, our economy today would be £150 billion larger, worth £5,000 for every household and providing £55 billion more investment for our public services. \"That is their record and they deserve to be judged on it. The Conservatives have failed on the economy. The plan isn't working. And Rishi Sunak's decision to call a snap General Election is the clearest sign of that. If he doesn't believe that his plan is working, why should you? \"And no matter how much they tell us that Liz Truss was nothing to do with them, their every action speaks otherwise. They haven't learned their lessons. They're singing from the same songbook.\" Watch the Mirror's new show Party Games as MPs spill Westminster secrets",

        "content": "The odds will be ever in your favor once you know how to watch “The Hunger Games” movies in order on some of the best streaming services . The franchise comprises five movies, and they often move between streaming platforms. Based on the best-selling novels by Suzanne Collins, “The Hunger Games” is set in the dystopian world of Panem, where each year 24 tributes (a male and a female from each of the 12 Districts) are selected to compete in the eponymous games; a Battle Royale-style fight to the death, for the pleasure of the ruling Capitol. The hero of “The Hunger Games” franchise is Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), who is forced to volunteer for the 74th Hunger Games after her younger sister is selected. She enters the games alongside the baker’s son Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), and battles to survive under the watchful eye of the Capitol's ruler, President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Alongside following Katniss’ journey to survive the games and lead a rebellion against the cruel Capitol, there is also a prequel entry, “The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes”, that explores the backstory of President Snow, and explains how he becomes the ruthless dictator that torments Katniss. “The Hunger Games” movies are the rarest of blockbusters that earned significant box office revenue and strong critical praise. But with five movies to watch, it can be confusing to know where to start, so here are all the details you need to stream “The Hunger Games” in release date order or by chronological events. As of May 2024, you can watch the four mainline “The Hunger Games” movies on Netflix . However, if you want to binge these excellent movies, you’ll need to be quick as four flicks are confirmed to be leaving the world's most popular streaming service at the end of the month (May 31). Meanwhile, if you want to delve deeper into the world of Panem, “The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes” is currently streaming on Starz or PVOD platforms like Amazon , YouTube and Apple . Upgrade your life with a daily dose of the biggest tech news, lifestyle hacks and our curated analysis. Be the first to know about cutting-edge gadgets and the hottest deals. Watching “The Hunger Games” movies in order of release is super simple. The first four movies adapt the initial trilogy of books, and then the prequel adapts the latest novel in the series. Here are all “The Hunger Games” movies listed in order of their theatrical release: Piecing together “The Hunger Games” timeline is a lot simpler compared to some of its contemporaries, you just need to swap around a single movie, “The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snake”. Otherwise, you can watch as normal. The first four movies follow Katniss’ storyline in a strictly linear fashion, covering her participation in the 74th Hunger Games and beyond, then the prequel fills in some of the blanks and is set more than 50 years before the rest of the movie in the sci-fi action series. However, before diving into the chronological order, I should warn you that it’s only recommended to watch “The Hunger Games” movies in timeline order if you have already seen the movies at least once before, or are very familiar with the source material. As of writing, there are no details on any future “Hunger Games” movies. In a 2023 interview with Variety , franchise producer Nina Jacobson and director Francis Lawrence (who directed every “Hunger Games” movie bar the first), confirmed that there were no plans for any more “Hunger Games” movies unless author Suzanne Collins has fresh ideas that she feels are worth exploring. Essentially it seems we won’t get any more “Hunger Games” movies without first getting a new “Hunger Games” book. On that front, Collins has not confirmed that she is working on future novels set within Panem. However, there was a lengthy gap of 10 years between “Mockingjay” (published in 2010) and “The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes” (published in 2020), so fans are used to waiting years between installments. Should Collins confirm another novel, it seems highly likely that the franchise's creative team would reunite for another adaptation, but as things stand, don’t expect to be revisiting the world of “The Hunger Games” on the big screen any time soon. Guess we’ll just have to settle for binge-watching the five available “Hunger Games” movies for the umpteenth time!",

        "content": "Valeura Energy Inc. is a Canada-based public company engaged in the exploration, development, and production of petroleum and natural gas in Turkey. CALGARY, Alberta, May 28, 2024 (Korea Bizwire) – Valeura Energy Inc. (TSX:VLE, OTCQX:VLERF) (“ Valeura ” or the “ Company “), an upstream oil and gas company with assets in the Gulf of Thailand and the Thrace Basin of Türkiye, is pleased to announce the successful completion of an infill drilling campaign at Nong Yao A and the start of development drilling on the Nong Yao C extension, both part of the Nong Yao oil field (90% operated working interest), offshore Gulf of Thailand. Sean Guest, President and CEO commented: “I am pleased with the results of our new Nong Yao A wells, which further illustrate the potential of our assets to add volumes through ongoing infill drilling. Drilling these wells now was a nimble move by our team to shore up production rates just before dedicating our rig to the Nong Yao C development drilling programme. The start of drilling operations at our brand new Nong Yao C infrastructure marks a significant milestone for our Company. This will be the first new development for Valeura in Thailand, and is expected to serve as a substantial source of production growth in the second half of this year. We remain focused on safe and sustainable growth, and I am pleased to note that our drilling operations have achieved an important safety record, logging one full year of work without a lost time injury. We remain committed to delivering a top tier health, safety, and environmental performance across all our operations.” Nong Yao A Infill Wells Valeura has drilled two production-oriented horizontal wells at the Nong Yao A wellhead platform, which were both successful and have been brought online as producers. The 37H well culminated in a horizontal section within the primary target H12.5 reservoir. That zone has been completed for production and is currently contributing approximately 500 bbls/d of oil ( 1) , based on performance over the past ten days. In addition, the well encountered 68 feet of net oil pay across eight separate appraisal target intervals. These zones will now be further evaluated as targets for potential future development wells, and once developed, may add further producible volumes to the asset. The 38H well has been completed as a horizontal producer in the H4.3 reservoir interval and is currently contributing approximately 1,000 bbls/d of oil ( 1) , based on performance over the past five days. A thin oil-bearing sand was encountered in the shallower H2.0 sand interval and will also be studied to determine additional producible volumes. Nong Yao C Development The Company’s contracted drilling rig has moved to the Nong Yao C mobile offshore production unit where it has commenced batch drilling operations to develop the Nong Yao C field extension. The drilling campaign is anticipated to take approximately four months and will be comprised of up to nine gross wells, being six producer wells and up to three water injectors. Valeura anticipates first oil from the Nong Yao C development in Q3 2024, and thereafter is targeting aggregate peak oil production rates from the expanded Nong Yao field of 11,000 bbls/d, approximately a 50% increase over the 7,307 bbls/d reported for Q1 2024 (1) .

        "content": "Natural Gas price (XNG/USD) is testing this week’s low on Tuesday after prices fell on Monday due to extensive profit-taking. The decline on Tuesday comes on the back of headlines that the opposition in Israel is planning to meet on Wednesday to look for ways to oust Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Tensions build up in Israel after several world nations expressed their concerns after the attack on a refugee camp in Rafah, which killed at least 45 people. Meanwhile, (DXY) eases further on Tuesday ahead of the official start of the week for US markets after a bank holiday on Monday for Memorial Day. The retreat comes after warnings from Japanese Finance Minister Shun’ichi Suzuki, who pushed against any attempts to further devalue the Japanese Yen by saying that every measure is at their disposal in order to assure a stable exchange rate. The US economic agenda is set to kick off with a slew of data and four US (Fed) speakers. Natural Gas is trading at $2.77 per MMBtu at the time of writing. Natural Gas is sliding lower with rumors of possibly an opposition coalition formation that could take over power from current ruling Prime Minister Benjamin Nethanyahu, an event that could de-escalate the situation in the region. After the Rafah massacre over the weekend, international disapproval is growing and even the US is seeing how its arguments to stand by Israel are starting to run out. If a new coalition took control of the government, the current offensive in Gaza could be ended and recalled, easing tensions in the region. The $3.00 marker as a big figure was easily broken on Wednesday. The pivotal level near $3.07 (high of March 6, 2023) remains key as prices failed to post a daily close above it. Further up, the fresh year-to-date high at $3.16 is the level to beat. On the downside, the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is acting as first support near $2.53. Should that support area fail to hold, then the pivotal level near $2.14 should do the trick ahead of $2.11, where both the 55-day and 100-day SMA are trading. Natural Gas FAQs Supply and demand dynamics are a key factor influencing Natural Gas prices, and are themselves influenced by global economic growth, industrial activity, population growth, production levels, and inventories. The weather impacts Natural Gas prices because more Gas is used during cold winters and hot summers for heating and cooling. Competition from other energy sources impacts prices as consumers may switch to cheaper sources. Geopolitical events are factors as exemplified by the war in Ukraine. Government policies relating to extraction, transportation, and environmental issues also impact prices. The main economic release influencing Natural Gas prices is the weekly inventory bulletin from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), a US government agency that produces US gas market data. The EIA Gas bulletin usually comes out on Thursday at 14:30 GMT, a day after the EIA publishes its weekly Oil bulletin. Economic data from large consumers of Natural Gas can impact supply and demand, the largest of which include China, Germany and Japan. Natural Gas is primarily priced and traded in US Dollars, thus economic releases impacting the US Dollar are also factors. The US Dollar is the world’s reserve currency and most commodities, including Natural Gas are priced and traded on international markets in US Dollars. As such, the value of the US Dollar is a factor in the price of Natural Gas, because if the Dollar strengthens it means less Dollars are required to buy the same volume of Gas (the price falls), and vice versa if USD strengthens.",

        "description": "In the initial phases of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, low voter turnout raised concerns for both the Election Commission and political parties. Delayed data updates sparked opposition backlash, with experts divided on whether it disadvantages the BJP or Congress. Voter engagement shifts in key constituencies like Amethi highlight evolving political dynamics. As the nation eagerly awaits the June 4 results, many candidates' fates hang in the balance.",
        "content": "NEW DELHI: In the initial phases of Lok Sabha elections 2024, low voter turnout percentage emerged as a concern not just for the Election Commission but also for the political parties including Bharatiya Janata Party and INDI alliance. However, the seats being contested in the 2024 elections are not exactly the same as those in the 2019 elections, but the differences led to a debate over the implications of low voter turnout. In a move questioned by several opposition parties, the Election Commission updated the voter turnout percentage for phase 1 of the Lok Sabha election after 11 days and for phase 2 after 2 days. With phase 1 polls completed on April 19 voter turnout data for phase 1 was released by a delay of 11 days on April 30, followed by phase 2 data on April 28, just two days after the phase 2 elections on April 26. Opposition parties questioned the delayed update of turnout data. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge wrote a letter to all parties, urging them to raise their voices against the Election Commission's move. In his ‘open letter’ to INDIA bloc leaders and other opposition leaders, Kharge highlighted the delay in releasing the final voting percentages for the initial phases of the Lok Sabha elections, suggesting that such delays cast doubts on the credibility of the data provided by the poll panel. He questioned the rationale behind the Election Commission's delay in releasing the voter turnout data, which was made public 11 days after the first phase and four days after the second phase. Additionally, he sought clarification from the Commission regarding the reasons for the delay. The Election Commission reacted sharply to Kharge's allegations and accused him of creating impediments in the conduct of free and fair elections. The Commission said it finds a ‘pattern’ in a series of past and present irresponsible statements from Congress. Calling it ‘disconcerting’, the commission added that with all facts in place, the Congress President is attempting to push a biased narrative. Following this, turnout data for subsequent phases was uploaded much faster. Experts interpret the difference in voter turnout in various ways. Some suggest that low voter turnout could disadvantage the Bharatiya Janata Party, while others believe it might harm the Congress more. The BJP, along with other opposition parties and the Congress, both claimed that the low voter turnout would be harmful. The BJP asserted that its voters were turning out at the booths. In fact, top BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, passionately urged voters to cast their votes. Some experts suggested that the BJP was heading for a huge win, causing its voters to become complacent. BJP leaders, including PM Modi , made several appeals requesting voters to come out and vote. They claimed that it was the opposition voters who were not showing up because they were sure of their defeat. The change in voter turnout percentage cannot be a definitive metric to judge election outcomes, but it often provides valuable insights. The shifts in voting percentages in key constituencies are always of significant interest. For instance, the Election Commission data shows substantial increases in voter turnout in several important constituencies: Jodhpur saw a 19.04% increase, Gandhinagar experienced a 19.38% rise, and Khunti reported a 17.9% increase. These changes suggest varying levels of voter engagement and potential shifts in political dynamics across these regions. While some experts argue that a huge increase in voter turnout is a symbol for change, however that is not always the case. Smriti Irani , who contested from Amethi against Rahul Gandhi in the 2014 elections, lost despite a significant campaign. The voting turnout percentage did not show much change despite the difference in the result. In 2014, the voter turnout percentage in Amethi was 52.38%, which was in favor of Rahul Gandhi. In 2019, it saw a marginal increase to 54.05%, which resulted in a victory for Smriti Irani. Now, in 2024, Amethi reported a voter turnout of 54.34%. These slight changes in voter turnout percentages reflect the evolving political dynamics in the constituency. Despite these small changes in voter turnout, the constituency has seen varying electoral outcomes, highlighting that turnout percentages alone do not always predict the election results. When examining the data, the difference in voter turnout between 2019 and 2024 is notably marginal. The average voter turnout in 2019 was 66.54%, compared to 65.54% in 2024 – both figures only till phase 6. Many electoral experts have attributed this slight decline to various factors. A significant reason cited is the intense heat wave experienced during the 2024 elections. Additionally, the 2024 Lok Sabha elections were scheduled 15 days earlier than the 2019 elections, which may have also contributed to the lower turnout. These factors together have influenced voter participation, reflecting a complex interplay of environmental and logistical elements. The nation eagerly awaits June 4, when the long-anticipated electoral results will be revealed, determining the fate of many candidates.",

        "content": "Israel’s foreign minister accused Spain of “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes” on Tuesday. Spain, Norway and Ireland moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations designed to add international pressure on Israel to soften its devastating response to last year’s Hamas-led attack. The diplomatic move has no immediate impact on the war in Gaza, but adds to international pressure on Israel to soften its devastating response to October’s Hamas-led attack. Israeli strikes on Rafah overnight killed at least 16 Palestinians, first responders said Tuesday, as residents reported an escalation of fighting in the southern Gaza city. Over the weekend, an Israeli airstrike hit a tent camp in a western part of Rafah, causing a large fire and killing at least 45 people, according to health officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged a “tragic mishap” had occurred. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas, with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. In the past two weeks, more than a million Palestinians fled Rafah as Israeli forces pressed deeper into the city. People displaced by fighting lack shelter, food, water and other essentials for survival, the U.N. says. Israel says it needs to invade Rafah to destroy Hamas militants’ last stronghold. Israeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducted about 250. Israel says around 100 hostages are still captive in Gaza, along with the bodies of around 30 more. Currently: — Israeli strikes kill 16 in Rafah, medics say, as residents report heavy fighting. — Netanyahu says deadly Israeli strike in Rafah over the weekend was the result of a “tragic mishap.” — As Israel attacks Rafah, Palestinians are living in tents and scrounging for food. — Spain’s prime minister says its Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state as the EU rift with Israel widens. — An Israeli strike in southern Lebanon kills 2 people near a hospital, officials say.

Here’s the latest: DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes on Rafah have killed at least 16 Palestinians overnight, first responders said Tuesday, as residents reported an escalation of fighting in the southern Gaza city. An Israeli incursion launched earlier this month has caused nearly 1 million to flee from Rafah, most of whom have already been displaced in the war between Israel and Hamas, and who are now seeking refuge in squalid tent camps and war-ravaged areas. The latest strikes occurred in the same area where Israel targeted what it said was a Hamas compound on Sunday night. That strike ignited a fire in a camp for displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local health officials, sparking worldwide outrage. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there was a “tragic mishap” on Sunday and the military said it was investigating. The latest strikes killed a total of 16 people in the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood in northwest Rafah, according to the Palestinian Civil Defense and the Palestinian Red Crescent. COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Norway on Tuesday formally recognized a Palestinian state with the Scandinavian foreign minister calling it “a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.” Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said “the recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries.” However, “it is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively,” Barth Eide said. “The international community must increase its political and economic support for Palestine and continue the work for a two-state solution.” Last week, Norway, along with Spain and Ireland, said in a coordinated effort that they were recognizing a Palestinian state. MADRID — Spain moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland and Norway to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure to soften its devastating response to October’s Hamas-led attack. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz accused Spain of “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes” and told the country that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza. Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid insisting that sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s parliament reelected hard-liner Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf on Tuesday as its speaker, reaffirming its hard-right makeup in the wake of a helicopter crash that killed the country’s president and foreign minister. Of 287 lawmakers voting Tuesday, 198 backed Qalibaf to retain the position he first took in 2021. He initially became speaker following a string of failed presidential bids and 12 years as the leader of Iran’s capital city. Many, however, know Qalibaf for his support as a Revolutionary Guard general for a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999. He also reportedly ordered live gunfire to be used against Iranian students in 2003 while serving as the country’s police chief.",

        "content": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes on Rafah have killed at least 16 Palestinians, first responders said Tuesday, as residents reported an escalation of fighting in the southern Gaza city. An Israeli incursion launched in early May has caused nearly 1 million to flee from Rafah, most of whom have already been displaced in the war between Israel and Hamas, and who are now seeking refuge in squalid tent camps and war-ravaged areas. The United States and other close allies of Israel have warned against a full-fledged offensive in the city, with the Biden administration saying it would cross a red line and refusing to provide offensive arms for such an undertaking. On Friday, the International Court of Justice called on Israel to halt its Rafah offensive, an order it has no power to enforce. Advertisement Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead, saying Israeli forces must go into Rafah in order to dismantle Hamas and return hostages taken in the Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war. The latest strikes occurred in the same area where Israel targeted what it said was a Hamas compound on Sunday night. That strike ignited a fire in a camp for displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local health officials, sparking worldwide outrage. Netanyahu said there was a “tragic mishap” on Sunday and the military said it was investigating. Strikes overnight killed a total of 16 people in the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood in northwest Rafah, according to the Palestinian Civil Defense and the Palestinian Red Crescent. Israel says it is carrying out limited operations in eastern Rafah along the Gaza-Egypt border. But residents reported heavy bombardment overnight in western parts of Rafah as well. “It was a night of horror,” said Abdel-Rahman Abu Ismail, a Palestinian from Gaza City who has been sheltering in Tel al-Sultan since December. He said he heard “constant sounds” of explosions overnight and into Tuesday morning, with fighter jets and drones flying over the area. Advertisement He said it reminded him of the Israeli invasion of of his neighborhood of Shijaiyah in Gaza City, where Israel launched a heavy bombing campaign before sending in ground forces in late 2023. “We saw this before,” he said. Sayed al-Masri, a Rafah resident, said many families have been forced to flee their homes and shelters, with most heading for the crowded Mawasi area, where giant tent camps have been set up on a barren coastline, or to Khan Younis, a southern city that suffered heavy damage during months of fighting. “The situation is worsening” in Rafah, al-Masri said. Gaza’s Health Ministry said two medical facilities in Tel al-Sultan have been taken out of service because of intense bombing nearby. Medical Aid for Palestinians, a charity operating throughout the territory, said the Tel al-Sultan medical center and the Indonesian Field Hospital were under lockdown, with medics, patients and displaced people trapped inside. Most of Gaza’s hospitals are no longer functioning. The Kuwait Hospital in Rafah shut down Monday after a strike near its entrance killed two health workers. The war began when Hamas and other militants burst into southern Israel in a surprise attack on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 civilians and abducting around 250. More than 100 were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Israel responded to the Oct. 7 attack with a massive air, land and sea offensive that has killed over 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. Around 80% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million has been displaced and United Nations officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine. Advertisement Magdy reported from Cairo.",

        "description": "If the Tories win at the next general election, 18-year-olds will be expected to take part in a \"mandatory\" national service scheme - and we want to know what YOU think",
        "content": "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has vowed to resurrect a form of the national service scheme if the Conservatives win the general election - and we want to hear YOUR thoughts. Under the Tories’ controversial new plan , it will be mandatory for 18-year-olds to take part in either military training or community volunteering. While the details of the scheme have not been finalised, the PM believes the move will reignite the \"national spirit\" that emerged during the pandemic. It comes as a desperate pitch to older voters as the Tory leader struggles to turn around his party's gloomy prospects ahead of the general election on July 4. Around 30,000 teenagers would be able to take up places in the military for 12-months, where they will \"learn and take part in logistics, cyber security, procurement or civil response operations\". This is not considered to be conscription, as the teens will be able to pick the 'volunteer' option, which will be equivalent to one weekend per month - 25 days per year - in their community. According to the briefing, this could include organisations such as the fire service, police, the NHS , and charities working with older people to tackle loneliness. They could also help out at the British Red Cross, the RNLI search and rescue charity, and at St John's Ambulance. Most teenagers will end up in the volunteering side of the scheme - which they will not be paid for - while those who do the military element will be. Speaking at a campaign event in Buckinghamshire, Mr Sunak said: \"This modern form of national service will mean that young people get the skills and the opportunities that they need, which is going to serve them very well in life. \"It is going to foster a culture of service which is going to be incredibly powerful for making our society more cohesive, and in a more uncertain and dangerous world it's going to strengthen our country's security and resilience.\" In a separate TikTok video, he added: \"As is the case in other countries, we will provide a stipend to help with living costs for those doing the military element alongside their training. Meanwhile, on the civic side, we will make sure organisations have funding for training and administration.\" If the Tories win the upcoming election, the government would establish a Royal Commission to design the programme. The party said the first national service pilots would be open for application in September 2025 - before a National Service Act is introduced. The proposed legislation would make it mandatory that every 18-year-old will be \"required to do national service by the end of the next Parliament\" - in five years' time. Home Secretary James Cleverly told Sky News that 18-year-olds would not be jailed for refusing national service. He said: \"No, there's going to be no criminal sanction. There's no one going to jail over this.\" Meanwhile, Deputy Chairman James Daly told the BBC there would \"be some form of sanction\" for those not taking part in the mandatory scheme. Responding to the announcement, a Labour spokesman said: \"This is another desperate £2.5 billion unfunded commitment from a Tory Party which already crashed the economy, sending mortgages rocketing, and now they’re spoiling for more. This is not a plan – it’s a review which could cost billions and is only needed because the Tories hollowed out the Armed Forces to their smallest size since Napoleon.\" Labour leader Keir Starmer said: \"The desperation of this National Service policy - a teenage Dad’s Army - paid for by cancelling levelling-up funding and money from tax avoidance that we would use to invest in our NHS . All elections are a choice and this is a clear one: levelling up and the NHS with Labour. Or more desperate chaos with the Tories. That is the choice.\" Following the latest update, we want to know if YOU support the national service. Vote in our poll HERE to have your say.

Be to, rašte politikams asociacijos kaltina VLK bandymu daryti spaudimą visuomeninėms organizacijoms dėl viešai išsakytos pozicijos, rašoma pranešime spaudai.",
        "content": "Kreipimesi pažymima, kad siekiamos įtraukti naujos Sveikatos draudimo įstatymo pataisos nebuvo derintos su visuomene, sveikatos sistemos dalyviais bei kitais socialiniais partneriais, neatliktas jų poveikio vertinimas. Tuo tarpu organizacijos gegužės 15 dieną kreipėsi į Seimo Sveikatos reikalų komiteto narius su prašymu įsiklausyti į argumentus bei nepalaikyti nesuderintų pasiūlymų, tačiau, nepaisant to, komitete jie buvo priimti. Raštą Seimo nariams pasirašė Šeimos gydytojų profesinė sąjunga, Lietuvos medikų sąjūdis, Lietuvos pacientų organizacijų atstovų taryba, Diagnostikos ir gydymo įstaigų asociacija, Lietuvos vaistinių asociacija, Lietuvos privačių sveikatos priežiūros įstaigų asociacija, Lietuvos gydytojų vadovų sąjunga. Naujais siūlymais, kuriuos Seimui teikia Sveikatos reikalų komiteto nariai, siekiama, kad VLK turėtų vienašališką galią spręsti dėl sutarčių su gydymo įstaigomis bei vaistinėmis sudarymo, vykdymo, stabdymo arba nutraukimo. Be to, kreipimesi nuogąstaujama, kad net ir apskundus VLK sprendimą teismui, bylos nagrinėjimo metu, sveikatos įstaiga privalėtų nutraukti kompensuojamų paslaugų teikimą gyventojams. Anot kreipimosi iniciatorių, VLK įstatymais yra suteiktos išskirtinės gydymo įstaigų kontrolės bei priežiūros teisės, tačiau ne visada jos naudojamos tinkamais tinklais. Kaip teigiama rašte, medikų, pacientų bei vaistinių atstovams gegužę raštu išsiuntus kreipimąsi į Seimo Sveikatos reikalų komitetą su prašymu nepalaikyti siekiamų įtraukti naujų pataisų, buvo sulaukta VLK spaudimo dėl išsakytos pozicijos. „Lietuvos pacientų organizacijų atstovų tarybai (LPOAT) kartu su kitais Socialiniais partneriais raštu pateikus argumentuotas pastabas dėl Sveikatos reikalų komitete svarstomų pataisų, VLK sukvietė LPOAT ir kitas tam tikromis ligomis sergančių pacientų organizacijas, priekaištavo joms dėl minėto rašto, taip darydama neleistiną įtaką ir spaudimą nevyriausybinių organizacijų veiklai, jų teisei išreikšti nepriklausomai nuomonę, kas nėra suderinama su gerąja viešojo administravimo praktika“, – teigiama kreipimesi Seimo nariams. Rašte nuogąstaujama, kad suteikus VLK dar didesnę galią spręsti dėl sutarčių su gydymo įstaigomis sudarymo, stabdymo ar nutraukimo, gali būti sukurta neproporcinga ir pavojinga padėtis. „Tai gali akivaizdžiai sudaryti prielaidas VLK piktnaudžiauti suteiktomis perteklinėmis galiomis, rastųsi prielaidos šališkumui bei korupcijai“, – akcentuojama politikams. Kreipimusi taip pat siekiama atkreipti dėmesį, kad dauguma VLK šiuo metu nustatomų pažeidimų, dėl kurių būtų stabdomos arba nutraukiamos sutartys su gydymo įstaigomis, nėra tyčinės ar piktybinės veiklos rezultatas, o kyla dėl sistemų klaidų, dažnos teisės aktų kaitos bei jų nesuderinamumo, didelio personalo darbo krūvio. „Apie tai, deja, nutylima, visą kaltę ir atsakomybę suverčiant slaugytojams, gydytojams, vaistininkams, vadovams, kurie yra verčiami prisiimti kaltę ir atsakomybę, gąsdinami ir baudžiami, tampa netobulos sveikatos sistemos įkaitais“, – akcentuojama rašte. Be to, organizacijų ir asociacijų atstovų teigimu, pasigendama didesnio bendradarbiavimo tarp institucijų. Anot jų, gydymo įstaigoms nėra teikiama visa informacija apie nustatytų pažeidimų priežastis, nerengiamos sisteminės analizės, taip pat nesuteikiama galimybė dalyvauti medicinos įstaigų veiklos kontrolės rezultatų aptarimuose, įsitraukti rengiant teisės aktus. „Nesant atviro, pasitikėjimu ir partneryste grįsto bendradarbiavimo kultūros bei praktikos, VLK santykiai su gydymo įstaigomis dažnai grindžiami baime ir nepasitikėjimu, kas siūlomą VLK galių didinimo įteisinimą daro itin radikaliu ir atgrasančiu, keliančiu pagrįstų abejonių, ar tai tinkamiausias būdas tikslams pasiekti“, – rašoma kreipimesi. Rašte politikams teigiama, kad priėmus naujus siūlymus ir suteikus VLK vienašališką galią priimti sprendimus dėl sutarčių su gydymo įstaigomis bei vaistinėmis, neabejotinai pablogėtų valstybės kompensuojamų medicinos paslaugų ir vaistų prieinamumas pacientams. Anot kreipimosi iniciatorių, gyventojai būtų priversti arba kreiptis į kitas gydymo įstaigas, taip dar labiau didinant ilgų eilių pas gydytojus problemą, arba mokėti visą medicinos, slaugos ar odontologijos paslaugų kainą. „Tai ypač paveiktų pacientus, gyvenančius šalies nutolusiuose regionuose, rajonuose, kaimiškose vietovėse – visur, kur nėra didelių alternatyvaus pasirinkimo galimybių“, – rašoma rašte Seimo nariams. Be to, organizacijų bei asociacijų atstovų teigimu, naujuose siūlymuose siekiama įvirtinti, kad kylančius konfliktus tarp VLK bei gydymo įstaigų, vaistinių būtų galima spręsti tik administracine tvarka. Anot jų, tai apsunkins galimybes gydymo įstaigoms apskųsti VLK sprendimą, mat teisminiai procesai taps brangūs ir ilgi. „Tam tikri kylantys ginčai yra išimtinai civilinio pobūdžio ir administracinės teisenos institucijos pagal kompetenciją tokių ginčų nespręstų – nukreiptų į bendrosios kompetencijos teismus. Tai lemtų itin ilgą, brangų, neefektyvų ir neracionalų procesą, kurio laikotarpiu sutartys su gydymo įstaigomis liktų sustabdytos, negalėtų užtikrinti valstybės kompensuojamos sveikatos priežiūros pacientams, mokėti atlyginimų darbuotojams, dėl ko galimai būtų priverstos stabdyti ar net nutraukti savo veiklą“, – teigiama kreipimesi.

On Monday, there were parades across the region, including one in Eastwood . (Dennis Nett photo) The Last Boy Scouts: Inside the quest to save Syracuse’s sole remaining Scout troop: Troop 1, founded in 1914, is the oldest Boy Scouts troop in Syracuse -- and also the last. Terry Richmond, 80, is still teaching youths how to tie square knots in hopes of recruiting new scouts and saving a 110-year-old tradition . “If you guys join, we’re back in business,” said Richmond, promising to teach them how to start a fire, use an axe, pitch a tent and learn how to cook. “The next thing is how soon would you guys like to go camping?” Woman fatally shot, left outside Syracuse hospital, was ‘devoted mother:’ Kimberlin Gatewood “had a personality and a smile that would warm you up ,” her sister said. Gatewood’s boyfriend, Maurice J. Giles, turned himself in to police two days after the shooting. He’s charged with manslaughter and criminal possession of a weapon. It’s alleged the shooting was accidental. Gatewood leaves behind an 8-year-old son. How one CNY worker store stopped a workplace shooting: John Guralny had a gun to his face. Holding the pistol, James Corp — who was fired from the White’s Lumber store in Pulaski — asked him if he wanted to die. Guralny swatted the gun away and wrestled him to the ground, according to Pulaski police. Guralny, 42, recently talked to syracuse.com about what happened. Things to do this week: One of country music biggest superstars, Kenny Chesney, takes the stage on Thursday night at the Amphitheater. A hit Broadway musical about the six wives of King Henry VIII will be at the Landmark Theatre, the Minoa Field Days, and Chittenango’s celebration of the “Wizard of Oz” are all set to go this week . Lia Garnes | Contributing photographer The drought is over: The West Genesee baseball team won its first Section III title with a 2-1 win over Whiteboro . The game was tied 1-1 until the Wildcats scored in the bottom of the sixth inning. Also winning sectional titles over the weekend were the Christian Brothers Academy baseball team and the Liverpool softball team . (Lia Garnes photo) Day after WNBA debut, Dyaisha Fair released: On Saturday, the former Syracuse basketball star had two assists in four minutes in her first game with the Las Vegas Aces. The next day, she was released . Fair, a second-round draft pick last month, made the roster, which isn’t easy to do. But the Aces, apparently lacking reliable depth, decided to waive Fair. A sense of gratitude as Syracuse lacrosse players move on: The Orange women lost to Boston College in the NCAA seminfinals on Friday (and the Eagles went on to win the national title on Sunday). Sixteen of SU’s 42 rostered players are either seniors or grad students who chose to come back for a fifth year. Now their younger teammates are left with the question: How many more years — and meetings with Boston College — will it take before they win their first-ever national championship ?

        "content": "HELEN Flanagan has sent temperatures soaring with a busty new video on Instagram. The Coronation Street icon is getting ready for a summer of love after signing up to Celebs Go Dating, and ahead of his stripped down to a black bikini in order to show off her figure. In a selfie video, Helen as seen posing as she moved her camera around and played with her hair after getting a blowdry. With her long blonde locks hanging loose over her shoulders, Helen bopped her head to track Love Me Jeje by Tems, as she revealed she had secretly ducked away for a quick holiday. She also pulled out her sunglasses and put them on her head to complete the look. Joining dozens of other celeb faces who have been to this party island over the past two months, Helen wrote: \"Quick little Ibiza trip before the kids came back this weekend.\" Helen is getting ready to dive back into the dating pool after splitting from her partner of 13 years , Scott Sinclair, in 2022. The couple share three children – Matilda, eight, Delilah, five, and Charlie, two – and co-parent them following the split. After admitting she was ready to fall in love again, Helen is recruiting the team behind Celebs Go Dating to see if they can find The One for her. Dating hasn’t been easy for Helen, who earlier this month revealed her struggles in the wake of her traumatic breakdown with Scott. In the space of two years, she has spoken about being ghosted, bored by ‘dead chat’ on dates, and having a one night stand . Helen confessed she had a secret relationship with an older man for six months - but she called it off as she felt it was too soon after coming out of her long engagement with ex Scott. But now she's ready to put herself out there, and she won't be alone in her mission with other celeb faces along for the ride. She'll be joined on the series by Love Island All Star Chris Taylor, Gogglebox's newly single Stephen Lustig-Webb, and pop star turned Hollyoaks star Jamelia. Made in Chelsea's Tristan Phipps and MAFS star Ella Morgan complete the line-up.",

        "content": "Belgrade-based attorney Igor Isailovic, who collaborated with Serbian Finance Minister Sinisa Mali but also with other businessmen linked to the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), has been awarded a contract worth over 14 million dinars (1 euro – 117 dinars) for legal services to be provided in the implementation of the specialized EXPO 2027 project. According to the information posted on the Public Procurement portal, the provision of legal services was estimated at 12 million dinars (ex VAT), and Isailovic got the job because he had the lowest bid, amounting to 60 thousand dinars less than the estimated value. When VAT is added, Isailovic will sign a contract worth 14.328 million dinars for providing legal services to the state, that is, to the company EXPO 2027 d.o.o. Belgrade. The tender was announced on the Public Procurement portal on May 8, the first work day after the Easter holidays, and the decision to award the contract to Isailovic was published on Tuesday, May 28. Two other attorneys took part in the race for the contract worth over 122 thousand euros, but both submitted bids above the estimated value.",

        "content": "A merchant vessel off the Yemeni coast took on water and tilted to one side after being targeted with three missiles, British security firm Ambrey said on Tuesday. The vessel issued a distress call stating it had sustained damage to the cargo hold and was taking on water approximately 54 nautical miles southwest of Yemen's Hodeidah, Ambrey added. \"According to the distress call, the vessel was listing,\" it said. Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi militias have launched repeated drone and missile strikes in the Red Sea region since November, later expanding to the Indian Ocean in what they say is solidarity with Palestinians. The European Union on Tuesday said it had extended its sanctions against the Syrian government and its supporters until June 2025. EU countries said they remained \"deeply concerned\" about the situation in Syria, where 316 persons and 86 entities are now subjected to European sanctions including an asset freeze and travel ban. \"After more than 13 years, the conflict remains a source of suffering and instability for the Syrian people and the region,\" the EU Council said in a statement. Head of Sudan's Coordination of Civil and Democratic Forces (Taqaddum), former Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok called for an urgent “roundtable conference” to agree on implementing the principles of the Nairobi Declaration, which he signed with armed movements. He also urged the warring parties to immediately end the fighting, and the international community to exert more pressure in order to open humanitarian corridors. Speaking at the opening of Taqaddum’s inaugural conference in Addis Ababa on Monday, Hamdok stressed that his party is seeking to ease the suffering of “the hungry, the poor, refugees and the displaced” and to implement “the democratic program, with the aim of establishing a homeland for all”. He praised the Nairobi Declaration and called for holding roundtable talks to discuss the Sudanese crisis in all its aspects. Held under the slogan “Our Unity Makes Peace”, the Taqaddum conference kicked off in the Ethiopian capital on Monday after being postponed for a day as Sudanese authorities tried to prevent some members from reaching the location and arrested others. On May 18, Hamdok separately signed what was known as the Nairobi Declaration with head of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement Abdelaziz Al-Hilu and head of the Sudan Liberation Army Movement Abdel Wahid Mohamed Nur. The declaration called for an end to the war and the establishment of a secular federal state, separating religion from the state, and providing the right to self-determination to the peoples of Sudan, in the event that the terms of the declaration were not agreed upon at the planned roundtable. Hamdok called on both sides of the fighting “to open safe corridors for the delivery of humanitarian aid, and to confront the looming famine that is threatening millions of our people.” This famine, if it is not addressed, will lead to the loss of many more lives than those killed in the conflict, he warned. Hamdok urged the international and regional communities to assume their responsibilities, and to exert pressure on the two warring parties – the army and Rapis Support Forces - to allow the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid, and to prevent the use of food and medicine as a weapon to kill more civilians. Palestinian Premier and Foreign Minister Mohammad Mustafa revealed that five European countries will soon recognize the Palestinian state. In exclusive statements to Asharq Al-Awsat, he said: “Other important and internationally prominent non-European countries will follow... They will also soon recognize the Palestinian state, and some of them may take several months...” In a telephone interview with Asharq Al-Awsat from Riyadh, the prime minister underlined the importance of Saudi Arabia’s role, stressing that coordination with “the brothers in Saudi Arabia is at the highest level.” “Saudi Arabia has linked any regional peace to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state,” Mustafa stated, adding that the Kingdom plays a diplomatic role in pushing for the release of Palestinian funds that are withheld by Israel, and in supporting the government’s plans for the post-war stage. Commenting on the Brussels meeting, during which the Palestinian Prime Minister presented the reform plan with the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Quartet office on Palestine, Mustafa noted that all partners have “praised the government’s reform program [...] and the wise policy of President Mahmoud Abbas.” Meanwhile, a European official told Asharq Al-Awsat that the European Union appreciates Saudi Arabia’s efforts with regard to reviving the peace process. Luis Miguel Bueno, the official spokesman for the European Union for the Middle East and North Africa, referred to the meeting in Brussels, on Monday, with the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Qatar and the Emirates. Bueno highly valued the Kingdom’s efforts towards ending the war and establishing a “Palestinian state that lives side by side with the State of Israel.” The European official also pointed to intensified diplomatic movements in Brussels, which he said “express a shared vision by the European Union and our Arab partners to move forward towards a two-state solution.” British foreign minister David Cameron said on Tuesday an investigation by the Israeli army into the Rafah air strikes must be \"swift, comprehensive and transparent\", again calling for a pause in fighting. “Deeply distressing scenes following the air strikes in Rafah this weekend,” Cameron said on X, saying the “investigation must be swift, comprehensive and transparent.” “We urgently need a deal to get hostages out and aid in, with a pause in fighting to allow work towards a long-term sustainable ceasefire.” Israeli tanks reached the center of Rafah for the first time on Tuesday, witnesses said, three weeks into a ground operation in the southern Gaza city that has sparked global condemnation. The tanks were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a central Rafah landmark, the witnesses told Reuters. The Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in the Rafah area without commenting on reported advancements into the city center. Overnight, its forces pounded the city with airstrikes and tank fire, residents said, pressing its offensive despite an international outcry over an attack on Sunday that sparked a blaze in a tent camp, killing at least 45 Palestinians, more than half of them children, women and the elderly. Since that strike, at least 26 more people have been killed by Israeli fire in Rafah, officials in the enclave run by Hamas militants said. Israeli tanks pushed towards western neighborhoods and took positions on the Zurub hilltop in western Rafah in one of the worst nights of bombardment reported by residents. On Tuesday, witnesses reported gunbattles between Israeli troops and Hamas-led fighters in the Zurub area. Witnesses in Rafah said the Israeli military appeared to have brought in remote-operated armored vehicles and there was no immediate sign of personnel in or around them. An Israeli military spokesperson had no immediate response. Since Israel launched its incursion by taking control of the border crossing with Egypt three weeks ago, tanks had probed around the edges of Rafah and entered some of its eastern districts but had not yet entered the city in full force. Reacting to Sunday night's attack in a camp where families displaced from assaults elsewhere in Gaza had sought shelter, global leaders urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault. Residents said the Tel Al-Sultan area, the scene of Sunday's deadly strike, was still being heavily bombarded. \"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,\" one resident told Reuters over a chat app. Around one million people have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday. Israel has kept up attacks despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing that the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there. Spain, Ireland and Norway will officially recognize a Palestinian state on Tuesday, despite an angry reaction from Israel, which has found itself increasingly isolated after more than seven months of conflict in Gaza. The three nations have painted their decision as a way to speed efforts to secure a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas. More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area. Around one million people have fled the Gazan city of Rafah in the past three weeks, the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) said on Tuesday. The small city on the southern edge of the Gaza Strip had been sheltering more than a million Palestinians who fled Israeli assaults on other parts of the enclave. Since early May, Israel's military has been carrying out what it says is a limited operation in Rafah to kill fighters and dismantle infrastructure used by Hamas, which runs Gaza. It has told civilians to go to an \"expanded humanitarian zone\" some 20 km (12 miles) away. Many Palestinians have complained they are vulnerable to Israeli attacks wherever they go and have been moving up and down the Gaza Strip in the past few months. UNRWA said the flight from Rafah \"happened with nowhere safe to go and amidst bombardments, lack of food and water, piles of waste and unsuitable living conditions.\" Providing assistance and protection is becoming nearly \"impossible\", the agency said. Spain and Norway moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure on Tel Aviv to soften its devastating response to last year's Hamas-led attack. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the Spanish Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state at its Tuesday morning meeting. “This is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,” Sánchez, standing at the gates of the prime minister's palace in Madrid, said during a televised speech. Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz lashed out at Spain on X, saying Sánchez's government was “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes.” Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in a statement that “for more than 30 years, Norway has been one of the strongest advocates for a Palestinian state. Today, when Norway officially recognizes Palestine as a state, is a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.” While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so. Still, the adherence of three European countries to the group represents a victory for Palestinian efforts in the world of public opinion. Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid insisting that the EU should take measures against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. After Monday’s meeting of EU foreign ministers, Irish Foreign Minister Micheál Martin said “for the first time at an EU meeting, in a real way, I have seen a significant discussion on sanctions” for Israel. Norway, which is not an EU member but often aligns its foreign policy with the bloc, handed diplomatic papers to the Palestinian government over the weekend ahead of its formal recognition. At the same time, the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his weight behind the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including leaders of the Hamas militant group. The formal declaration and resulting diplomatic dispute come over seven months into a grinding war waged by Israel against Hamas in Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. Israel’s air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Last week's joint announcement by Spain, Ireland and Norway triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries’ ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and abductions. Some 140 countries — more than two-thirds of the United Nations — recognize a Palestinian state. The addition of three western European countries to that group will likely put pressure on EU heavyweights France and Germany to think hard about their continued refusal to follow suit. The United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu’s government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations. In his speech on Tuesday, Sánchez said that the recognition of a Palestinian state was “a decision that we do not adopt against anyone, least of all against Israel, a friendly people whom we respect, whom we appreciate and with whom we want to have the best possible relationship.” The Socialist leader, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a ceasefire in Gaza. He called for a permanent ceasefire, for stepping up humanitarian aid into Gaza and for the release of hostages that Hamas has held since the Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel’s response. Sánchez said that the move was to back the beleaguered Palestinian Authority, which lost effective political control of Gaza to Hamas. He laid out his vision for a state ruled by the Palestinian Authority that must connect the West Bank and Gaza via a corridor with east Jerusalem as its capital. Norway's Barth Eide added that “the recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries.” The Western-backed Palestinian Authority administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, cooperates with Israel on security matters and favors a negotiated two-state solution. Its forces were driven out of Gaza by Hamas when the movement seized power there in 2007. The Palestinians have long sought an independent state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. The idea of a land corridor linking Gaza and the West Bank through Israel was discussed in previous rounds of peace talks, but no serious or substantive peace negotiations have been held in over 15 years. “We will not recognize changes in the 1967 border lines other than those agreed to by the parties,” Sánchez added. “Furthermore, this decision reflects our absolute rejection of Hamas, a terrorist organization who is against the two-state solution,” Sánchez said. “From the outset, Spain has strongly condemned the terrorist attacks of Oct. 7. This clear condemnation is the resounding expression of our steadfast commitment in the fight against terrorism. I would like to underline that starting tomorrow we would focus all our efforts to implement the two-state solution and make it a reality.” Israel is also under pressure from the International Criminal Court after its chief prosecutor said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The ICJ is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied. The Israeli army said it kicked off a series of new security measures in the northern Israeli towns after carrying out a drill simulating a ground offensive in Lebanon. Lebanon’s Hezbollah group had intensified its attacks on Israel in response to the latter’s Monday strike that targeted a hospital entrance in south Lebanon killing one person. In recent weeks, the Israeli army carried out a drill simulating a ground offensive on Lebanon. The Israeli army spokesperson said the “exercise simulated combat scenarios in the northern arena, the rapid deployment of forces on the ground, the functioning of the division and brigade headquarters and the readiness of the forces for an attack”. Israel’s announcement comes amid new strict measures imposed in Israeli settlements and northern towns. News agencies have displayed images showing cement barriers placed as roadblocks in northern Israel. An Israeli newspaper also reported that the army decided to trim down its alert units in the northern towns, a decision that drew criticisms from Israeli officers. An order was also issued to close an Israeli settlement, and entry banned even for Israeli soldiers. The new measures triggered concern among the town residents, amid mass destruction of buildings estimated by Israel’s i24 News at 930 buildings destroyed by Hezbollah strikes. On Sunday, Hezbollah heavily shelled the town of Kiryat Shmona. The town’s municipal chief was quoted as saying that over 40 percent of the town’s fleeing residents have no plans of returning back. “We expect the number to rise”, he said. Hezbollah, in a wide-scale offensive, carried out 15 military operations on Sunday against Israeli targets in response to the latters’ successive attacks targeting people on motorcycles in Lebanese border towns. An Israeli strike on Monday outside a hospital in south Lebanon killed one person at the hospital entrance. He was heading for medical tests. Fifteen other people sustained varying injuries, including seven civilians and eight health care workers at Salah Ghandour Hospital in the city of Bint Jbeil. The hospital security guard, Hassan Jouni, underwent surgery due to severe injuries. For the first time since the hostilities began in the southern Lebanon border area, the Israeli army targeted the vicinity of a hospital on Monday morning. The Israeli military has increased its efforts in recent days to apprehend individuals using cars or motorcycles on the roads, resulting in the fatalities of Hezbollah members and civilians. The Lebanese Ministry of Health condemned the brutal Israeli shelling that targeted the hospital. Hezbollah retaliated against the Israeli assault on the hospital by “targeting and destroying the newly installed spy equipment at the Miskaf Am site.” The Israeli military said that it bombed a building where Hezbollah members were located in the Yaron border area on Sunday. Additionally, the air force targeted Hezbollah members in Hula, hitting a weapons storage facility in Mays Al-Jabal and military infrastructure in Khiam. The Israeli raid on the town of Yaron led to casualties. Two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants were attacked in Baghdad over the past 48 hours, causing damage but no injuries, and Iraqi security forces arrested some suspects, the interior ministry and police sources said on Monday. Initial investigations showed that the restaurants were targeted over the perceived support of US-based brands for Israel amid the war in the Gaza Strip, police sources said. The first attack took place early on Sunday when two men on a motorcycle threw a make-shift bomb at a branch of the American fried chicken chain restaurant in eastern Baghdad's Palestine Street, causing minor damage, police sources said. On Monday, another KFC Baghdad branch and a second American-style restaurant were attacked by group of masked men who broke into the restaurants and used sticks to smash glass and destroy furniture. They fled before the arrival of security forces, police sources said. KFC did not immediately comment on the attacks. The interior ministry did not elaborate on the motives behind the attacks and said a police commander and other officers responsible for the areas where the attacks occurred had been detained and faced punitive measures. Western brands have been hit by boycotts and other forms of protest by a largely spontaneous, grassroots campaign over Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip since the deadly Hamas attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7. The actions reflect a groundswell of anger over Israel's military operation that has killed more than 35,000 people in Gaza, according to health authorities there, and caused a humanitarian crisis. The Biden administration told Israel to take every precaution to protect civilians after a military strike in Rafah killed dozens of Palestinians, as it faced calls from some fellow Democrats to halt military shipments to Israel. \"Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,\" a National Security Council spokesperson said. \"But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians. Biden has faced increasing pressure from within his own party to scale back support for Israel, even before the airstrike on Sunday night that set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze in a Rafah camp, killing 45 people. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a prominent Democratic lawmaker in the House of Representatives, on Monday called the strike \"an indefensible atrocity\", adding in a social media post that \"it is long past time for the President to live up to his word and suspend military aid.\" \"Horrific and gut wrenching images coming out of Rafah last night,\" Representative Ayanna Pressley said in a social media post. \"How much longer will the US stand by while the Israeli military slaughters and mutilates Palestinian babies?\" Representative Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American serving in Congress, called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a \"genocidal maniac\". Netanyahu on Monday said the strike was not intended to cause civilian casualties but went \"tragically wrong.\" The NSC spokesperson said the US government was \"actively engaging\" with the Israeli military and others on the ground to assess what happened. Almost half of Democratic voters disapprove of Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war, according to a recent poll from Reuters/Ipsos. Weeks of campus protests about the war have added to the pressure, and wider demands for a permanent ceasefire have put Biden's reelection campaign on the defensive.",

        "content": "Gold (XAU/USD) is trading lower in the $2,340s on Tuesday, despite sentiment taking a negative turn (normally positive for Gold) on the back of concerns that demand in China – Gold’s largest market – might be fading. Gold weakens after imports to China fall Gold imports to China via Hong Kong fell 38% in April compared to the previous month, according to data from the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department, released on Monday. Net imports into the world's largest Gold consumer totaled 34.6 metric tons in April, compared to 55.8 tonnes in March, the data showed. Gold stored in Hong Kong International Airport accounts for the lion’s share of the Gold that is imported into mainland China. The commodity is mainly moved from one country to another principally by air so it gets stored at Hong Kong Airport before making the last leg of its journey across the border into China. The data marks a change from the high consumption recorded in the first quarter, which showed a 5.94% rise from a year earlier, according to data from the China Gold Association (CGA). 308.91 metric tons of the precious metal were consumed in the first three months of the year, the China Daily reported. Technical Analysis: Gold might be forming a Bear Flag is consolidating in a rectangular formation (red-shaded area) after its steep decline from the dizzy heights reached last week. The sell-off has taken XAU/USD below a major trendline, ushering in a new more bearish technical environment for the precious metal. The result is that Gold is probably in a short-term downtrend now, favoring short positions over longs. The precious metal has pulled back since bottoming on May 24 but it looks vulnerable to breaking down. The pullback might be a Bear Flag continuation price pattern. If so, it would suggest substantial downside – to at least $2,300 – in the event of a break below the $2,325 May 24 lows. Last week’s decisive break of the major trendline indicates a likely follow-through lower. The conservative target for the follow-through is $2,303 (the 0.618 extrapolation of the down move prior to the break – from $2,435 to $2,355). A more bearish move could see Gold fall all the way down to $2,272 (the 100% extrapolation of the move prior to the break). The latter level is also the support from the May 3 lower high. A break below the $2,325 lows would provide confirmation of more downside to these targets. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator crossed above its signal line on Monday, and the pullback continued developing in line with the signal from the indicator. However, it has weakened again on Tuesday and is currently pressuring the base of the rectangle. The precious metal’s medium and long-term trends are still bullish, suggesting the risk of a recovery remains high, yet price action is not supporting a resumption hypothesis. A decisive break back above the trendline, now at $2,375, would provide evidence of a recovery and reversal of the short-term downtrend. A decisive break would be one accompanied by a long green bullish candle or three green candles in a row. Gold FAQs Gold has played a key role in human’s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government. Central banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves. Gold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal. The price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.",

        "content": "I am honoured to have been mayor of Barnstaple for the last two years. Looking back through my calendar reminds me what an interesting and varied time it has been. I have attended around 120 events of many different types in and around Barnstaple as well as being a guest of other mayors across Devon. On average that’s over one event every week and when you add in my duties as chair of the town council, being a representative to various outside bodies and other work I do, I wonder how I found time to fit everything in or find a balance between work and home life! However, it really has been a privilege to represent Barnstaple, both in and around the town and at civic events elsewhere. I have formed many friendships and together with other mayors and consorts we are collectively known as the ‘chain gang’! There have been so many highlights during my time as mayor. Fair opening is always one, but in 2022 we were all deeply saddened by the loss of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, which meant that for a second time in recent years our historic fair opening was unable to take place. Last year we welcomed the ceremony back, with great gusto and enthusiasm, and with many guests from across the county. Among the other highlights of my years in office have been supporting the cultural life of the town and celebrating diverse cultures in our community. I have particularly fond memories of the Nigerians in Barnstaple Summer Party and I hope the people of Barnstaple continue to give them as warm a welcome as they gave me and my husband last year. It was also my pleasant task to renew our bonds of friendship with the people of our twin town of Susa in Italy, when I visited last autumn and spent time with them when they came to us in Barnstaple. Each year in my term of office, I have been proud to attend the Petroc graduation ceremony and to welcome the graduand award winners to our historic Guildhall. The future of Barnstaple looks to be in capable hands! I have also been pleased to meet many other bright and enthusiastic young people through my visits to schools and contacts with youth organisations. If I had to choose one particular highlight of my time as mayor, then it would have to be the raising of over £13,000 for some very worthy charities. It has been such a pleasure and privilege to support them, namely; The Veterans Charity, North Devon Hospice, Barnstaple in Bloom, North Devon Forum for Autistic Spectrum Conditions and ADHD Encompass Southwest. Thery are all very deserving organisations, each doing excellent work in endeavouring to improve people’s lives and help our community. We have raised money for the charities through various fundraising activities and events, culminating in my Mayor’s Ball in April this year. I must say that none of this would have been possible without the hard work of the excellent staff at Barnstaple Town Council, all of whom have contributed to my time as mayor. I would like to give a special mention by way of a thank-you to Jade Skelcher, our events officer and keeper of the mayoral diary; to Don Gramlich, Town Beadle and occasional mayoral chauffeur, and particularly to our town clerk Rob Ward, not only for his constant support and wise counsel but for the £400 he raised personally for my charities with his bicycle ride from Land’s End to John O’Groats. We have in our town clerk a man of ideas and of action! Going forward, I intend to continue to play my part in helping to shape the future of Barnstaple in my role as a town councillor. Among a number of exciting developments are The Woodyard - a community hub for our town, the creation of our Neighbourhood Plan and the continuation of the amazing Barnstaple Repair Café, which I will keep supporting personally. To conclude, well, thank you Barnstaple. Thank you for giving me the chance to be mayor of the town where I was born and raised. It is an honour very few get to experience and one I am most grateful for. I have met so many kind, generous and interesting people during my two-year term of office and I am sure you will continue to be as warm and welcoming to my successor, as you have to me.",

        "description": "Social media users were quick to point out that Mr Trump was railing against something that is standard procedure in a criminal trial",
        "content": "Donald Trump is being mocked after he launched into a fiery rant about a very simple, common process in a criminal trial. On the eve of closing arguments in his hush money trial in Manhattan, the former president took to Truth Social to complain that the prosecution is being a “big advantage” in the case. “WHY IS THE CORRUPT GOVERNMENT ALLOWED TO MAKE THE FINAL ARGUMENT IN THE CASE AGAINST ME? WHY CAN’T THE DEFENSE GO LAST? BIG ADVANTAGE, VERY UNFAIR. WITCH HUNT! DJT,” he wrote. What Mr Trump fails to understand is that this is the typical procedure for almost every criminal trial. Usually, the prosecution delivers its closing statement first, then the defense. Prosecutors are then able to deliver a rebuttal. In the rebuttal, the state will have one last attempt to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr Trump not only falsified business records, but did so with the intent to commit or cover up another crime. By contrast, defense attorneys do not have to prove anything or convince jurors of Mr Trump’s innocence; they only need to convince at least one juror that prosecutors have not proved his guilt beyond reasonable doube. Social media users were quick to point out that Mr Trump has overlooked this standard part of trial procedure in his Truth Social post on Monday night. “Donald Trump learning in real time how trial procedures work in virtually every criminal court,” Politico senior legal affairs reporter Kyle Cheney said in a post on X. “Prosecutors typically get a rebuttal during closings because burden of proof lies with them, not defense.” Even Mr Trump’s former attorney Jenna Ellis, who was also indicted alongside him in his criminal case in Georgia, chimed in, too. “I’m sure his lawyers advised him of the procedures and why, but he didn’t listen and doesn’t care,” she wrote. Dr Kristy Parker, a former federal civil rights prosecutor, also accused the former president of legal “ignorance.” “I wonder if there’s ever been a person who occupied the presidency who was this ignorant about basic principles of our criminal justice system,” she wrote. “Actually, I don’t wonder.” Meanwhile, University of Texas Law Professor Lee Kovarsky called the post “Kafkaesque,” to which Randall Eliason, a former US attorney who teaches law at George Washington University, responded: “It’s funny how many white collar defendants develop a sudden interest in criminal justice reform. “And btw - the answer is that because the state has the burden of proof, it gets the last word.” Closing arguments are set to begin on Tuesday in the trial, where Mr Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records over a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels in exchange for her silence about an alleged 2006 sexual encounter in the days leading up to the 2016 presidential election. Mr Trump’s then-attorney and “fixer” Michael Cohen made the $130,000 payment to Ms Daniels, then Mr Trump allegedly reimbursed him – but fraudulently labeled the payments as a “retainer” and “legal expense”. Prosecutors allege that the crimes are felonies as they were carried out in commission of another crime: to influence the 2016 election. In opening statements, Assistant District Attorney Matthew Colangelo said Mr Trump “orchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election” and then “covered up that criminal conspiracy by lying in his business records, over and over and over again.” As well as railing against the criminal justice system that all criminal defendants encounter, Mr Trump also sent out a series of other Truth Social posts about the case on Monday night, including attacking the judge presiding over his case. “Can you imagine, a President of the United States, who got more votes than any sitting President in the history of our Country, and who is also the Republican Nominee for President in the upcoming 2024 Election, and leading in all polls against the Democrat Nominee, Joe Biden, is tomorrow going before a Corrupt and Conflicted Democrat Appointed, Acting New York Judge, on a FAKE & MADE UP CASE by a Soros backed failed D.A., and the Judge himself, to see whether or not he will become a common criminal?,” he wrote. He continued: “According to virtually all Legal Scholars and Experts, THERE IS NO CRIME OR CASE against President Trump, and if there was it should have been brought seven years ago, not in the middle of his Campaign for President. Prosecutorial Misconduct. Election Interference!” There is no evidence of prosecutorial misconduct or election interference in the trial. The former president also bizarrely shared a Bible quote: “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. John 15:13.”",

        "content": "HOROSCOPES BY HOLIDAY , BY HOLIDAY MATHIS The lunar air sign trines urge us not to underestimate the power in small things. A tiny key can open a huge door. A poem that hardly takes up an inch of paper can conjure an entire new environment in the mind. A smile can save a sale or seal a friendship or launch a love affair, and an idea -- an idea can change the world. ARIES (March 21-April 19). It appears everyone is following along with an established structure, but these proceedings are more flexible than they seem. Whether you require other accommodations or you just want them, go ahead and ask. TAURUS (April 20-May 20). You are grateful for all your lessons, though not right away! That would be odd and probably false as the discomfort of growth typically is the kind of thing humans appreciate in retrospect, not in real time. GEMINI (May 21-June 21). You do not need to be daring in order to complete the work of the day, and yet all it takes is about 10% more courage to launch you out of the orbit of the ordinary and into a full-fledged adventure. CANCER (June 22-July 22). Your activities have gotten so entwined with the needs of your loved ones that you can’t even remember when you last had a whole day doing exactly what you wanted to do. You can remedy this with some planning ahead. LEO (July 23-Aug. 22). Is it really worth it to succeed in the eyes of others? Sure! But only if their idea of success just happens to match your own. The only prosperity that brings satisfaction happens on the journey of fulfilling your intentions for yourself. VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22). Since people want what you contribute, and there’s a limited supply of it, it only makes sense that you should raise your price. This probably doesn’t have to do with money. There’s a more subtle exchange here. LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 23). The sweet energy you’re radiating makes it easy for others to connect with you. The best part is you’re not even trying to have a positive aura; you get there by enjoying yourself. You’ll attract like-minded individuals and strengthen your relationships. SCORPIO (Oct. 24-Nov. 21). Some of the things that are now a part of your daily life are ongoing pursuits that will never stop being a lot of work for you. In that light, resisting or resenting them doesn’t make sense. Everything you accept helps to conserve your energy. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21). Your emotions may seem too intense or different from what the other people seem to be experiencing, but they are exactly right for you. It is not productive to try and manage them. Instead, regard them as strange gifts to cherish. CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19). People don’t always behave in the expected way, but there’s always something to gain from the experience -- if nothing else, then tolerance. The more you can accept, the more powerful you become. AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18). The beat demands motion, and the motion demands a beat. Marching to the beat of your own drum is not difficult for you. The only time it gets complicated is when there are other rhythms going on. This is why you’ll find your own field today. PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20). A burning need to confide is part of the astral alchemy for you now. It’s still difficult to know who is trustworthy. Even your own diary, if left unprotected, could reveal you. Be judicious. TODAY’S BIRTHDAY (May 28). This year teaches you that many limits are actually illusions that disappear when you believe harder and charge forward. More highlights: You’ll attract connections that align with your values and aspirations and cherish your existing relationships, savoring the beauty and love they bring to your life. You’ll be paid well for work that lets you be authentically yourself. Aries and Gemini adore you. Your lucky numbers are: 7, 1, 3, 33 and 19. CELEBRITY PROFILES : Colbie Caillat will celebrate the first blushes of her new solar year with performances at the Country Music Association Awards and various summer festivals. The Grammy-winning artist is a Gemini trendsetter who influences with healthy choices. She maintains a meatless diet even when she’s touring the world and living out of a suitcase. Caillat’s Virgo moon is a moon of discipline, nutrition, neatness, organization and health. Holiday Mathis’ debut novel, “How To Fail Epically in Hollywood,” is out now!

        "content": "Even though Burnley’s miserable Premier League 2023–2024 season resulted in their relegation to the EFL Championship, Kompany is the front-runner to take over as manager of Bayern Munich (via ). The former Belgian centre-back has been the manager of Burnley for two seasons now. He guided them to the Premier League by winning the Championship after getting 100-points but in his first season in the top flight, Burnley got relegated back to the Championship. As per ‘s report, Manchester City have added former captain Vincent Kompany to their shortlist of possible successors to Pep Guardiola at the Etihad Stadium. The future of Guardiola has been the subject of conversation these days after reported that the Spaniard will leave the Premier League club at the end of next season. Guardiola’s contract is set to expire after next season and there is a belief that he will leave the Etihad Stadium after next season. The Daily Mail report added four names being considered by Man City to appoint as Guardiola’s successor. Girona manager Michel, Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann, Bayer Leverkusen manager Xabi Alonso and former Brighton manager Roberto De Zerbi. After an 11-year stellar career at Man City, Kompany is still regarded as one of the most influential captains in the club’s history. The former centre-back from Belgium joined City as a key player and went on to win four Premier League titles with the team. Man City job might come too early for Kompany Although his playing career was hugely successful, he still has a long way to go when it comes to football management. The Bayern Munich job, if he gets it, will be a huge test of his character and his tactical acumen. The German giants lost the league title to Alonso’s Leverkusen and Kompany will be tasked with the duty of winning the German title back. Whoever succeeds Guardiola at Man City will have a tough job as the Spaniard has managed to win silverware almost every season at the club.",

        "content": "Alexer Peres, the estranged ex-wife of Nigerian singer Harrison Okiri, aka Harrysong, has denied claims made by her ex-husband that she got pregnant for another man while they were still married. Recall that the ‘Reggae Blues’ crooner, made the claim during an Instagram Live session on May 26, 2024, when he implied that ‘cheating runs’ in the family of the mother of his kids. He also claimed in the viral clip which is making the rounds on social media that Alexer’s mother has been married multiple times and even still cheats in her present marriage. “My ex-wife’s mother just married her seventh or sixth husband yet she is still cheating in that marriage. That’s the kind of family I married into,” he began. Harrysong further said that Alexer came to him and told him she was pregnant after they had ceased having s3xual relations for over a year. He made it clear, though, that the pregnancy was not his because they hadn’t had any marital intercourse in some months.

She wrote, “Now let’s come to me. Please if you are the man or men that I had sexual relations with while I was married to Harrysong , please step forward with evidence. And if there is any way we can run a DNA on all my kids including the one I lost I am open to it because I fear nothing.” “A clear conscience fears no accusation, like I said you keep projecting your insecurities onto me. Harrison how many times did I get to treat STDs because of you. The only s3xually transmitted infections I did not get to treat weekly were HIV and hepatitis B,” she concluded.

        "description": "A private investigator from Palm Beach was the server of Rory McIlroy's divorce papers to his partner Erica Stoll at their luxury Florida home, it has been revealed",
        "content": "Rory McIlroy's divorce papers were served to his longtime partner, Erica Stoll, by a private investigator, court documents have revealed. McIlroy, a four-time major winner, filed for divorce and the enforcement of a prenuptual agreement on May 13, not long after his victory at the Wells Fargo Championship, with court filings in Palm Beach County describing the marriage to Stoll as \"irretrievably broken.\" Records show the 35-year-old digitally signed the papers at 9.06 pm and 9.08 pm EDT on May 9, and the divorce was instigated on the following Monday. According to documents filed on May 13, Carl Woods was the server who served the divorce papers to Stoll at the McIlroy family home in the exclusive Jack Nicklaus development The Bear’s Club at 10.30 am. READ MORE: Rory McIlroy's state of mind amid Erica Stoll divorce and emotional reunion READ MORE: Former NFL quarterback caught up in Rory McIlroy and Amanda Balionis romance rumours Woods' website cites his history as a police officer in Palm Beach County since 1987. He is also a certified vehicle homicide investigator, a licensed private investigator and a certified process server. Stoll was also warned she had 20 days to file a written response to her husband’s petition with the circuit court clerk, otherwise, she risks losing the case. The Belfast Telegraph claims Stoll has yet to respond. McIlroy has insisted that his focus is on winning since the news of his divorce broke. He finished T12 at the PGA Championship at the most recent major. A source told People : \"He's just trying to find himself, focus and get back to winning. [He] went through such a winning phase and hasn't done much in the last five-ish years.\" The golfer signed the documents while at the Wells Fargo Championship ( Image: Getty) McIlroy's wait for a major has spanned a decade also and the reason why the Northern Irishman has come up short has been much debated. His former Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley has suggested the four-time major winner's long wait for a fifth is down to the field being stronger, as well as psychological problems. \"There are two issues as to why he is not the player he was back then when it comes to major championships,\" McGinley said on the Golf Channel. \"The fields are stronger now. Back then, he was a young guy forging his way, and his elbows were at their pointiest. It was really a case of, 'I am on a march to be the top player in the game, so get out of my way.' He had a clear vision. As you get there and climb the mountain, can you stay there? He has done that in PGA Tour events where his win ratio of 10 per cent is fantastic compared to anyone else. Even Scottie Scheffler has only a win ratio of 8 per cent.\" McGinley, 57, continued: \"But there is no doubt that there is a psychological build-up from not getting over the line in major championships since he hasn't circumnavigated yet. I say yet because if he gets it once, I feel - maybe not - that there are certainly another three or four majors in Rory McIlroy. It is all about getting the first one. You would have to think that a golf course like this, that he has won on before, is the kind of thing that could ignite him.\"",

        "content": "The Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) on Tuesday announced it had completed the electrical system upgrades at Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal 3. In a news release, the MIAA said the second phase of the electrical system upgrade , which commenced in early April, concluded on May 28. The system upgrade was a ''continuation of the Terminal 3 electrical systems upgrade project that commenced last year,'' it said. The MIAA said it was able to complete the replacement of deteriorated medium-voltage switchgear components across eight different electrical substations within Terminal 3. The airport authority said the final segment of power-related maintenance activity began at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday and was concluded at 3 a.m. The MIAA said generator sets provided power to Terminal 3, giving priority to critical equipment and facilities to ensure continuous passenger processing and uninterrupted flight operations. “These electrical upgrades are important to us, and we are very happy with the conclusion, as it guarantees a more dependable electrical system for the terminal,” said MIAA general manager Eric Jose Ines. “We are, however, mindful of some issues in a specific area of the terminal as a result of this upgrade, and we will continue to work on these until they are fully resolved. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate everyone’s patience and understanding during this time,” said Ines, noting there was an observable lack of lighting in some parts of the terminal, such as the curbsides, hallways, and roadways. — VBL, GMA Integrated News",

In fact, the just-turned 18-year-old is doing everything in her power to move away from her parents' powerful surnames , according to her choreographer. Shiloh Jolie-Pitt is making waves in the dancing scene, and she doesn't want any help from Hollywood. Known as Shi to her pals, the teen has lived every step of her childhood in the spotlight thanks to her star-studded guardians. Now, she's quickly made a name for herself with her own skills after a video of her dancing went viral all over social media back in 2021.

Shi does not rely on her famous name to achieve her goals.\" Carter admits he didn't even know who Shi's mum and dad were, \"I don't think this matters.\" \"I understand that it can be difficult to see the person beyond her celebrity status, but I urge you to make an effort for her.

In the last period of my life, LA feels like home and I'm glad that I had the opportunity to meet so many hardworking and wonderful people. \"I'm glad every time to have you next to me in the studio, so thank you guys,\" he added.

Angelina has primary physical custody of the kids, while Brad was given visitation rights during their lengthy divorce battle.

        "content": "Speaking exclusively to for his latest Daily Briefing column, Jacobs explained the latest on the Ten Hag situation, with a decision expected this week as the club continue to conduct an internal review of the entire season under the Dutch tactician. If Ten Hag does move on, Jacobs says both Mauricio Pochettino and Thomas Tuchel are keen on the potential vacancy at Man Utd, and one imagines there are plenty of fans who’d see them as upgrades on Ten Hag, even if he has just masterminded an impressive FA Cup final victory over Manchester City. Overall, the season just gone has been far from good enough for United, who finished 8th in the Premier League table and bottom of their Champions League group, all whilst playing a pretty uninspiring brand of football. Still, it seems a decision has not been made yet, so it remains to be seen if MUFC fans will have to put up with more of Ten Hag or if they could see someone like Pochettino or Tuchel taking over. Ten Hag latest from Ben Jacobs as ex-Chelsea duo eye Man Utd job “The future of Erik ten Hag is expected to be resolved this week, and sooner rather than later. At the time of writing, the end-of-season review is being completed,” Jacobs said. “Ten Hag wants to stay at Manchester United and is hoping for quick clarity. The longer the decision takes the more uncertainty brews. “Ten Hag has some support from senior figures at Manchester United, including Jean-Claude Blanc. “The whole season will be looked at. INEOS want to make the decision disappointedly and data will help them do so. “Mauricio Pochettino and Thomas Tuchel are both keen on the Manchester United job should a vacancy emerge, but the first task is to decide on Ten Hag.” Meanwhile, Jacobs also discussed as Enzo Maresca closes in on replacing the Argentine at Stamford Bridge.",

        "content": "A FORMER Love Island star has slammed the new line up and claimed the show is \"going backwards\". Love Island returns on June 3 for a brand new series and the latest group of sexy singletons was revealed over the weekend. But many fans were left disappointed by the reveal and quickly took to social media to slam the lack of diversity . And it seems Tasha Ghouri , who shot to fame on the 2022 summer series, agrees. Tasha, 25, took to Snapchat to share an unimpressed-looking selfie and added: \"Love seeing the inclusivity in the Love Island cast... feels like we're going backwards.\" She previously made Love Island history as the first-ever deaf contestant . Tasha, who wears a cochlear implant, last year opened up about the importance of representation on the show. She said: \"Me going on the show was a groundbreaking moment for the TV industry, especially for a show like Love Island. \"It was like a moment that shook the whole earth, that's what it felt like.\" One of this year's Islanders is 24-year-old Patsy Field, who has been very open about having Erb's Palsy - a condition that means one of her arms is shorter than the other and it also has less function. The birth defect occured after Patsy was delivered naturally rather than via Caesarean section. It came about amid complications when her mother went into labour. An insider told the Mail: \"Patsy is a brilliant signing for the show, she's hilarious so will definitely bring good vibes and positive energy. \"She has never let her disability define her but she's also excited for the opportunity to educate audiences who might not know about Erb's palsy because awareness is key.\" Every year Love Island opens its doors to more sexy Islanders who are hoping for a holiday romance that could turn into more. Here we take you though all of the Love Island winners so far and what their relationship statuses are now: 2024 - The first ever All stars spin off show was won by Molly Smith and Tom Clare . STATUS: Still together. 2023 - Jess Harding and Sammy Root took home the 50K, and won the summer 2023 Love Island . STATUS: Broken up. 2023 - The first series of 2023 saw Sanam Harrinanan and Kai Fagan crowned Love Island winners in South Africa . STATUS: Still together. 2022 - Davide Sanclimenti and Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu's time in the villa was anything but a smooth ride, but they managed to win the public's hearts - and the ITV2 reality show. STATUS: Broken up. 2021 - Liam Reardon and Millie Court were announced winners of Love Island 2021. STATUS: Still together. 2020 - The first ever winter Love Island saw Paige Turley and Finn Tapp crowned winners after falling in love on the show. STATUS: Broken up. 2019 - Series 5 saw Tommy Fury and Molly-Mae Hague runners up to winners Greg O'Shea and Amber Gill, who met in the last few days of the series. STATUS: Broken up. 2018 - It wasn't surprising fan favourites Jack Fincham and Dani Dyer won the show , as they were strong throughout. But sadly things didn't last. STATUS: Broken up. 2017 - Kem Cetinay and Amber Davies had lots of ups and downs in the villa but went on to win the show . STATUS: Broken up. 2016 - Nathan Massey and Cara De La Hoyde were together form the start of the series, and since they won show have two kids and are married. STATUS: Still together. 2015 - Despite poor Jess Hayes being Max Morley's second choice on the show, they did win - but they didn't last as a couple. STATUS: Broken up.",

        "description": "The infamous Kray Twins' reign of terror didn't end after they were jailed, and one former friend of the East End gangsters recalls being given a 'hit list' of 12 names on a prison visit",
        "content": "A notorious armed robber who rubbed shoulders with most of London’s gangland “faces” in the 1960s has told how one of the handed him a “hit list” of twelve underworld rivals he wanted him to . Ronnie Field explained to podcaster that he had visited the legendary gangster in Broadmoor. He said: “Ron give me the list of people he wanted killed ...when I went back a week later, he said to me ‘Have you done any of them Ron?’ and as as we came out, one of the geeezers on the list was coming in. “He said to me ‘Ronnie’s in a good mood,’ and I thought, ‘Oh right, you’re on the death list aren’t you?’” Ronnie Field’s new book, Nefarious, is a catalogue of his long and colourful life of crime, from a £10million diamond heist to being arrested with Charlie Kray on what he insists were trumped-up drugs charges. He admits that he robbed “between 25 and 30” banks, but says that one heist would never be enough to retire on. “You don't always walk away with hundreds of thousands of pounds,” Ronnie said. “Sometimes you only come out with 10 grand or 12 grand, and then you got have to have a divvy-up between the four of you.” He says the police rarely arrived in time to catch them, but recalls one memorable incident where he fired a shotgun at a police car to scare the coppers off: “There was never any mention of it in the paper or anything, that they ran away.” Ronnie claims that he was on a Met Police death list, because he was getting away with too many crimes: “They tried to shoot us at Gatwick airport, but too many people came out of the Gatwick hotel. People come out when they heard ‘Armed police, get on the floor,’ and all that. People come out don't they? “So I put my hands on my head and and said ‘I'm unarmed, I ain't got a gun, I'm unarmed,’ and he said you bastard, Field’.” That robbery, involving some £10m worth of diamonds, saw Ronnie behind bars for three and a half years, but in total the career criminal has been locked up for 23 years, befriending the likes of Charles Bronson and Dave Courtney behind bars.",

        "content": "Bank credit growth may dip 200 basis points to 14% in the current fiscal due to revised risk weights and lower gross domestic product growth, according to Crisil Ratings. In fiscal 2024, credit growth was 16%. The major factors driving credit demand are broadly intact, along with a revival in private corporate capital expenditure towards the second half of fiscal 2025, which can help accelerate credit growth, Crisil said in a report on Tuesday. The retail segment will grow the fastest at 16%, while corporate credit—the largest segment—will see steady growth at 13%, the report said. The growth in corporate credit will be supported by private sector industrial capex in fiscal 2025, said Ajit Velonie, senior director at Crisil Ratings. \"Steel, cement, and pharmaceuticals will lead the capex recovery. Emerging sectors such as electronics and semi-conductors, electric vehicles, and solar modules will also contribute to capex, especially over the medium term,\" he said. Retail credit growth will fall to 16%, compared to 17% in fiscal 2024. But it will remain the fastest-growing segment for banks, Crisil said. \"The high-base effect, especially with the merger of HDFC Ltd. with HDFC Bank Ltd. in fiscal 2024, will also have a bearing on retail growth.\" In the current financial year, MSME segment growth may slow down to 15% from the robust 19% growth seen in fiscal 2024. A revival in downstream capex will support this segment, Crisil said. Agricultural credit growth will depend on monsoon trends but should witness a moderation due to strong fiscal 2024, it said.",

        "content": "If you're going camping or , hopefully you know to lock up your food, especially if you're leaving your campsite. In the absence of frequent bear sightings, however, it can be easy to get lazy around this rule and think that a granola bar or two inside your is no big deal. A new video that shows a black bear taking on a trash can in downtown Aspen, Colorado will hopefully change your mind about that now that is here. The clip, which you can view below, was posted to Instagram by Roaring Fork Bears, a non-profit organization that specializes in devising proactive solutions to help reduce and avoid human-bear conflicts in the Roaring Fork Valley. The organization donates bear-resistant trash cans to residents in need to help deter local bears, which are now waking up from and hungry, from making a habit of coming into residential areas in search of food. In the video, the persistent black bear is seen dragging the Kodiak KP95-HDLL trash can down a driveway, over rocks and turning it over and upside down for what appears to be at least several minutes, before slinking off defeated. \"Bears know when it's trash collection day,\" writes the RFB with the post. Videos like this one highlight just how tenacious bears can be when they detect food, and while the trash can emerged unscathed from this encounter, it should be clear that your tent will most certainly not. If you are recreating in bear country this year, be sure to know to keep your food – and any other tempting smelly items like toothpaste and flavored chapstick – off the ground at night when you're sleeping. You can also carry a if you're not expecting lots of trees. If you're in a campground with bear lockers, use them for all scented items at all times and remember to pack out all trash. Keeping your food safe from bears doesn't just mean you'll have a hot dinner to cook over your at night – it keeps local bears, yourself and other campers safe from harm.",

        "content": "SAINSBURY'S is facing a bitter row for axing its full-sugar lemonade in favour of artificially sweetened versions. The saccharine drink was one of the few left on the market which did not contain sweeteners and was red-rated for its high levels of sugar . But Sainsbury's this month branded the product a poor performer and discontinued it - causing a row to fizz up from lemon-loving purists. Customer Claire-Louise complained on X : \"Not everyone can tolerate sweeteners and some people choose to avoid them. Very disappointing.\" Another called Michaela added: \"Many people are intolerant to sweeteners or find that they trigger symptoms of existing conditions... \"There is so little choice for us since the sugar tax, your Classic lemonade was a godsend.\" And Ashlea McSorley, from Scotland , added: \"This war on sugar needs to stop.\" Classic Lemonade contained 10.6g of sugar per 100ml - more than twice as much as Schweppes and 7UP and three times more than Sainsbury’s normal lemonade, as well as Morrisons , Asda and Tesco's own-brand alternatives. Most of its rivals contain sweeteners such as saccharin, acesulfame K and aspartame, although Waitrose and M&S still sell unsweetened versions. The soft drinks industry has gradually phased out bevvies like Classic Lemonade after the so-called \"sugar tax\" was introduced in 2018. It said drinks containing between 5g and 8g of sugar per 100ml will be subject to a tax of 18p per litre, while those containing more than 8g will pay a 24p per litre levy. Health campaigner Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said of Sainsbury’s decision: “I feel for the purists but they should get over their disappointment. “Sainsbury's have done the right thing to axe the red-rated drink. Those that were hooked on their classic favourite should shop around for an alternative. It might take time for their taste buds to latch onto a new healthier flavour but they should persevere \" Soft drinks sales in the UK were up by just under 3 per cent in 2023, with low and no calorie drinks accounting for more than seven out of every 10 purchases, according to figures from GlobalData. A Sainsbury's spokesman said: “We regularly review our ranges so that we dedicate space in our stores to the products which are most popular with our customers.” Supermarkets often switch up their product offering depending on the time of year or seasonal celebrations. THERE are plenty of ways to save on your grocery shop. You can look out for yellow or red stickers on products, which show when they've been reduced. If the food is fresh, you'll have to eat it quickly or freeze it for another time. Making a list should also save you money, as you'll be less likely to make any rash purchases when you get to the supermarket. Going own brand can be one easy way to save hundreds of pounds a year on your food bills too. This means ditching \"finest\" or \"luxury\" products and instead going for \"own\" or value\" type of lines. Plenty of supermarkets run wonky veg and fruit schemes where you can get cheap prices if they're misshapen or imperfect. For example, Lidl runs its Waste Not scheme, offering boxes of 5kg of fruit and vegetables for just £1.50. If you're on a low income and a parent, you may be able to get up to £442 a year in Healthy Start vouchers to use at the supermarket too. Plus, many councils offer supermarket vouchers as part of the Household Support Fund. If you keep an eye out around at the end of seasons and around celebrations like Christmas and Easter, you can often pick up a good cut-price bargain. Retailers are known for offering big discounts on old stock they are looking to get rid of and this can include seasonal biscuits, gifts and even Easter eggs. We also spoke to shopping expert Sarah-Jane Outten on how to take advantage of the yellow sticker bonanza that can often happen around bank holidays. Supermarkets are not the only ones who like to change things up, fast food restaurants also like to keep customers guessing by shaking up their menu. McDonald's is shaking up its main menu offering tomorrow , which means there are seven favourites getting the chop. Among the items getting axed are the beloved Biscoff McFlurry and the Chicken Big Mac. Not only that but the limited edition Biscoff Frappe is also making an exit after just six weeks. The new and returning items landed on menus across the UK and Ireland on April 17. Meanwhile, we can reveal eight nostalgic foods that have disappeared from supermarket shelves over the years. There is everything from Campbell's soup to Caramac and while we won't know for sure if these loved snacks will ever come back - it is worth keeping an eye out. Also, if you are feeling sad that your favourite snack is no more, don't worry as it is not all bad news. Brands including Walkers and Nestle are putting new flavours on shelves for shoppers to try. Some brands are even getting experimental and pushing boundaries with new flavours. This could be a wacky new chocolate bar or a new flavour of crisps based on items we already know and love. Just recently, Heinz launched a pickle-flavoured ketchup , which some people described as \"fundamentally wrong\". Pringles has released ketchup flavour crisps that shoppers have been desperate to get their hands on. Plus, Cadbury has brought out a range of new items, including \"heavenly\" milkshakes inspired by iconic chocolate bars . We have pulled together a list of favourites that have recently hit the shelves and hopefully, you'll spot something new to try. Do you have a money problem that needs sorting?

        "description": "Toni Henderson, from County Durham, called her boss and asked for a few days off after winning £1M on Lotto",
        "content": "Despite a life-changing Lotto win, a hard-working mum has vowed to keep her job to be a good role model to her young son. Toni Henderson, from County Durham , revealed how her £1M win came as a huge relief after a tough few months \"living payday to payday\", alongside the news that her rent had just increased. But now the 32-year-old is able to own her own home and take her son on his first abroad holiday. The mum-of-one said: \"I am just a normal person, living payday to payday. The rent has just gone up and I live on my own. With managing the bills it was starting to get a bit of a struggle. The win will help me massively - I have so much freedom now and I feel a lot more independent. It gives my son the start he deserves and I want the money to last for our future.

I am so unbelievably grateful but it's going to take a lot of time to sink in.\" Toni's winning story started after purchasing two Lucky Dip tickets for the Lotto draw on Saturday, April 27. She revealed how she would buy Lucky Dips on \"the odd Saturday\" but didn't check the winning numbers until she woke up at 8am the next morning. The payments and admin assistant said: \"I checked one of the lines and realised I had some of the numbers. I originally thought I had matched five numbers, which was £1,700 and I was buzzing that I'd won that - it was extra money I didn't have. But when I logged into my online account it came along the top that I had won £1M. I sat there counting the zeros, shaking in bed, whilst my son was still asleep. \"I tried to ring my mum but she wasn't answering so I woke my son up and we jumped in the car to mum's. She was visibly concerned when we turned up out of the blue and kept asking what was wrong. I remember saying something like, 'I think you need to sit down' before telling her that I'd won £1M on The National Lottery - she couldn't believe it. \"She was in the middle of starting the Sunday lunch and just stood there shaking. I was on autopilot for the rest of the day and didn't sleep a wink that night.\" The following morning Toni was able to confirm the win with The National Lottery. However, Toni admitted that it still doesn't feel real, even with the money now safely in the bank. She added: \"There are no words to express how you feel. I had this excited butterfly feeling having the win officially confirmed and then seeing all of the zeros in my bank account. You sit and think about what you'd do all the time if you won, but then, when it happens, you don't know what to do. \"I did take my son shopping and we bought some toys but even then I told him certain things were too expensive. I have always had to be cautious with money so it doesn't feel right to spend lots on things I wouldn't have bought before. I am not a materialistic person, even now I find a pair of trainers over £100 far too expensive.\" Toni said following her win she sent a text to her manager and asked if he would call her. After announcing that she had won £1M, some employers would probably expect a resignation to follow. However, Toni asked if she could have a few days off to process the news and revealed that she had full intentions to return to work. She said: \"I want to keep working - it gives my son a good upbringing and he can learn the value of working hard. My mum has always worked and I want him to have a good mindset and learn that for the nice things in life, you have to earn them. \"I want to be a good role model for him. I have worked since the age of 17 - I would be bored and lost if I didn't work.\" She added: \"I eventually want to buy a house and I have been looking at new cars and settled on a Kia Sportage in the end, which I love! You think you're going to get a flash one when you win, but I quickly realised that really isn't me. I am just happy with the prospect of a new car - that's a first for me!\" \"I'm not a greedy person - I just want to help others really. I've helped out family members and I want to do something special for my mum and dad. No amount of money can repay them for all they have done for me. \"I am also going to take my son to Disney World Florida. You only live once and he has never been abroad. That is a one-off trip that I wouldn't have been able to do before the win. I get a lot of comfort out of helping others – that's what I get a buzz out of.\" Toni bought her winning Lotto ticket online via the National Lottery website. The winning Lotto numbers on Saturday 27 April were: 2, 15, 18, 25, 57, 58 and the Bonus Ball was 53.

        "content": "LOADING ERROR LOADING AZUSA, Calif. (AP) — An 81-year-old man who investigators say terrorized a Southern California neighborhood for years with a slingshot has been arrested, police said. While conducting an investigation, detectives “learned that during the course of 9-10 years, dozens of citizens were being victimized by a serial slingshot shooter,” the Azusa Police Department said in a statement. Advertisement The man is suspected of breaking windows and car windshields and of narrowly missing people with ball bearings shot from a slingshot, the statement said. No injuries were reported. The man was arrested Thursday after officers served a search warrant and found a slingshot and ball bearings at his home in Azusa, about 25 miles (40 km) east of Los Angeles, police said. Azusa police Lt. Jake Bushey said Saturday that detectives learned that most of the ball bearings were shot from the suspect’s backyard. “We’re not aware of any kind of motive other than just malicious mischief,” Bushey told the Southern California News Group .

        "content": "A bear broke into a home in California on May 24 — just to steal Oreos, which is believed to be its favourite snack. Residents in the area, who have had many encounters with bears before, have even christened this particular bear, \"Oreo\". The bear's antics were widely reported by U.S. media. Footage of the incident showed the bear breaking into the home through a window. It later emerged with a blue pack of Oreo cookies dangling from its mouth. \"I was scared to death,\" a neighbour said. \"He was so close. That never happened before.\" Not that this was the first Oreo hunt for Oreo the bear. The same bear struck a week earlier at the same home by picking out a pack of Oreos from the family car, which contained other groceries. via ABC7 The bear was described in another news bulletin as \"cute\" but \"potentially dangerous\", and \"unfazed by the people nearby watching in awe\". Residents' encounters with bears have been part of life in the Californian city of Monrovia. The neighbour interviewed added that she had a similar encounter in 2023 when a bear, reportedly a different one, broke into her garage and took a chocolate cake from her refrigerator after rummaging through it. \"Now that he actually broke into the house, it's a bit scary,\" the neighbour said. \"I feel like I can't leave a window open even with a screen because he literally took the screen out, so that's a little alarming for me.\" The bear's apparent emboldened ways have become jarring for the human inhabitants of Monrovia, who live along Canyon Crest Drive. Another resident in the neighbourhood said: \"For the last 10 years, particularly the bears, have become more bold and have assumed more territories as their own.\" Top photos via ABC7",

        "description": "Tennis star Jessica Pegula is the heiress to a £5bn fortune which would make her five times wealthier than the world's two greatest footballers – Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi – combined",
        "content": "Tennis ace Jessica Pegula is worth an extraordinary five times more than Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi combined. Pegula, ranked fifth in the world rankings, is set to inherit the fortune of her father Terry - one of America's wealthiest businessmen. While the billions of pounds in question are not in her name just yet, the 30-year-old has long been dubbed the 'world's richest tennis player'. Her parents own a sports empire that includes NFL franchise Buffalo Bills and the NHL's Buffalo Sabres, having previously owned other Buffalo-based sports teams like the Beauts and the Bandits. Yet the majority of their colossal fortune comes from Terry's ventures in the oil and gas industries. As of May 2024, Forbes estimated his net worth at an astounding £5.32bn. And their staggering wealth has enabled them to own luxuries such as a £14million superyacht named 'Top Five II' and a £2.5m gated mansion in Florida. Cristiano Ronaldo can't resist brash boast as Man Utd icon sets new record Emotional Rafael Nadal suffers first-round defeat on likely French Open farewell Pegula herself isn't just resting on her laurels either. She has amassed a personal net worth of £9.4m through a successful tennis career, mainly accumulated from prize money and sponsorships. She recently added another £146,294 to her total by reaching the quarterfinals at the Miami Open. But it’s fair to say she wouldn't be topping any rich lists without the billions she stands to inherit. In comparison, Ronaldo and Messi, the two greatest footballers of this century, have a combined worth of just over £1bn. Portuguese icon Ronaldo's fortune is estimated at a whopping £470m, as per Celebrity Net Worth . His 21-year long career in the sport has seen him earn substantial sums through various sponsorships, including a lifetime partnership with Nike and deals with Herbalife, Tag Heuer, and Clear Haircare. Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the wealthiest athletes on the planet ( Image: (Image: Getty)) His earnings received a significant boost when he penned a reported £172m-per-year contract for two-and-a-half years with Saudi Arabian outfit Al-Nassr in January 2023. Even so, Ronaldo once again finds himself trailing behind his eternal rival Messi, who boasts a net worth of around £554m. The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner also has a lifelong deal with Adidas, his own clothing line, and partnerships with Pepsi, Gatorade, and Budweiser among others. Messi declined an eye-watering £1.4bn offer to sign for Saudi giants Al-Hilal in 2023, opting instead for a £128m contract over two-and-a-half years with David Beckham's Inter Miami. The deal will also grant him future equity stake in the team, meaning he will continue to earn dividends even post-retirement. Lionel Messi is worth half a billion ( Image: (Image: Getty)) Meanwhile, Pegula recently pulled out of Roland Garros due to persistent injury issues, having made it to the semi-final of the doubles tournament in Paris last year. She vented her frustration at being labelled the 'world's richest tennis player' on Netflix series Break Point in 2023, opening up about the drawbacks of her family's immense wealth. She admitted: \"Some people get this image that it's really easy for me because my dad is very wealthy but that didn't happen until I was 17 or 18. My dad was probably more hard on me and instilled a lot of work ethic in me. That definitely got me to this point. \"I hate when people write horrible stuff on social media or online. I don't think I owe anything to prove those people wrong. I don't care but, at the same time, there's definitely really dark moments where I'm like, what am I doing? Why am I doing this? I'm just putting myself through the same thing over and over again and it sucks.\" Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

By Monday afternoon, police said they have identified a “few suspects” and that “there is no credible or ongoing threat to the middle school community at this time.” “Our investigation has progressed, and we have identified a small number of potential suspects in relation to the phone call threat on Friday,” Browne said. “We remain confident with our earlier assessment of there being no credible and ongoing threat within the school district.” Students did not have school due to Memorial Day on Monday. As they are expected to return Tuesday, police have decided to increase their visible presence “out of an abundance of caution.” “Notwithstanding our assessment and out of an abundance of caution, the Burlington Police will provide a visible presence at all Burlington Public Schools on Tuesday.

The accused also allegedly tonsured the man’s head and made him wear a garland of shoes, they said. The incident took place in neighbouring Rajasthan on May 22, but as the man was kidnapped from Guna, an FIR was registered at the Fatehgarh police station here against seven persons late Monday night, Superintendent of Police (SP) Sanjeev Sinha said. The accused persons had also shot a video of the torture, shared it on social media and demanded Rs 25 lakh from the man, as per a complaint lodged by him.

They also shot videos of the inhuman treatment and demanded Rs 25 lakh from him. When police came to know about it, the accused set the man free on the condition that he would pay them Rs 20 lakh within three days, he said. SP Sinha said, “We have taken cognisance of the incident. The complainant came to me following which I sent him to Fatehgarh police station. He was beaten up in Rajasthan but as the crime of kidnapping him took place here, a case was registered in Guna district in the matter.” The FIR was registered against seven persons under various Indian Penal Code sections, including 506 (criminal intimidation), 365 (kidnapping) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of a common intention), Singh said. Reacting to the incident, the opposition Congress in a post on X claimed Chief Minister Mohan Yadav was unable to handle the state and his (home) department and demanded his resignation.

        "description": "The Science, Innovation and Technology Committee said the £10 million allocated to regulators was ‘insufficient’.",
        "content": "The Science, Innovation and Technology Committee said in a report into the governance of AI that £10 million announced by the Government in February to help Ofcom and other regulators respond to the growth of the technology was “clearly insufficient”. It added that the next government should announce further financial support “commensurate to the scale of the task”, as well as “consider the benefits of a one-off or recurring industry levy” to help regulators. Outgoing committee chairman Greg Clark said he was “worried” that UK regulators were “under-resourced compared to the finance that major developers can command”. The report, published on Tuesday, also expressed concern at suggestions the new AI Safety Institute has been unable to access some developers’ models to perform pre-deployment safety testing that was intended to be a major focus of its work. The committee has called on the next government to name any developers that refused access — in contravention of the agreement at the November 2023 summit at Bletchley Park — and report their justification for refusing. It adds that the Government and regulators should safeguard the integrity of the election campaign by taking “stringent enforcement action” against online platforms hosting deepfake content which “seeks to exert a malign influence on the democratic process”. Former business secretary Mr Clark said it was important to test the outputs of AI models for biases “to see if they have unacceptable consequences”, as biases “may not be detectable in the construction of models”. Commenting on the report, Mr Clark said: “The Bletchley Park summit resulted in an agreement that developers would submit new models to the AI Safety Institute. “We are calling for the next government to publicly name any AI developers who do not submit their models for pre-deployment safety testing. “It is right to work through existing regulators, but the next government should stand ready to legislate quickly if it turns out that any of the many regulators lack the statutory powers to be effective. “We are worried that UK regulators are under-resourced compared to the finance that major developers can command.” In its report, the committee states that the “most far-reaching challenge” of AI may be the way it can operate as a “black box” – in that the basis of, and reasoning for, its output may be unknowable. The MPs add that if a chain of reasoning cannot be viewed, there must be stronger testing of the outputs of AI models as a means to assess their power and acuity. The committee states that the conclusions and recommendations of the report apply to whoever is in government after the General Election on July 4. In its last report of the current Parliament on the topic, the committee writes: “It is important that the timing of the General Election does not stall necessary efforts by the Government, developers and deployers of AI to increase the level of public trust in a technology that has become a central part of our everyday lives.” It adds that any new government should be ready to produce AI-specific legislation should the current approach “prove insufficient to address current and potential future harms associated with the technology”. The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said the UK was taking steps to regulate AI and upskilling regulators as part of a wider £100 million funding package.",

        "content": "NORRISTOWN — As construction nears completion on the first phase of the Elmwood Park Zoo’s new welcome center, plaza and veterinary hospital , officials took a moment to honor a lasting legacy. People gathered on May 22 to conduct a ceremonial flag-raising situated at the entrance to the zoo’s new entrance plaza. There they commemorated Dave Wilson, who was a “beloved long-time employee, friend and Army veteran.” “This is something that he really would have loved. He was a simple man. He loved this town, he loved his country, he loved the zoo. ... He would really, really love this,” said Wilson’s daughter, Diane Brown. In a submitted photo, Dave Wilson is pictured in front of an Elmwood Park Zoo sign. (Photo courtesy Elmwood Park Zoo staff) Family members of Dave Wilson are pictured following a ceremonial flag raising at the Elmwood Park Zoo honoring his memory. Pictured, from left, are Ruthann Scarafone, Jerry and Diane Brown, Joanne Smith, as well as long time friend Michelle Manella.

(Rachel Ravina – MediaNews Group) Wilson’s family members and loved ones were present at the mid-week ceremony, which concluded with a musical performance. Wilson’s friend, Michelle Manella, underscored the importance of dedicating the flag to someone who played such an important role in the community. “He would feel so honored by this, and that was something incredibly important to him,” Manella said. “So to be flying this high above the zoo, I feel like he feels like he’d be looking over us. He looked over so many people here, whether it was summer staff or people that worked here all the time, he always looked over everybody. That was Mr. Wilson. That’s what he did.” “He was the first one here,” she continued. “A lot of times he was the last one here, and he looked over everybody, young or old, and I feel like dedicating something like that looking over the zoo is like him looking over us and just watching the zoo.” Established in 1924, the Norristown-based zoo has around 300 animals, with visitors ranging from 800,000 to 1 million people each year. When cultivating a comprehensive $150 million master plan for the zoo, revamping the welcome center and the veterinary hospital was the first step. A $30 million donation was designated back in October 2022 to fund the project and construction began in April 2023. Officials are expected to get together again next week to cut the ribbon on the zoo’s first phase of development, showcasing the welcome center and Frank and Paige Engro Veterinary Health Center. “All of our guests will walk through the space and learn why zoos matter. Why are they here, meaning the animals, why are we here, meaning the staff, and why are you here, meaning our guests,” said Elmwood Park Zoo CEO and Executive Director Al Zone. Zone addressed members of the Norristown Municipal Council earlier this week to update them on the progress on the 39,000-square-foot space that features $41 million “worth of improvements.” The Elmwood Park Zoo is one of 238 institutions accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. “We are already being nominated — has to be open for at least six months — we are already being nominated as the best entrance to any zoo in the entire United States, which is really excit(ing),” Zone said. Along with expanded parking at the zoo, the welcome center includes several amenities including a gift shop and restrooms. Highlighting the zoo’s veterinary hospital, Zone noted that windows were incorporated so that patrons inside the welcome center could witness medical procedures. The hospital area contains computed tomography scans, which Zone said only two other facilities in the country have, San Diego Zoo and Disney’s Animal Kingdom. Referencing future educational opportunities, Zone added the zoo plans to partner with the nearby Central Montco Technical High School to launch a vet-tech program. Following completion of the development’s first phase, additional plans include an overall campus expansion across the creek, the construction of a pedestrian bridge, as well as Asia and South America exhibits, officials previously said. Ideas to beautify Harding Boulevard and incorporate stormwater improvements were also proposed. Norristown council members unanimously authorized the advertisement of two ordinances during the May 21 meeting related to the zoo’s ongoing development. “The proposed ordinances are to aid the Elmwood Park Zoo’s expansion project by streamlining the zoning process for two pieces of their plan (impervious coverage and fences). Planning officials have worked with the project developers and the municipal engineer to encourage development for this one specific use – the zoo – while not hindering environmental or safety concerns to the community,” said Norristown Public Information Officer Kevin Tustin in a statement Friday afternoon. It’s unclear when these ordinances will be up for a vote. The next Norristown Municipal Council meeting is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. on June 4 at Municipal Hall, 235 E. Airy St. Visit norristown.org for more information.",

        "description": "Rachel’s Talybont 1st XI 88 all out (22.2 overs) Lampeter XI 89 /3 (16.2 overs). Lampeter XI win by 7 wickets",
        "content": "LAMPETER produced another impressive performance to achieve back to back home wins in the Fine and Country West Wales Cricket Club Conference Championship, on a rain affected day. Despite the forecast heavy showers, the players arrived at a sunny dry ground. The Lampeter squad looked resplendent in their new playing kits sponsored by Kekkal Retail, The Nags Head and Phillip Jones Financial Solutions only to be met with a tremendous downpour twenty minutes before the scheduled start time. Star bowler Khare leads Aberystwyth to victory South Wales Cricket Association: perfect start to Aberystwyth's debut season Solid improvement by Aberystwyth CC Women and Girls Dylan Lewis smashes Ras yr Hafod five-mile course record After some debate about the possibility of completing a match safely, with further showers likely, the captains agreed to a reduced over match of 25 apiece, in order to give the game its best chance of reaching a conclusion. This would prove vital in the end as time remaining to complete the match would come into the reckoning. So it was that half an hour late, Vinod Matthew of Talybont called incorrectly and Arif Saad asked them to bat first on a damp artificial track. Ben Harper and Joshy Thomas opened the batting and were building a solid partnership until the introduction of first change bowler Carwyn Gregson had immediate impact- Harper feathering a lifter to wicketkeeper Nicky Williams. That brought the dangerous Mohit Mathur to the middle and he immediately showed his potential with a crunching four to get off the mark. The wicket however had lifted Lampeter and Jason Davies, who had bowled with threat throughout, finally got reward in his fifth and final over. Mohit looked to drive a swinging delivery and nicked behind to fall for 6. Titus Matthew came out at four and after getting off the mark with a two feathered a leg side delivery to the diving Williams to give him his third catch and Davies his second wicket. As they had the previous week, Lampeter managed to maintain the pressure when on top and take crucial wickets in consecutive overs- Gregson backing up Davies with the wicket of Bava Vasu for 0, Neil Harris in the covers holding on to a firmly struck blow. A precarious position for Talybont turned calamitous as a mix-up between the runners in Arif Saad’s first over left Phil Abraham stranded and Hugo Douglas able to break the stumps on the run. Joshy remained and was joined by Graison John but it was Carwyn Gregson again who did the damage- trapping Joshy (24) in front with a skidding delivery to leave Talybont 48/6 and in big trouble. It was at this point that the heavens opened and the players huddled under cover to wait out the rain. After 45 minutes delay, the captains agreed to take an early tea interval as there looked little prospect of resuming imminently. As players made use of the facilities kindly provided by Canolfan Lles Llambed, the captains discussed the likelihood of getting a completed match. There was plenty of time remaining in which to complete the game but with a wet outfield, players welfare was also under consideration. It was agreed that if play could resume by 3.30pm with no further interruptions then the teams would try once more to complete the match. Luckily, through the efforts of the Lampeter team to get the grass down and with the sun emerging and a brisk breeze, the outfield quickly began to dry. Play resumed at 3.20pm as Lampeter looked to wrap up the Talybont innings. Gregson resumed where he had left off, taking yet another wicket in his final over - Graison edging to keeper Williams to give Carwyn his fourth wicket and Nicky his fourth catch. The experienced Vinod Matthew had a task to shepherd the tail to guide Talybont to a total which they could defend. He built a partnership of 15 with Sagar until Hugo Douglas held a sharp return catch off his own bowling to dismiss the number 9 for a valuable 10 runs. Captain Arif Saad turned back to opening bowler Daryl Davies to try to finish things off and Daryl duly obliged with his first ball, Vinod edging behind to give Nicky bach his fifth catch of the innings- a memorable return to the side for the veteran gloveman. Rajesh and Joby were the final pair, looking to push Talybont over the 100 mark but Hugo Douglas produced a pearler to bowl Rajesh for 4 and close the Talybont innings on 88 all out. In bright sunshine Lampeter began their reply confidently. The opening pair of Ceri Thomas and Neil Harris had proceeded to 29 in the seventh over before Graison had Ceri LBW for 2. Harris looked in fine form, picking up quickly on anything on his legs and finding the gaps in the off side. The loss of Bedwyr Davies for 0 however left Lampeter at 44/2 in the ninth over- an almost identical situation to where Rachel’s had been at the same stage of their innings. Elgan Evans joined Harris and prevented a similar collapse from happening. The pair combined powerful stroke play - Evans hitting a sweet six over mid off- with patience to see off the good balls and advance the score to 73. As Talybont’s hopes faded, Harris top edged to Bava Vasu to give Joby a wicket. Harris’ 30 runs had broken the back of the chase and Carwyn Gregson and Elgan Evans (26*) saw Lampeter home with nearly nine overs to spare. Player of the match was a close call with Nicky Williams taking five catches behind the stumps but with 4/20, all crucial top order wickets, Carwyn Gregson took the award. Lampeter move to second in the WWCCC table and will look to maintain their winning streak against Aberystwyth at home next Saturday. Talybont will hope to get their title challenge back on track with victory against AU Commoners at the Vicarage Fields.",

        "description": "This election year marks three decades since the country defeated apartheid. But we still haven’t fully healed",
        "content": "I attended the funeral of Peter Magubane, the legendary South African photojournalist. He had lived to the age of ninety-one, beating out an apartheid state determined to kill him because of his work. He was part of my mother’s extended family. Growing up, I called him Mkhulu, meaning grandfather. His was an official provincial funeral, attended by high-ranking dignitaries including President Cyril Ramaphosa, who read the eulogy. Before the service, I’d had an idea of the dangerous conditions Mkhulu Peter operated under, but I was still shocked to learn the true extent of the violence the state had meted out against him. Police beat him many times, broke his nose, and at one point, while he was detained, his house was destroyed in a fire. Starting in 1969, he was locked up for 586 days of solitary confinement. After his release, he was banned from taking photographs for five years, an order with which he refused to comply. During the funeral, these experiences were rightly listed as proof of his exceptional character, heroism, and commitment to fighting apartheid. Sitting in the congregation, I kept thinking that no matter how brave and honourable Mkhulu Peter was, he had to have come back to his family a very different person after his solitary confinement. How much healing and help was he able to access to process his traumatic experiences? But, that day, Ramaphosa, who is also president of the African National Congress—the liberation movement that became Nelson Mandela’s political party, which has been in power for the past three decades—kept to the talking points I had heard at so many funerals and celebrations during that time. To me, the ANC’s repeated hearkening back to the past, when they were the clear heroes, shows how unable they are to handle what the party has become. Now, in an election year that marks democratic South Africa’s thirtieth anniversary, I think it’s fair to say that most South Africans are disappointed by the trajectory of our democracy. Many young voters born after apartheid, known as “born frees,” see the ANC as a failed governing party—one whose history as a victorious liberation movement has been cemented in public discourse and school curricula, but one that is increasingly irrelevant to them. During the last national election, in 2019, less than half of South Africans voted, granting the ANC a 57.5 percent majority. This year, a poll in February showed the ANC sitting at less than 40 percent of prospective votes. This could be a sign of a maturing democracy and diversifying political system, but against the backdrop of other information that has come to light, it seems to show how public confidence in the ruling party has declined. Scandal after scandal has awakened South Africans to the true extent of ANC-led state capture, which has gutted our national institutions and coffers. The findings of the Zondo Commission, a nearly four-year public inquiry into state corruption, implicated a number of high-ranking ANC parliamentarians, including former president Jacob Zuma. The ANC’s own integrity commission recommended that ninety-seven members be left off the party’s ballot list this year because of their implication in the Zondo Commission’s findings. In recent years, international publications, whose headlines once trumpeted South Africa’s success story, have been publishing their own analyses and probes into the question “What went wrong?” How did Mandela’s dream descend into a nightmare of abject poverty, violent crime, persistent inequality, and struggling education systems, health care, and public services? The most compelling question to me is how the ANC, once the respected home of South Africa’s greatest political minds, became a farce. The ANC—and the decades-long anti-apartheid mass movement of which it was a part—has been intertwined with almost every aspect of my family’s history for close to a century. I was almost six years old when the country held its first democratic elections. When I think back on the past thirty years, I realize that you don’t remember history by what was or was not happening. You remember how it felt. And those feelings can serve as records, just as valid as any official account in any history book, if we can only be brave enough to hold them up to the light and really look at them. funeral took place the day before South Africa’s legal team appeared at the International Court of Justice, in The Hague, to present a case arguing that Israel’s military actions against Palestinians in Gaza are genocidal. I was moved to tears watching an Al Jazeera broadcast of Palestinians gathered around a statue of Nelson Mandela in Ramallah while the South African national anthem played. Our flag was hoisted outside the Bethlehem municipality. On social media, South Africans expressed their pride at the work of our minister of international relations and co-operation, Naledi Pandor, who led the delegation at The Hague. I found myself recalling the early days of our new political dispensation in 1994. Despite all signs at the time pointing to imminent civil war, Mandela led a broken, divided nation through peaceful democratic elections. The Rainbow Nation, as we came to be called, defied the world’s fears and expectations. My mother, Gugu, had grown up in exile, helping her parents staple and pass out ANC fliers when her family lived in Zambia and suburban Connecticut. My father, Diliza Jr., was jailed for his student activism, at twenty-one, and spent some time in solitary confinement. His father, Diliza Sr., was one of Mandela’s close friends and a fellow member of the early ANC Youth League. Diliza Sr. was riding shotgun the day Mandela first spotted his future wife, Winnie Madikizela, at a bus stop and immediately fell for her beauty. My sisters and I grew up having to entertain ourselves during weekends at Aunt or Uncle So-and-So’s houses, where my parents attended hours-long ANC meetings. In 1991, the Group Areas Act, which had legalized racially segregated neighbourhoods, was abolished; soon afterward, we moved to our first house in the suburbs, where we were the only Black family on our street. On the eve of the 1994 election, I remember my father coming home with a giant framed ANC poster, which he hung right in the middle of our entrance hall. It was a picture of Mandela sitting with a group of smiling children, with the slogan “A Better Life for All.” At the time, I was too young to appreciate what it might have meant to my father to be able to give the ANC colours and Mandela’s image pride of place in his home. For so many years, it had been dangerous to even mention the man’s name. My memories of the initial project of rebuilding the nation are those of a celebratory public process. We cleared away many memorials and symbols of apartheid and replaced them with monuments to the new national heroes credited with destroying the system. As schoolchildren, we learned about the country’s political history and about men like Mandela, Magubane, and their contemporaries who shared a vision of a free South Africa and a willingness to sacrifice for it. Public holidays like Youth Day and Human Rights Day were declared. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established to deal with the task of exposing the former machinery’s many crimes, including torture, kidnapping, and murder. The TRC hearings, which ran for four years, explored ways to compensate victims and hold perpetrators accountable through restorative, non-penal measures. In my view, the TRC largely failed in its mandate. Apartheid lasted for forty-six years. It was, by design, as much a system of personal, emotional, mental, and relational disruption as it was a legal and economic one. The massive scope of its crimes could not reasonably have been dealt with within the time frame of the commission. There was no public process to address the daily degradation and loss of dignity from injustices such as land dispossession, the migrant labour economy, pass laws, the racially segregated Bantu education system, and the Dop system, which legalized paying labourers with wine. So that healing work was relegated to the private sphere. Individuals and families grappled with psychological and emotional scars so deep that they are often mistaken for personal, familial, or racial traits. When I ask myself, “What went wrong?,” that is my answer. Apartheid didn’t end with those who fought it decades ago; it lives on through intergenerational trauma. The numbers alone are shocking enough: epidemic levels of sexual and domestic violence against women and children and a homicide rate of forty-two murders per 100,000 people in 2021—about four times higher than the average rate for regions the World Bank categorizes as “fragile and conflict affected.” Those statistics both point to and obscure the many ways South Africans need to heal our generational legacy. We often talk about how we need better legal systems to address violent crimes today; we don’t talk as much about how we become a society where such crimes are no longer rampant—a society that is able to confront and heal the scars of so many generations of dysfunction. For me, making sense of our history stemmed from a healing process I began in my early thirties. I started going to therapy and reading books about childhood and trauma. I wanted to understand why my parents, who had achieved their dreams of freedom and prosperity for themselves and their family against all odds, sometimes seemed—in my view—mentally and emotionally stuck in a bad place. We engaged in all the public activities of a happy family: dinners, vacations, spirited intellectual debates. Not from a place of pretence, I believe, but from one of true effort. Our emotional life was distant and tense; to me, my parents seemed much more comfortable expressing negative emotions than positive ones. My father could be intellectually engaging and physically affectionate but also emotionally unavailable and volatile. I remember him as demanding and controlling, imposing rules that struck me as arbitrary. Fun outings, bedtime routines, unexpected treats, and tickles were rare. It was my mother’s ways of enabling my father that set me down the path of self-healing. She’d often excuse his behaviour with the usual “He loves you but” and refer to some of the difficult things he’d gone through in prison and at the hands of the apartheid government as explanations for why he was so emotionally damaged. My childhood mistakes (not finishing all of my dinner, talking back) sparked cruel, outsized reactions in him, as though my acting out were part of a plot to destroy him. Looking back, his distrust of me seemed almost like a form of paranoia. If my mother was the “safer” parent, it was because she was there for me day to day and was far more approachable. But, though my mom did not go through the obvious, quantifiable traumas like arrest or solitary confinement, that does not mean the system left her life unharmed. Childhood instability and family separation are shared experiences across my extended family. The reasons for them were always tied to striving toward the best outcomes under a system that forced people to make hard decisions. My mother endured a long period of separation from her father when he went to the US on a student scholarship. The South African government prevented him from returning, so the rest of the family eventually joined him. My mother has told me of the shock of being transplanted into a completely new country. She and her sisters arrived in the United States not knowing how to speak English and never having been so close with white people. As the eldest of four girls, she took on a lot of responsibility to help her parents and siblings with the transition. Throughout their lives, my parents survived terrifying near misses and goodbyes that could have easily ended up being permanent. When they got together, in the 1980s, it was during the dying years of apartheid, when the state and the resistance movements had both ramped up their battles. While navigating the normal newlywed challenges of starting a family, they were also dealing with police harassment, my father’s banning orders—which restricted his movements and ability to gather with people—and an increasingly tense political climate. In 1988, the year I was born, South Africa was under a state of emergency that lasted four years. One day, while my pregnant mother was home, with my sisters playing outside, a tear gas canister landed in the front yard of their home. After that, it was decided that my mother and sisters would travel to the US so that my mother could be with her parents and give birth to me in a safer environment. My father stayed behind in South Africa. We returned a few months later. To me, this story explains the heightened sense of anxiety my mother raised me with. She is fun, worldly, and stylish, and she always encouraged me to embrace life and see the world just like she did in her youth. But she also had a tendency to catastrophize and panic at the slightest pressure, which often left me choosing to just deal with things on my own growing up. Similarly, I came to realize that telling stories about the past was pretty much the most my parents could or would do to participate in my process of confronting it. In order not to engage with my future children the way that my parents had with me, I wanted to face my historical pain. I started to apply that self-examination to understand how our country has continued to be such a terrifying place. in the election poster, Nelson Mandela’s love of children was well documented throughout his presidency. The majority of his philanthropic work was focused on children, and his delight in their presence shone through in person and in photographs. But, in his autobiography, , the statesman wrote of his regrets about his extended absences from his own children’s lives because of his activism, incarceration, and eventual presidency. His daughter Makaziwe has also spoken of the distress the siblings suffered because of their father’s absence. Leading up to the thirtieth anniversary of Mandela’s election as the public father of the nation, some of the most shocking news stories about his legacy have been about his private life. In recent years, members of his family have publicly battled over the right to auction some personal items, including his hearing aids and ID document. His former homes are falling into disrepair due to neglect. Not even the greatest among us is exempt from needing community support and space to struggle openly. I hope that understanding sets the agenda for the next few decades of continuing to shape this dynamic, hard-won young democracy of ours. It may not be possible for our current crop of leaders to engage with concepts like healing, pain, and trauma—which are coded as ephemeral, unsubstantiated, and unrelated to the work of governance. But, when millions of people are expected to seek private, individualized solutions to such a widespread problem, how can the issue not touch on governance? Cyril Ramaphosa and some of the other officials who attended Mkhulu Peter’s funeral are the same political minds who began their careers thirty years ago, full of promise and with the confidence of the nation. As I watched them give their speeches and pay their respects in January, they seemed at once weak and immovable—gripping tightly to power out of sheer desperation and myopic egos. There is an isiZulu song whose lyrics go, “Sasingenjena, soniwa ngabantu. Sasingenjena, basiphendula inhliziyo.” . In my increasingly rare moments of compassionate consideration for Ramaphosa and his comrades, I think about how South Africa let down those young heroes just as much as—or even because—we tirelessly celebrated their accomplishments. Perhaps they also let themselves down by masculinizing transformation and reconciliation processes to the point that there weren’t enough alternative voices and perspectives to bring the often feminized, privatized work of healing to the national agenda. Beyond voting in the upcoming election, there is much ownership to be taken and work to be done on our parts—the work of deciding and pursuing who we want to be as a people, what we want it to to be South African. These issues don’t fit neatly into a campaign-trail talking point like crime or public services. When I started my own process of healing, I was keen to share it with my parents and my sisters. I wanted it to draw us closer together. I’ve learned, however, that the five of us understand and remember in our own ways. Some prefer to focus on the heroism and happy endings. The bravery and greatness we are descended from that got us to where we are now, against difficult odds. Digging into the ways things didn’t turn out okay just feels too threatening. Pointless, even. But I see this difficult, often ugly process of tending to the lasting wounds as my way of honouring all who came before me. Of completing the work.",

From April next year, drivers of electric vehicles will be required to pay Vehicle Excise Duty as the government aims to make the system of motoring taxation \"fairer\". A new Tax and Regulation Manifesto from the Association of Fleet Professionals (AFP) called for changes ahead of the 2024 General Election taking place on July 4. The AFP manifesto warns the plan would be unwise amid a push for net-zero. They added: \"We would like to see VED kept at zero for electric vans in a move to aid businesses with their transition to eLCVs.\" The manifesto states: \"Ideally we’d like to see the BIK Tax Tables published to 2030 to provide certainty and peace of mind for fleets ordering vehicles with four-year contracts that will fall into the 2029/30 tax year.\" READ MORE Brits in Spain and Portugal told to prepare for 'dramatic' shift starting today The report added: \"We also believe that tax breaks should be offered to employees who decide to leave their car at home and undertake an alternative, zero carbon journey instead – be it walking, cycling or e-scooting. \"The Netherlands offer tax breaks for walking and cycling. These benefits should be offered for both commuting to the office and for business trips.\" Chief executive David Wells stressed that focusing on investment and growth in the logistics industry would bring dividends for the UK’s whole economy. “Whether manufacturing or retail, healthcare or education, every part of our economy relies upon logistics to provide all the goods needed to generate business and growth,” explained Wells. “Innovative, integrated infrastructure backed by a national logistics network will deliver efficiencies and opportunities that can benefit us all. “Giving logistics a voice at the heart of Government would ensure that the needs of industry and business are heard, and that our sector can work with government to drive up the country’s productivity.”",

        "content": "Tuesday, May 28, 2024 Swiipr, a travel paytech company revolutionizing the airline industry’s outdated and inefficient disruption payment systems, has secured £6 million in Series A funding. This funding round was led by Octopus Ventures and will support the company’s next phase of growth. As the world’s first airline-specialized payments platform, Swiipr enables airlines to digitize disruption payments, significantly enhancing the passenger experience and reducing costs by up to 60%. Launched in 2020, Swiipr is already used by 26 airlines across 70 countries, including a major flag carrier whose 4,000 staff use the platform in over 167 airports globally. Each year, an estimated 500 million global passengers are affected by flight disruptions, costing airlines billions of dollars in payouts, as well as causing significant customer dissatisfaction, reputational damage, and regulatory fines. This makes compensation a critical issue for airline boards. Traditional paper vouchers are time-consuming to process, susceptible to fraud, unpopular with retailers and passengers, and environmentally unsustainable. Bank transfers can take months to process, physical cash is insecure and costly to handle at airports, and loyalty points and future travel vouchers are often unpopular. Swiipr’s integrated digital platform includes virtual and physical prepaid compensation cards and a mobile app, providing airlines with the tools needed to address these challenges for both themselves and passengers while fully complying with the latest passenger rights regulations. For passengers, Swiipr offers the Swiipr Compensation Card, which allows airlines to distribute funds directly at the point of disruption (such as denied boarding or lost luggage), and the Swiipr Welfare Card, which enables instant distribution of food and beverage payments when flights are delayed. These cards provide instant, secure, and compliant payouts in a streamlined, digital format with universal retail compatibility. The platform also helps airlines reduce fraud and processing times, boost loyalty through personalized offers, and gain critical customer retail insights. Additionally, airlines can use Swiipr’s card products for operational and crisis payments for their staff and crew during trips and delays. TX Ventures and Solano Partners supported Octopus Ventures in the funding round. The capital will be used to develop Swiipr’s strategy, product, and technology, including investments in R&D, AI, and data analytics, to drive international airline market growth. Tara Spielhagen, Co-founder and CEO of Swiipr said: “Legacy compensation systems are unfit for purpose. Not only do they cost an airline billions of dollars every year but they also exacerbate disruption and stress. It doesn’t need to be this way in a digital age, and we are proud to have developed a new solution that solves so many pain points. Our airline partners and their customers are already reaping the benefits” Co-founder and Chairman of Swiipr, Ian Clowes added : “Swiipr solves a real live global issue for airlines which is only going to become more challenging with climate change. Now, thanks to Octopus, our Series A capital will enable us to enhance our solutions even further and accelerate our growth helping us to achieve our vision of eliminating compensation friction points wherever they exist”. Tosin Agbabiaka, Principal at Octopus Ventures said: “We’ve been impressed by the power of Swiipr’s offering to fundamentally transform compensation payments, delivering the scale and efficiency of modern payments to the airline industry while significantly improving the travel experience for their customers. “Swiipr’s founders bring the depth of expertise in both the payments and travel industries necessary to tackle the airline compensation challenge. This complimentary skillset, and the effectiveness of its solution, have enabled Swiipr to already gain strong traction with major global carriers this early in its development.” Jens Schleuniger, Managing Partner at TX Ventures, “Customer satisfaction and retention has become a differentiating factor for every airline industry. An important aspect is clearly how to compensate frustrated customers in case of denied boarding and/or significant delays. Swiipr has developed a state-of-the-art payment solution that allows every airline to swiftly deal with compensation while offering significant benefits to both the passengers as well as the respective airlines. “Apart from the software solution itself we were particularly impressed by the two founders Tara and Ian as well as the traction that Swiipr has built. The team has been able to attract a number of tier 1 customers already and is clearly on the track to become a clear market leader in the passenger compensation category.”",

        "description": "Our experts have provided a number of tips to help you fix a wobbly ceiling fan",
        "content": "Ceiling fans are brilliant devices for circulating air around our homes, improving ventilation, and cooling us down when the summer heat gets too much. However, a wobbly ceiling fan is ineffective at . It is also annoying and dangerous if it falls from the ceiling. Thankfully, a shaky ceiling fan can be fixed to provide long-lasting, safe operation and effective air handling. While serious wobbles may require you to re-mount or even replace your fan, there are some tricks you can use to correct minor imbalances. A wobbly ceiling fan is a potential hazard you could do without. It usually indicates that the fan isn't securely attached or the blades are unbalanced. Here's a detailed guide on how to fix a wobbly ceiling fan: Before you start working on the fan, turn off the electricity to the ceiling fan by turning the circuit breaker at the electrical service panel. Then, cover the floor directly beneath the ceiling fan with a drop cloth or . Use a screwdriver to tighten all the screws that hold the fan blades in place, as well as the screws connecting the fan to the ceiling mount. Sometimes, tightening these can solve the problem. Try also tightening the blade arms. Blade arms are T-shaped metal elements that connect the fan blades to the ceiling fan. If any fan blades droop due to loose connections to the blade arms, use a screwdriver to tighten them. , HVAC technician and owner of Air Conditioner Lab, suggests that you also ensure that the mounting bracket/ceiling fan mount is securely attached to the ceiling joist. A loose mounting bracket could be the cause of your wobbly ceiling fan. If it's loose, tighten the screws or bolts securing it. If the bracket seems damaged, replace it. Over time, fan blades may warp or become damaged, affecting their balance and causing wobbling. Inspect the blades for any signs of warping, cracks, or damage, and replace any compromised blades to restore smooth operation. One blade's slight bend or distortion can throw the fan off balance. Replace any bent or deformed fan blade arms. Bent fan blade arms are difficult to bend back into form, so it is preferable to replace them. are often sold in bundles of five, so it is better to change them all at once. If the wobbling persists despite these efforts, it may be time to consider or replacing the ceiling fan altogether with a properly balanced one. Use a tape measure to ensure all blades are at the same distance from the ceiling. If any blade is out of alignment, you can gently bend the blade holder (not the blade itself) until it matches the others. If all blades appear intact, the next step is to balance them. According to , HVAC Master Instructor at The Refrigeration School, most fan kits include a balancing kit, which includes a clip and balancing weights, however if you do not have one you can buy a . ‘Attach the balancing clip to the middle of the leading edge of a blade. Next turn on the fan to see if the wobble improves,’ Guy explains. Move the clip around the blades to find where the wobble minimizes,’ Guy continues. ‘Once you see it, replace the clip with the adhesive balancing weights from the kit, placing them on top of the blade near the clip location.’ Inspect the downrod—the metal pipe connecting the fan to the ceiling. Ensure it's securely fastened and that the ball joint at the end of the downrod is snugly fit into the mount. A loose downrod can cause significant wobbling. Use a wrench to tighten the bolts if necessary. After adjusting, turn the power back on and test the fan. Watch for wobbles and listen for any unusual sounds. If the fan still wobbles, repeat the balancing process or check for loose components again. A ceiling fan could be making unnecessary noises for a number of reasons. In most cases, the noise will be caused by a loose blade, or a bent blade arm. Humming or buzzing noises may most likely be due to an issue with the motor or wiring, whereas a rubbing noise indicated two parts of the fan rubbing against one another. Generally, fixing a wobbly ceiling fan involves tightening all connections and balancing the blades. Regular maintenance checks can prevent wobbles from developing and ensure your fan operates smoothly and safely. You can also enhance the power of your . Suppose the problem persists despite all these steps. In that case, it might be best to consult a professional or consider replacing the fan if it's old or significantly damaged.",

The 31-year-old appeared at Inverness Sheriff Court to admit charges of assault and malicious damage in relation to the incident on December 11 2022. Fiscal depute Naomi Duffy-Welsh told the court that the victim and his girlfriend met Martin at the Blacksmiths Pub on Keppoch Road. After chatting to each other they realised that “they only lived a few doors away from each other”. Martin, who had been playing pool with a friend, invited the couple to come to his house, where the group drank more and smoked cannabis. Mr Duffy-Welsh said: “During this time the witness mentioned that he had just purchased a puggy machine, so the group left the accused house and walked round to the witness’ house.” By this time it was around 5am and the group sat in the living room, where Martin was playing on the slot machine when an argument began and “the accused punched the witness twice on the head”. Victim left ‘semi-conscious’ after assault The man was left bleeding heavily from the head and in a “semi-conscious state.” Martin’s friend restrained him but he escaped the man’s grip. “He ran back into the living room, picked up an empty glass beer bottle from the floor and began to threaten the witness with it, shouting words to the effect of: ‘If you grass I’ll kill you’.” Before leaving the house, Martin pushed over the slot machine, which smashed onto a tiled coffee table and television set, damaging all three “beyond repair”. He also smashed the oven door. The cost of the damage was estimated to be between £800 and £1,000. Victim suffered head injury and ambulance were called to the scene and the victim taken to Raigmore Hospital where he was found to have wounds to his head. The accused was traced and detained and also received medical treatment. Martin’s solicitor, Clare Russell, asked Sheriff Cruickshank to call for presentencing reports, which he did. Ordering a criminal justice social work report and a restriction of liberty assessment Sheriff Cruiskshank adjourned the case until next month, when the mitigation will be heard. Martin, of Galloway Drive, , was released on bail in the meantime.",

        "description": "Damage already done? US singer Doja Cat claims she was \"just kidding\" about comments made about her father, Dumisani Dlamini.",
        "content": "Doja Cat has seemingly backtracked on her comments insulting her father, Dumisani Dlamini. The US singer trended on social media on Monday, 27 May, after she launched a foul-mouth social media rant aimed at her South African dad. Doja was born in 1995 to the Durban actor and muso and his then-partner, Deborah Elizabeth Sawyer. Dumisani – known for his roles in Sarafina and Yizo Yizo – left the US to return home. Doja has yet to visit South Africa. It’s unclear if Doja has ever met Dumisani. DOJA CAT BACKTRACKS ON COMMENTS ABOUT DUMISANI DLAMINI In an Instagram post, Doja Cat put her father, Dumisani Dlamini, on blast yet again. In it, she called him out for “abandoning” his family and being a “b*tch.” One follower – likely a South African – was not impressed with Doja’s words, commenting: “You are messing with the wrong one. Zulus don’t play...your ancestors will humble you”. Doja Cat clapped back: “Go give the deadbeat a kiss on the lips for me.” She added: “[Dumisani] gave me a lazy eye and dipped.” However, before the day was up, Doja seemingly had a change of heart. The 28-year-old changed her caption to: “JK [Just Kidding] Love you, I was mad.” ‘THEY DON’T WANT ME TO CONTACT HER’ In a 2020 interview with Metro FM, Dumisani Dlamini claimed he had, in fact, attempted to reach out to Doja Cat. However, his efforts were allegedly halted by the singer’s management. “They don’t want me to connect with her. I have tried to send her messages on social media,” he said. “I’m looking forward to connecting with her because, as a Zulu girl, she needs to come and meet with her ancestors.” In 2021, Dumisani spoke to Mzansi Magic about his belief that Doja Cat would visit South Africa. Speaking of his Grammy-winning child, he said: “She’s my daughter. It just blew up now as if there was something wrong. People are changing stories.” He added, “We don’t want to dwell [on the past]. One day, she will come home, and everyone will see her.” Dumisani insisted he was proud of Doja “even before she became a superstar.” In a 2019 interview with Leah Henry and DJ Quicksilva, Doja Cat opened up about not knowing her father. She said: “I have never [met him], and he’s on Instagram. And he comments on my pictures sometimes. He’s an incredible dancer and great actor, but yeah, I don’t know him very well”.",

        "content": "PEMBELI 3 kilogram (kg) atau wajib menunjukkan KTP mulai 1 Juni 2024. Hal itu disampaikan oleh PT (Persero) melalui PT Pertamina Patra Niaga. Kebijakan itu diambil guna memastikan penyaluran tepat sasaran. “Kami laporkan bahwa per tanggal 1 Juni nantinya, pada saat akan melakukan pembelian LPG 3 kg, itu nanti akan dipersyaratkan untuk menggunakan KTP,” ujar Direktur Utama PT Pertamina Patra Niaga Riva Siahaan dalam Rapat Dengar Pendapat (RDP) dengan Komisi VII di Jakarta, Selasa, 28 Mei 2024. Riva mengatakan bahwa seluruh agen distribusi telah melakukan pendataan terhadap konsumen yang melakukan pembelian dan mencatat dalam aplikasi atau sebuah sistem yang disebut Merchant Application atau MAP. Sebanyak 253.365 pangkalan aktif menyalurkan LPG 3 kg pada April 2024. Dari keseluruhan pangkalan tersebut, sebesar 98,8% telah melakukan pencatatan minimal satu kali pada Maret 2024. “Update data ini adalah update data per 30 April 2024 dan ini masih bergerak di dalam penyelesaian untuk pencatatan setiap transaksinya,” kata Riva. Sebanyak 221.615 pangkalan atau 88% pangkalan, kata dia, telah melakukan pencatatan transaksi sebesar 100% realisasi penyaluran pada Maret 2024. “Secara juta tabung, itu sampai 30 April, 98% transaksi itu sudah dicatatkan ke dalam merchant application,” ucap dia. Dampak daripada pencatatan ini, lanjut Riva, sudah ada 41,8 juta NIK yang mendaftar di subsidi tepat LPG, di mana 85,9% pendaftarnya, atau sekitar 35,9 juta NIK berasal dari sektor rumah tangga. Lebih lanjut terdapat sektor usaha mikro sebanyak 5,8 juta NIK; diikuti pengecer sebanyak 70,3 ribu NIK; nelayan sasaran sebanyak 29,6 ribu NIK; dan petani sasaran sebanyak 12,8 ribu NIK. Riva menjelaskan bahwa jumlah konsumen rumah tangga dan usaha mikro yang melakukan transaksi masih terus bertambah selama periode Januari hingga April 2024. (Antara/Z-9)",

        "description": "The new upgraded planes will utilize the Garmin G5000 avionics suite.",
        "content": "On Monday, May 27, Textron Aviation announced several new avionics upgrades to the flagship private jet of its Cessna Citation family, the Citation Longitude, as well as one of the most popular midsize business jets, the Citation Latitude. Textron Aviation, which is the parent company of Cessna, announced these new upgrades to several of its business jets just days before the 2024 European Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition (EBACE) was set to kick off in Geneva, Switzerland. The avionics upgrades will allow both the Citation Latitude and the Citation Longitude, which are the two largest Citation jets that are currently produced, to be delivered with the newest Garmin avionics system, the Garmin G5000. The new avionics suite is set to join the Citation line within the next year. Textron Aviation will begin offering the Garmin G5000 avionics system in Citation Latitudes beginning in 2025. The company will begin delivering the Garmin G5000 avionics system in Citation Longitudes beginning in 2026. Lannie O'Bannion, the Senior Vice President of Global Sales and Flight Operations at Textron Aviation, spoke about the new avionics upgrades. O'Bannion stated, \"Citation jets offer customers performance, productivity, and profitability that opens a new world of possibility in aviation and their business. These enhancements demonstrate our commitment to continuously invest in our legendary products in order to design and deliver the best aviation experience for our customers.\" The Garmin G5000 is the latest and greatest avionics system in Garmin's extensive product line. Previously, both of these business jets, along with many other Citation jets, were delivered with the Garmin G3000 avionics system. However, the Garmin G5000 system provides several more benefits for Citation Latitude and Citation Longitude operators. One of the features expected to be included in the new avionics suite is the Synthetic Vision Guidance System (SVGS). This new system works with Synthetic Vision Technology (SVT) and depicts the upcoming landing. The SVGS shows on the primary flight display and begins displaying as low as 150 feet. It shows the topography of the surrounding area, the runway, and other obstacles to assist the crew with landing the aircraft. Upgrades to the SVT system are also coming with Garmin G5000. The SVT system will now utilize SafeTaxi to display the surrounding airport environment when the aircraft is taxiing. This system shows hangars, taxiways, other buildings, and even signs and displays to help the crew guide the aircraft while it is on the ground. Citation Latitudes and Latitudes will also come with the standard ADS-B In capability. This is available for Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI) Assisted Visual Separation (AVS). This helps pilots maintain clearance from other aircraft during the landing process and alerts the crew when attempting a landing or takeoff on a runway that is already occupied by an aircraft. The Garmin G5000 system will also utilize a GDL 60 Datalink. This allows for data exchange utilizing different connectivity options, including Bluetooth, WiFi, and LTE connections. Operators can automatically download various information utilizing network connections while the aircraft is not turned on. This offering is dependent on the region and surrounding area.",

        "content": "The large American flag is back on a residential fence along Dundee Road at Bach Street in Northbrook thanks to veterans of George W. Benjamin American Legion Post 791 of Northbrook. Post members installed an American flag on May 25 over Memorial Day weekend after the flag, a regular presence on the fence since the evening of Sept. 11, 2001, went missing on May 2. The owners of the flag, Beth Koeppen and Larry Rosenthal, reported the flag as stolen to Northbrook police for documentation reasons. Giving a thumbs up to a motorist honking in approval is Eleanor Nalven of Northbrook, who lives with her daughter Beth Koeppen and Beth’s partner Larry Rosenthal on Bach Street in Northbrook where the new flag is installed at Dundee Road and Bach Street on May 25, 2024 in Northbrook. (Karie Angell Luc/Pioneer Press) A shocked Koeppen then said, “It’s the flag of our country ... all people’s flag. “It’s about America.” When post members learned the flag went missing, they immediately offered to replace it. On a sunny Saturday, veterans installed a brand new flag as shadows became long soon before sunset. Several motorists honked with approval as the small group gathered on a Dundee Road sidewalk for the flag installation. Friends and family attended with support, helping hands, and thumbs up. From left to right, all of Northbrook, Tom Kittler, Eleanor Nalven, Beth Koeppen, Larry Rosenthal and Rob Holt after the installation of the American flag on a residential fence at Dundee Road and Bach Street on May 25, 2024 in Northbrook. (Karie Angell Luc/Pioneer Press) “I’m just so pleased that we can do this for our neighbors, that’s what we do,” said Tom Kittler of Northbrook, post commander and a retired brigadier general who served in the U.S. Air Force for 32 years, both active and reserve, and was in the reserves on 9/11/2001. Kittler, also a retired American Airlines pilot, is of the Glenbrook North High School Class of 1979. Koeppen and Rosenthal planned to replace the stolen American flag and were stunned to learn of the post’s offer. “It seemed like the right thing to do and I certainly hope it remains in place,” Kittler said. “Especially around Memorial Day, that’s an important time for our country and for us to remember those that have fallen.” Talking on their driveway about 5 p.m., where the group gathered shortly before installation, were 801 Bach Street residents Koeppen, Rosenthal, and Koeppen’s mother Eleanor Nalven. On far left is Richard J. Kennedy of Wheeling. Center, handling the new American flag is Rob Holt of Northbrook, twice past commander of the George W. Benjamin American Legion Post 791 of Northbrook, who is installing the flag at Dundee Road and Bach Street on May 25, 2024, in Northbrook. (Karie Angell Luc/Pioneer Press) “I’m still kind of upset that somebody took this and I wish I knew why,” Rosenthal said of the missing flag. “I have a feeling I know why but I hope maybe it was not what I think. With what’s going on in this world, it seems like it’s something else.” The Northbrook Veterans Center at 1354 Shermer Road is the storefront home of Post 791, the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 10236, the American Legion Auxiliary, Sons of the American Legion, and the American Legion Riders. To Post 791 members, “I can’t even believe they’re doing this,” Rosenthal added. “For them to feel and realize that this is an issue they need to address is wonderful. It’s so beautiful. “I think we need as a country to get back together and stick together and be harmonious,” Rosenthal said. “We’re America. Let’s not be divided anymore, let’s be together.” With the Memorial Day weekend timing, “You have to remember the dead that sacrificed their lives for our country and to keep us free and to be able to speak what we want,” Koeppen said. Koeppen’s mother Eleanor said, “I’m proud, I love the flag, proud to be an American.” For years, motorists have noticed the American flag as a patriotic gesture installed by the Koeppen family on Dundee Road wood fencing at Bach Street. Koeppen and her then spouse, the late John Koeppen, took their American flag off a pole by the home’s front door on 9/11/2001, placing the flag on the exterior fence side for all people. A cicada is in on top of one of the small flags on the right. Right, Beth Koeppen of Northbrook is pleased a new American flag has been installed to replace a missing flag on a residential fence at Dundee Road and Bach Street on May 25, 2024 in Northbrook. (Karie Angell Luc/Pioneer Press) Beth Koeppen and Rosenthal continued the tradition, respectfully replacing flags as fabric faded or worn. The couple added American flag lighting next to the material version. To fill the void, Koeppen placed small American flags at the base of the fence where a large unfaded wood spot indicated where the missing flag was. On May 25, she removed them when the new flag was in place, noticing cicadas perched on the smaller flags as unexpected visitors to the community moment. Rob Holt of Northbrook, twice past commander of the Northbrook post, used a staple gun to apply maybe 40 extra deep staples on the wood. The American manufactured flag is, “polyester, which is really the most durable flag to have,” Holt said proudly. “It’s absolutely stunning and beautiful, it’s so honest and true and pure, I love it. “It’s America, it’s Memorial Day,” Holt said, adding many, “died for that to give us the opportunity to put that flag up and to live free. That’s what America is. “When I heard it was that flag (Dundee Road flag), and I’ve driven past that flag for 1,000 times, and one day it wasn’t there, and I wondered why, and when I heard about why, I said, ‘Absolutely, we got to hop all over this one.’ “It’s what the post does,” added Holt, who served in the United States Navy from 1971 to 1976. “It’s something we had to do. “We take care of each other, we take care of veterans and we hope to take care of the town.” As with many Americans, Koeppen, Rosenthal, and Kittler recall where they were on the morning of 9/11/2001. Koeppen was in Northbrook when her mother called to tell her to turn on the television, Rosenthal was on the East Coast and Kittler was in the Glenview vicinity.

Kennedy of Wheeling, Eleanor Nalven of Northbrook, Beth Koeppen of Northbrook, Larry Rosenthal of Northbrook and Rob Holt of Northbrook after the installation of the American flag on a residential fence at Dundee Road and Bach Street on May 25, 2024 in Northbrook. (Karie Angell Luc/Pioneer Press) On 9/11/2001, Holt was in Humboldt Park when he and a colleague saw on television, “the other plane hitting the other building (Twin Towers).” “This is America,” Holt said. “Stuff like that doesn’t happen in America.” Holt is inspired by the Dundee Road flag and the neighbors behind it since 9/11/2001. “I wish everybody had that honor and dignity,” Holt said. “If we all had that honor and dignity,” Holt said, “...we wouldn’t have the problems that we have. We would honor something noble and good and honest and we would act that way.” Karie Angell Luc is a freelancer for Pioneer Press.",

        "description": "Canadian authorities have approved the couple’s refugee application, citing their “fear of persecution” and other reasons.",
        "content": "“I hope this helps more and more people understand the reality that women and LGBTQ people face in Japan,” Akira Nishiyama, deputy secretary general of the Japan Alliance for LGBT Legislation (J-ALL), told This Week in Asia. “The reality is prejudice, discrimination and no legal protections.” The Asahi newspaper on May 18 quoted government officials in Ottawa as saying they had approved the couple’s refugee applications partly due to same-sex couples not being permitted to legally marry in Japan, not entitled to the same benefits as heterosexual couples and having a “fear of persecution” due to their sexuality. Nishiyama, herself a lesbian, said she was aware of the problems the couple faced, which included real estate agents refusing to show LGBTQ people rental properties because “few houses are available for same-sex couples to rent.” “Their case has made me keenly aware that Japan is a long way behind in terms of human rights protection and the struggles they have faced are those that many LGBTQ people face here every day,” she said. “But that should not be our daily reality.” In its 2019 report , the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ranked Japan 34 out of 35 countries for legal LGBTQ inclusivity. “It seems like Japan is pedalling a bicycle when other countries are riding sports cars when it comes to trying to promote gender equality,” Nishiyama told This Week in Asia. J-ALL is campaigning for changes to existing legislation that would guarantee the legal rights of sexual minorities, including a law that would ban discrimination on the grounds of a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity and marriage equality. A law to promote “understanding of diversity” passed by Tokyo in June 2023 was a positive first step but it had no legal teeth to deal with discrimination cases, Nishiyama said. Marriage laws mean that same-sex couples are not allowed to inherit their partners’ properties when they die and can be denied access when their partners are in hospital as they are not legally “family”. Discrimination has consequences with transgender individuals 10 times more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual people and significantly more likely to be living in poverty, according to J-ALL. The challenges could be even harder for lesbians, according to Nishiyama, as they also face discrimination as women, who typically earn less than men and have fewer opportunities for career advancement. “I am angry and disappointed that our rights are still neglected in Japan,” she said. “Being a lesbian is no reason for shame and we are the same as heterosexual people. But many of us are still in the closet, many choose never to come out before they die. That is heart-breaking.” Alexander Dmitrenko, a partner in the Tokyo office of the Ashurst multinational law firm and co-chair of LLAN, the Lawyers for LGBT & Allies Network NPO, said the failure of successive governments to pass meaningful equality legislation was shocking given that most Japanese were in favour of same-sex marriages being recognised. About 64 per cent of people in Japan supported marriage rights for same-sex couples, a poll by Kyodo News published in February 2023 showed. The poll was conducted a week after a close aide to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida was fired for saying he would not want to live next to a gay couple and that people would leave Japan if same-sex marriages were legally recognised. “The Japanese government should be embarrassed” about the lesbian couple receiving their refugee status in Canada, Dmitrenko said. “It is all the more astonishing as Japan is not known as a place for gay-bashing or persecution.” 02:33 Thailand’s lower house of parliament approves bill recognising same-sex marriage Japan was reputed to be “tolerant, respectful and accommodating” of other people, said Dmitrenko, who expressed hope that the case of the lesbian couple would encourage Japanese politicians to change their stance on LGBTQ matters. Hailing the couple’s bravery, Nishiyama said: “I always wanted to go abroad when I was young because I wanted to escape from Japanese society, where LGBTQ people are not considered to be the same as others. When I was a teenager, I had never met other LGBTQ people and I had no role models.” Nishiyama said she could not come out as a lesbian in her younger days because she was scared of rejection. She later made the “right decision” to study in California when she was 20. “No one judged me when I came out [in California] and I gained confidence. So I totally understand why the lesbian couple in this case decided to move to Canada. When LGBTQ rights are protected and society welcomes diversity, we can feel safe and live freely.” This Week in Asia has contacted the Cabinet Office’s Gender Equality Bureau for a comment.",

        "content": "Vastint UK, the developer behind Aire Park has applied for a massive refurbishment and restoration of the 92-year-old building. As part of its proposal, the developer said it wants to retain the landmark’s art deco facade, open op new areas of the building to the public for the first time and increase accessibility so that the former brewery can be enjoyed by all.

Plans reveal that the basement, which previously connected the building with the wider brewery site, will be used as a speakeasy lounge and bar, whilst the ground floor will host a market hall space with amenities including Changing Places facilities. The plans also reveals the future of The Tetley ’s long-standing connection with both culture and commerce on the upper floors, where an event space and 13,000 sq ft of office space are planned. Simon Schofield, Head of Development North at Vastint UK, said: “ The Tetley is an iconic building within Leeds , and we’re privileged to have it as a cornerstone of the Aire Park development. “As custodians of this important piece of the city’s history , we have been working hard with our architects Supervene and Enjoy Design, Leeds City Council and others to look at how we preserve this beautiful building, ensuring it remains at the heart of the community for another century. Advertisement Advertisement “Our plans aim to create a variety of spaces within the building including public amenities such as a Changing Places facility, food and drink opportunities and event spaces, which will be accessible to all. We also want to continue the building’s history of being a place of business , by creating new office space. “Ultimately this project is unique in its scope, as it not only adds to the wider development but also ensures a major landmark continues to play an active role in the future of Leeds. We’d like to think that Joshua Tetley would be impressed by the ambition we have for the site he purchased for £402 in 1822 and grew to be the largest brewery in the North of England.” Vastint UK acquired the Tetley building from Carlsberg in 2022 has since been working on its plans to make it the crown jewel in their new Aire Park development , Leeds’ newest mixed-use district , which includes a new 3.5-hectare city centre green park, up to 1,400 news homes and 800,000 sq ft of office space. The developer recently partnered with Kirkstall Brewery to reopen the building to the public whilst planning approval is sought from the council.

The building has evolved constantly over its almost one-hundred-year history and we’re very proud to be a part of the next evolution of Leeds’ beloved Tetley.” Michael Westlake, director at Supervene Architects added: “To be given the chance to work on a building which holds such an important place within a city’s cultural history and be able to shape its next chapter is really exciting. “We believe these plans will not only breathe new life into the building and open aspects which have never been open to the public before, but will also ensure the building can continue to act as a beacon to attract both locals and visitors to the area and the wider Aire Park.” The application is due for consultation on Friday, June 7, with comments to be submitted by Friday, June 28.",

The children took part in 10 events with lots of heats ranging from 9m assisted float to 25m and 50m breaststroke, freestyle and butterfly. Pembrokeshire schools through to Stamford Bridge semi finals Free disability sports event heads to Pembroke Leisure Centre Tenby Sailing Club: Competitive dinghy racing in ideal conditions Pembroke Under 12s lose out in regional age group finals The swimmers’ times were all recorded and it is hoped that some participants will be identified to sign up for the Swim Wales Para Talent ID programme.

The Volunteers haven’t lost consecutive games since mid-March and are the only team in the country to win 50 games three of the past four years.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Chris Kavanagh scored five goals, his brother Pat had six assists and top-seeded Notre Dame captured its second straight NCAA men’s lacrosse championship, defeating Maryland 15-5 on Monday. Notre Dame (16-1), which won its second title in program history, became the first program to win back-to-back championships in consecutive seasons since Duke repeated in 2014. Only nine teams in history have accomplished the feat. Virginia won in 2019 and again in 2021 after the 2020 season was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Maryland (11-6) was playing in the championship game for the 17th time in program history, trailing only Johns Hopkins with 18. The Irish scored the first five goals of the second quarter to go up 10-3. COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) — D’Auna Jennings led off the top of the ninth inning with a home run to end a scoreless pitching duel between Cassidy Curd and Missouri’s Laurin Krings and 10th-seeded Duke held on for a wild 4-3 victory over the seventh-seeded Tigers on Sunday in the finale of the best-of-three Columbia Super Regional, sending the Blue Devils to the Women’s College World Series for the first time. Jennings provided the spark Duke (52-7) needed when she sent a 1-2 pitch from Krings over the wall in right field for her ninth home run of the season. Missouri (48-18) had the tying run on before falling short. CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Ben Miller and Devin Obee hit grand slams and Miller added a two-run shot as No. 6 seed Duke rolled to a 16-4 victory over fifth-seeded Florida State in the championship game of the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament, earning the Blue Devils a regional berth. Miller homered with the bases loaded in the top of the fourth inning to put Duke (39-18) on top 9-2 and Obee’s blast increased the Blue Devils’ advantage to 14-4, capping a five-run sixth. Florida State (42-15) grabbed a 2-0 lead two batters into the game following a Max Williams single and a Cam Smith home run off Duke starter James Tallon. INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — The Atlantic Coast Conference and Southeastern Conference each had five schools selected as regional host sites for the NCAA Division I baseball tournament. All 16 regional hosts have locked up spots in the national tournament. The rest of the 64-team field will be unveiled Monday. Clemson, Florida State, North Carolina State, North Carolina and Virginia led the way for the ACC. Tennessee, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky and Texas A&M were selected from the SEC.

Lane Forsythe went 3-for-5 for the second-seeded Cowboys, drove in a run and scored twice in a contest Oklahoma State never trailed. Zach Ehrhard hit a sacrifice fly to center field that scored Carson Benge and staked Oklahoma State to a 1-0 lead. In the fifth, Avery Ortiz pushed the Cowboys’ lead to 2-0 with a sacrifice fly to center field that scored Ian Daugherty. Forsythe made it 3-0 with a single that drove in Colin Brueggemann.

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Viviana Martinez had three hits and drove in two runs to lead No. 1 seeded Texas into the WCWS with a 6-5 win over 16th-seeded Texas A&M in the Austin Super Regional. Martinez had an RBI double in the bottom of the third when the Longhorns took a 2-0 lead. She also had a double in the fifth and capped a three-run sixth inning with an RBI triple, which proved to be the difference. Texas is headed to its seventh WCWS. It didn’t come easily as Julia Cottrill followed a single and a walk in the top of the seventh with a three-run home run for the Aggies.Mac Morgan (15-1) allowed four hits and two unearned runs in 5 1/3 innings for the Longhorns and Teagan Kavan went the rest of the way for her fourth save.

(AP) — Tallen Edwards went deep in the first inning for the first of Oklahoma State’s three home runs and the Cowgirls defeated Arizona 10-4 to sweep the Stillwater Super Regional. The Cowgirls scored three runs in the top of the first inning and the only thing that really slowed them down was a long weather delay while they were batting in the fifth inning. Jilyen Poullard drew a walk to open the game and Edwards followed with a home run to left center. OSU added another run on consecutive wild pitches with Claire Timm batting. She was hit by a pitch later in the at-bat. Rosie Davis and Timm hit back-to-back home runs in the third and Timm added an RBI double in the fifth before the delay. Oklahoma State advances to the Women's College World Series beginning Thursday. UNDATED (AP) — Texas beat No. 16 seed Texas A&M 6-5 to win the Austin Super Regional and advance to the Women's College World Series.

The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. STANFORD, Calif. (AP) — Kaitlyn Lim’s walkoff home run leading off the sixth inning after Stanford scored seven in the fifth sent the Cardinal to the WCWS with an 8-0 win over LSU in the Stanford Super Regional. The teams were locked in a tense pitching dual heading into the fifth inning. River Mahler tripled to open the bottom of the fifth for Stanford and scored on a fielder’s choice. Ava Gall, Aly Kaneshiro and Caelan Koch had run-scoring singles. When Raelin Chaffin relieved Sydney Berzon (20-9) for LSU, Jade Berry drove her first pitch over the center field fence for a three-run home run. NiJaree Canady gave up three hits for her second-straight shutout. She had a two-hit shutout on Saturday after LSU won the first game 11-1 on Friday. SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Tommy Splaine lined a run-scoring single in the bottom of the ninth inning and Arizona rallied from a three-run deficit to beat Southern California 4-3 in the Pac-12 baseball tournament championship game. The championship game was the final Pac-12 game for the conference as we know it, with 10 teams heading to new conferences next fall. Arizona appeared to be headed to a second straight Pac-12 title game disappointment, managing one baserunner through the first six innings against USC starter Caden Aoki. The Wildcats scored a run off Aoki in the seventh inning, two more in the eighth and walked it off on Splaine's hit. INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — The Atlantic Coast Conference and Southeastern Conference each had five schools selected as regional host sites for the NCAA Division I baseball tournament. All 16 regional hosts have locked up spots in the national tournament. The rest of the 64-team field will be unveiled Monday. Clemson, Florida State, North Carolina State, North Carolina and Virginia led the way for the ACC. Tennessee, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky and Texas A&M were selected from the SEC. Also hosting regionals are Oklahoma and Oklahoma State from the Big 12; Arizona and Oregon State from the Pac-12; East Carolina from the American Athletic Conference; and UC Santa Barbara from the Big West. UNDATED (AP) — Texas beat No. 16 seed Texas A&M 6-5 to win the Austin Super Regional and advance to the Women's College World Series. The top-seeded Longhorns lost the opener Friday, then kept their season alive by rallying to beat the Aggies in extra innings Saturday. Florida, Duke, Alabama and Stanford won other decisive Game 3s. In World Series matchups Thursday, three-time defending champion Oklahoma will face Duke, Texas will play Stanford, Alabama will face UCLA, and Florida will play Oklahoma State.",

        "description": "Global sports travel is a luxury far too expensive for most Indians. But those who can afford it are spending big sums to watch sporting extravaganzas such as the India-Pakistan cricket match in New York, Wimbledon, Formula One races, and the Paris Olympics",
        "content": ": Mohit Gupta, a wealthy individual in his mid-40s in Gurugram, is packing his bags to go watch the India-Pakistan cricket match in New York city. Never before has any international-level cricket tournament been played on American soil, home to a vast diaspora from the two Asian neighbours. Fanatic Sports Pvt. Ltd, a Mumbai-based sports hospitality company, has curated a pretty package for Gupta that includes a three-night stay at a Taj Hotels 5-star property, the match ticket, visit to a practice game, a tour with select cricketers, and meals with retired players—all for $4,000, or about 3.3 lakh. The India-Pakistan clash on 9 June at the upcoming ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup in New York is the most-anticipated match Indians are looking forward to, as with any meeting involving the two teams. India will also be battling Ireland, the US, and Canada, none of which are teams of much reckoning. Fanatic Sports is among official sellers of tickets for the World Cup matches. DreamSetGo, another Mumbai-based sports travel company and an official partner for the International Cricket Council (ICC) T20 World Cup, has sold out its packages for the India-Pakistan clash. The company didn’t disclose the number of packages sold. Apart from the match ticket, DreamSetGo’s exclusive package includes a meet-and-greet with former India captain Sourav Ganguly, stay in a 5-star hotel for four days, private luxury transfers, and a meal at a Michelin-star restaurant. The tag: 2-15 lakh per person. To be sure, at those prices, global sports travel is still a luxury in India that few can afford. “We mainly target HNIs (high-networth individuals) and corporate travellers. From the corporate standpoint, the average package ranges from 2-2.5 lakh, unless they plan to take their top personnel like CXOs and opt for top hospitality. That ranges between 10-15 lakhs per person,\" said DreamSetGo’s founder Monish Shah. “For HNIs, the average package ranges from 4-5 lakh per person.\" DreamSetGo is also a travel partner for the 2024 Paris Olympics, which begins on 26 July. The big brag theory Indians aren’t just crazy about cricket. The uber-rich are also keen on tennis Grand Slams and Formula One races wherever they are held. “This year, we have noticed a 36% increase in interest for big-ticket global sporting events,\" said Rajeev Kale, president and country head for holidays, MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions tourism), and visa, at Thomas Cook (India) Ltd. “Topping the list are international cricket matches, the Wimbledon in June, the Olympics in July, and F1 at Bahrain, Singapore, Yas Island, etc.\" For the India-Pakistan match in New York, the travel agency has received about 200 so far, including from groups of people, Kale said, adding that about one-fourth of its consumers have global sporting events in mind when selecting their travel destinations. “There are undeniable brag-able rights when people attend such premium sporting engagements.\" Thomas Cook’s sports-based packages typically include meet-and-greets and dining with sports stars and autographed merchandise. One of its packages for the Olympics is priced upwards of 11 lakh per person for a group of about 50 customers. Sports travel: still warming up Sports tourism is still a nascent concept for Indians, even as they are increasingly shedding the traditional aversion to spending big money on global travel (which can turn out to be quite expensive as the rupee continues depreciating against the dollar). According to US-based research firm Grand View, the global sports tourism industry registered about $587.87 billion in revenue in 2022, the latest year for which data was available. But India doesn’t feature on the firm’s list, possibly because the country accounts for a mere fraction of the industry. Indian appetite for sports travel, though, is evidently increasing, even if for domestic events to begin with. Amsterdam-based travel major Booking.com observed that about 76% of Indian respondents in a recent survey said they were willing to travel for sports events such as the Indian Premier League (cricket), Pro Kabaddi, and the Indian Super League (football) within their city or state. That said, there is also a spike in searches on Booking.com for Paris, London and New York ahead of major sporting events, said Santosh Kumar, the company’s country manager for India. “With the Wimbledon Championship scheduled for July, London is on top of the list for Indians travelling globally this July, with a 10% increase in searches as compared to last year,\" Kumar said. “New York is among the top 10 most-searched destinations by Indians this June, witnessing a 50% increase in searches between June 1 and June 15, in line with the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024.\" Paris, the main host of this year’s Olympics, has seen a 30% year-on-year increase in searches on Booking.com as compared with the same period last year, Kumar said, adding that Indians are also looking up nearby destinations in France, such as Nice, Cannes, and Cap D'Agde. An emerging sector Several Indians keen on the India-Pakistan match are opting to buy tickets directly from the ICC’s website, which costs upwards of $300, or about 25,000, a fraction of what they would be paying for an all-inclusive premium package. Still, Raghav Gupta, founder of Fanatic Sport, insists there is sufficient demand for the company’s packages tailored for the India-Pakistan cricket match in New York. “We hope that as many as 800 people will travel with us for the World Cup alone, and another 1,500 overall out of India for tournaments such as the ongoing Roland-Garros, the upcoming Wimbledon, the Euro 2024, and the Paris Olympics,\" Gupta said. Fanatic Sports's revenue in 2022-23 more than doubled to 40 crore from FY22's 18.92 crore, show regulatory filings accessed via business intelligence platform Tofler. But Fanatic swung to a net loss of 6.75 crore in FY23 from a net profit of 7.1 lakh in the year before. DreamSetGo also recorded a net loss in 2022-23, of 26.15 crore, widening from a loss of 85,500 in the financial year prior, as per the company’s filings accessed via Tofler. Shah, DreamSetGo’s founder, however, is optimistic that the sports travel industry is taking off among Indians. Although DreamSetGo is yet to officially file its earnings for 2023-24, Shah expects the company’s revenue to have doubled during the year, after growing at 30% in 2022-23.",

        "content": "KEPUTUSAN terbaru , Irlandia, dan Norwegia atas telah memicu reaksi keras dari , yang dengan cepat merespons dengan menarik duta besarnya dari Madrid, Dublin, dan Oslo. Langkah ini menandai eskalasi signifikan dalam ketegangan antara Israel dan ketiga negara Eropa tersebut. Dalam serangkaian tweet yang tajam, Menteri Luar Negeri Israel Israel Katz, secara khusus mengecam Spanyol. Katz menuduh Spanyol menyerah kepada Hamas, organisasi yang oleh Israel dan banyak negara lainnya dianggap sebagai kelompok teroris. Tuduhan ini mengindikasikan pandangan Israel bahwa pengakuan terhadap negara Palestina akan memperkuat posisi Hamas dalam konflik yang sedang berlangsung. Pada Minggu (25/5), Katz memposting sebuah video di platform media sosial X yang menampilkan penari flamenco, sebuah simbol budaya Spanyol yang dikenal luas. Video tersebut disertai dengan pesan yang berbunyi, “Pedro Sánchez, Hamas berterima kasih atas layananmu,” merujuk kepada Perdana Menteri Spanyol. Pesan ini jelas dimaksudkan untuk mengejek keputusan pemerintah Spanyol dan mengkritik kebijakan luar negerinya. Langkah Spanyol, Irlandia, dan Norwegia untuk mengakui negara Palestina ini sejalan dengan dukungan mereka terhadap solusi dua negara dalam konflik Israel-Palestina. Namun, keputusan ini bertentangan dengan posisi Israel yang menganggap pengakuan sepihak terhadap negara Palestina sebagai tindakan yang merugikan proses perdamaian dan mengabaikan negosiasi langsung antara kedua belah pihak. Reaksi keras dari Israel ini menunjukkan betapa sensitifnya isu pengakuan negara Palestina dalam konteks diplomasi internasional. Ketegangan yang meningkat ini kemungkinan akan mempengaruhi hubungan bilateral antara Israel dan ketiga negara Eropa tersebut, serta mempengaruhi dinamika politik di kawasan Timur Tengah secara keseluruhan.

        "content": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Chris Kavanagh scored five goals, his brother Pat had six assists and top-seeded Notre Dame captured its second straight NCAA men’s lacrosse championship, defeating Maryland 15-5 on Monday. Notre Dame (16-1), which won its second title in program history, became the first program to win back-to-back championships in consecutive seasons since Duke repeated in 2014. Only nine teams in history have accomplished the feat. Virginia won in 2019 and again in 2021 after the 2020 season was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Maryland (11-6) was playing in the championship game for the 17th time in program history, trailing only Johns Hopkins with 18. The Irish scored the first five goals of the second quarter to go up 10-3. INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — The Atlantic Coast Conference and Southeastern Conference each had five schools selected as regional host sites for the NCAA Division I baseball tournament.

OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Nebraska’s Gabe Swanson drove in pinch-runner Cayden Brumbaugh with a two-out double in the top of the ninth inning and Big Ten pitcher of the year Brett Sears retired the heart of the Penn State order to seal a 2-1 victory, earning the Cornhuskers the conference tournament title and a regional berth. Second-seeded Nebraska (39-20), which joined the Big Ten in 2011, also won the tournament in 2017 and 2021. The Cornhuskers have never won the College World Series, previously appearing in 2001, 2002 and 2005. Penn State (29-24), which played as an independent until joining the conference in 1993, has made five CWS appearances but none since 1973. The Nittany Lions were the runners-up in 1957.

The 64-team event opens with 16 regionals Friday. Winners advance to eight best-of-three super regionals. Those winners move to the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska, beginning June 14. The Volunteers haven’t lost consecutive games since mid-March and are the only team in the country to win 50 games three of the past four years. They will try to become the first No. 1 national seed to win the title since Miami in 1999, the year the NCAA went to the current tournament structure. STANFORD, Calif. (AP) — Kaitlyn Lim’s walkoff home run leading off the sixth inning after Stanford scored seven in the fifth sent the Cardinal to the WCWS with an 8-0 win over LSU in the Stanford Super Regional. The teams were locked in a tense pitching dual heading into the fifth inning. River Mahler tripled to open the bottom of the fifth for Stanford and scored on a fielder’s choice. Ava Gall, Aly Kaneshiro and Caelan Koch had run-scoring singles.

NiJaree Canady gave up three hits for her second-straight shutout. She had a two-hit shutout on Saturday after LSU won the first game 11-1 on Friday. AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Viviana Martinez had three hits and drove in two runs to lead No. 1 seeded Texas into the WCWS with a 6-5 win over 16th-seeded Texas A&M in the Austin Super Regional. Martinez had an RBI double in the bottom of the third when the Longhorns took a 2-0 lead. She also had a double in the fifth and capped a three-run sixth inning with an RBI triple, which proved to be the difference. Texas is headed to its seventh WCWS. It didn’t come easily as Julia Cottrill followed a single and a walk in the top of the seventh with a three-run home run for the Aggies.Mac Morgan (15-1) allowed four hits and two unearned runs in 5 1/3 innings for the Longhorns and Teagan Kavan went the rest of the way for her fourth save. KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Riley Valentine hit a first-inning grand slam, Jocelyn Briski took a two-hitter into the seventh inning and 14th-seeded Alabama upended No. 3 seed Tennessee in the Knoxville Super Regional, earning the Crimson Tide a spot in the Women’s College World Series. Volunteers starter Payton Gottshall (20-5) struck out the first two batters she faced before Kenleigh Cahalan singled to left. Gottshall hit Jenna Johnson and Marlie Giles on back-to-back pitches to load the bases. Valentine sent a 1-0 pitch over the fence in left field for a 4-0 lead. It was only the fourth home run for the .216 hitter who had 15 RBIs in 41 games. That was plenty for Briski (10-5), a freshman, who allowed a double, a single and a walk with four strikeouts through six innings. COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) — D’Auna Jennings led off the top of the ninth inning with a home run to end a scoreless pitching duel between Cassidy Curd and Missouri’s Laurin Krings and 10th-seeded Duke held on for a wild 4-3 victory over the seventh-seeded Tigers on Sunday in the finale of the best-of-three Columbia Super Regional, sending the Blue Devils to the Women’s College World Series for the first time. Jennings provided the spark Duke (52-7) needed when she sent a 1-2 pitch from Krings over the wall in right field for her ninth home run of the season. Missouri (48-18) had the tying run on before falling short. HOOVER, Ala. (AP) — Billy Amick hit a three-run home run, catcher Cal Stark picked off a runner at third with the bases loaded to end the sixth inning and Aaron Combs struck out the final two batters with the tying run on second to help preserve top-seeded Tennessee’s 4-3 victory over defending champion LSU in the championship game of the Southeastern Conference Tournament. Tennessee (49-11), the regular-season SEC champions, notched their fifth conference championship since the tournament began in 1977, most recently winning it in 2022 and including three straight from 1993-95. LSU (40-21), the 11th seed this season, has won a record 12 tourney titles, most recently in 2017 and including three in a row from 2008-10.

Florida (51-13) won its fifth straight Game 3 in the super regionals, also doing so from 2017-19 and most recently in 2022.

        "description": "There are risks one has to be aware of before an investing decision is taken.",
        "content": "The normal mode of investing in passive funds is to select one that tracks a particular index and the weights of the holdings in the portfolio will match the weights of the stocks in the index. This will lead to a mirror image of the performance of the index being tracked. The overall returns of the index depend to a large extent on the performance of the index heavy components. This might not reflect the true picture and hence one of the alternatives suggested in such a situation is to look at equal weighted investing. There are risks in this field too and one has to be aware of these before an investing decision is taken. Equal weight investing, as the name suggests, ensures that there is equal weightage given to all the holdings that are present in the portfolio. For example, if there are 50 stocks in an index, then under the normal index investing the weights will be dependent on the weight of the stock in the index and this will vary. However, in equal weight investing all the 50 stocks will have the same weightage of 2% each and hence, a movement in any of the companies will have a similar impact in terms of the movement of the index. Equal weight investing tries to ensure that the changes in a lot of the holdings are not ignored and that the investor is able to gain from the situation. Equal weight investing is easy to understand because the investor on their own is likely to have started off by investing an equal amount in several of their holdings. One of the best ways to follow this investing style is to select a mutual fund that manages its funds in this particular manner. There are a lot of passive funds that follow the equal weight investing style and hence, the investor can access this at a low cost, without much of a problem. Such equal weight funds are normally based on a leading index like the Nifty 50. The normal approach of investors is that they think of the upside when they make an investment decision in terms of the potential gains. A similar thing happens with equal weight investing too, as the investor thinks about the fact that in a bull run a larger number of companies are rising. This broad based rally might not be translated into gains on an index because many of these companies have a lower weightage and hence the impact is lesser. In such a situation, the equal weight index will outperform the normal index. But the reverse can also turn out to be the case, as if there is a fall in the market and there is widespread selling. Here, the investor will find that the equal weight index is falling more because a large number of companies within it that are getting impacted. This is one factor that should not be ignored because the investor is likely to end up with bigger losses than the overall market and it could wipe out a large part of the earlier gains. The other factor that will impact the result is the time period when the rebalancing takes place. This is important because once the equal weights have been set up, there will be changes depending on the movement of the prices of the companies. In such a situation, there has to be a rebalancing after a certain point of time to ensure that the weights remain equal over the longer run. If this is done quarterly, then it is a reasonable time when the reset would be done but longer time periods can dilute the impact of the whole concept. This becomes another aspect of the risk control that will ensure that the concept works as it is intended to. Arnav Pandya is founder Moneyeduschool",

        "description": "Tanks reach Rafah’s centre as Israel presses assaultIsraeli tanks have advanced into Rafah amid ongoing conflict, with international outcry and humanitarian concerns, prompting recognition of Palestine by Spain, Ireland, and Norway.The post Tanks reach Rafah’s centre as Israel presses assault first appeared on The Dispatch.",
        "content": "Israeli tanks reached the centre of Rafah for the first time on Tuesday, witnesses said, three weeks into a ground operation in the southern Gaza city that has sparked global condemnation. The tanks were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a central Rafah landmark, the witnesses told Reuters. The Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in the Rafah area without commenting on reported advancements into the city centre. Overnight, its forces pounded the city with airstrikes and tank fire, residents said, pressing its offensive despite an international outcry over an attack on Sunday that sparked a blaze in a tent camp, killing at least 45 Palestinians, more than half of them children, women and the elderly. Since that strike, at least 26 more people have been killed by Israeli fire in Rafah, officials in the enclave run by Hamas militants said. Israeli tanks pushed towards western neighbourhoods and took positions on the Zurub hilltop in western Rafah in one of the worst nights of bombardment reported by residents. On Tuesday, witnesses reported gunbattles between Israeli troops and Hamas-led fighters in the Zurub area. Witnesses in Rafah said the Israeli military appeared to have brought in remote-operated armoured vehicles and there was no immediate sign of personnel in or around them. An Israeli military spokesperson had no immediate response. Since Israel launched its incursion by taking control of the border crossing with Egypt three weeks ago, tanks had probed around the edges of Rafah and entered some of its eastern districts but had not yet entered the city in full force. Reacting to Sunday night’s attack in a camp where families displaced from assaults elsewhere in Gaza had sought shelter, global leaders urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel’s assault. Residents said the Tel Al-Sultan area, the scene of Sunday’s deadly strike, was still being heavily bombarded. “Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,” one resident told Reuters over a chat app. Around one million people have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday. Israel has kept up attacks despite a ruling by the top U.N. court on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing that the court’s ruling grants it some scope for military action there. Spain, Ireland and Norway will officially recognise a Palestinian state on Tuesday, despite an angry reaction from Israel, which has found itself increasingly isolated after more than seven months of conflict in Gaza. The three nations have painted their decision as a way to speed efforts to secure a ceasefire in Israel’s war with Hamas. More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s offensive, Gaza’s health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area. Photo: IDF",

The Macalope’s not holding his breath, but if Siri can make a large phone easier to use, that helps.Still, none of this addresses what the Macalope calls “pants feel” (no, don’t close the tab, we’re keeping it SFW). Big phones are simply bigger. The amazing thing about AirPods is how they took advantage of that little jeans pocket no one uses anymore. Apple shipped a product a lot of people already had a place to put. Large phones, on the other hand, have forced a proliferation of tactical phone pants, those pants that have a special phone pocket on the thigh, because if your pants aren’t saying “I have a large phone!” it’s such a missed opportunity.Might as well have been bandoliers.At the end of the day, does the Macalope want a thinner iPhone? Yes, please. And he can probably find a way to make it work.Of course, a thinner and smaller phone would be the real sweet spot. Just saying.iPhone",

Now the Macalope has to inform you that he lied a bit at the beginning. We are going to talk about AI, but just a little. Those aforementioned iOS 18 AI features include several enhancements that could make interacting with your phone easier and faster. The Macalope’s not holding his breath, but if Siri can make a large phone easier to use, that helps. Still, none of this addresses what the Macalope calls “pants feel” (no, don’t close the tab, we’re keeping it SFW). Big phones are simply . The amazing thing about AirPods is how they took advantage of that little jeans pocket no one uses anymore. Apple shipped a product a lot of people already had a place to put. Large phones, on the other hand, have forced a proliferation of tactical phone pants, those pants that have a special phone pocket on the thigh, because if your pants aren’t saying “I have a large phone!” it’s such a missed opportunity. Might as well have been bandoliers. At the end of the day, does the Macalope want a thinner iPhone? Yes, please. And he can probably find a way to make it work. Of course, a thinner smaller phone would be the real sweet spot. Just saying. In addition to being a mythical beast, the Macalope is not an employee of Macworld. As a result, the Macalope is always free to criticize any media organization. Even ours.",

        "description": "—Phase 3 Study Achieves Primary Endpoint for Both Dosage Strengths of Brensocatib with Statistically Significant and Clinically Meaningful Reduction in Frequency of Pulmonary Exacerbations Versus Placebo— —Treatment with Brensocatib Also Achieves Statistical Significance on Multiple...",
        "content": ", /PRNewswire/ -- Insmed Incorporated (Nasdaq: ), a global biopharmaceutical company on a mission to transform the lives of patients with serious and rare diseases, today announced positive topline results from the study, a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of brensocatib in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. The study met its primary endpoint, with both dosage strengths of brensocatib demonstrating statistically significant reductions in the annualized rate of pulmonary exacerbations (PEs) versus placebo. The study also met several of its prespecified secondary endpoints with statistical significance. Based on these results, Insmed plans to file a New Drug Application (NDA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for brensocatib in patients with bronchiectasis in the fourth quarter of 2024. Pending regulatory approvals, Insmed anticipates a U.S. launch for brensocatib in mid-2025 followed by launches in and in the first half of 2026. If approved, brensocatib would be the first approved treatment for patients with bronchiectasis as well as the first approved dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1) inhibitor—a new mechanism of action with the potential to address a range of neutrophil-mediated diseases. Topline efficacy results from the study are as follows: \"I am thrilled that the study has demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful treatment effect for brensocatib compared with placebo, underscoring the impact this investigational therapy may have on patients with bronchiectasis,\" said lead study investigator , MBChB, Ph.D., Professor and Consultant Respiratory Physician at the School of Medicine, University of . \"Today, there is no approved treatment for bronchiectasis and there remains an urgent need for a therapy that can reduce exacerbations. As a DPP1 inhibitor, brensocatib would be the first treatment in its class and could offer a completely new approach to managing this difficult-to-treat patient population, heralding a new era in clinical management of bronchiectasis.\" As part of the study's conduct, more than 460 trial sites were engaged in nearly 40 countries. After excluding sites that did not enroll any patients and all sites in , the total number of active sites in was 391 sites in 35 countries. Adult patients (ages 18 to 85 years) were randomized 1:1:1 and adolescent patients (ages 12 to <18 years) were randomized 2:2:1 for treatment with brensocatib 10 mg, brensocatib 25 mg, or placebo once daily for 52 weeks, followed by 4 weeks off treatment. The primary efficacy analysis included data from 1,680 adult patients and 41 adolescent patients. Brensocatib was well-tolerated in the study. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurring in at least 5.0% of patients treated with either dose of brensocatib and more frequently than in placebo were COVID-19 (15.8%, 20.9%, 15.8%), nasopharyngitis (7.7%, 6.3%, 7.6%), cough (7.0%, 6.1%, 6.4%), and headache (6.7%, 8.5%, and 6.9%) for brensocatib 10 mg, brensocatib 25 mg, and placebo, respectively. Additional TEAEs and treatment-emergent adverse events of special interest (TEAESIs) are as follows: \"We are incredibly excited about the topline results from the pivotal study and what they may mean for patients. These findings not only underscore our belief that brensocatib has the potential to transform the treatment landscape for bronchiectasis, but they also further validate DPP1 inhibition as a mechanism that may hold promise in other neutrophil-mediated diseases,\" said , M.D., MBA, Chief Medical Officer of Insmed. \"Today's outcome is the result of years of hard work and dedication by many members of the Insmed team, and I'd like to thank them for their efforts. We are especially grateful to the clinical investigators, site staff, patients, and families who made this study possible. We now look forward to further analyzing the data while rapidly advancing toward regulatory filings in our key regions, where we believe approximately 1 million bronchiectasis patients may benefit from an approved treatment.\" Brensocatib has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA and was granted access to the Priority Medicines (PRIME) scheme by the European Medicines Agency for patients with bronchiectasis. Insmed plans to present detailed results from the study at an upcoming medical meeting. Insmed is also advancing the development of brensocatib in other neutrophil-driven inflammatory diseases with significant health burdens and limited treatment options. A Phase 2 study in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) is currently underway, and Insmed plans to initiate a Phase 2 study in hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in the second half of 2024. Insmed looks forward to hosting a commercial webinar on , at , where the Company's commercial leadership will provide details on the market outlook for its three most advanced programs, ARIKAYCE (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension), brensocatib, and treprostinil palmitil inhalation powder (TPIP). Insmed management will host a conference call for investors beginning at , May 28, to discuss the results. Shareholders and other interested parties may participate in the conference call by dialing (800) 715-9871 (U.S.) or (646) 307-1963 (international) and referencing access code 1245105. The call will also be webcast live on the Company's website at . A replay of the conference call will be accessible approximately one hour after its completion through June 27, 2024, by dialing (800) 770-2030 (U.S.) or (609) 800-9909 (international) and referencing access code 1245105. A webcast of the call will also be archived for 90 days under the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at . Bronchiectasis is a serious, chronic lung disease in which the bronchi become permanently dilated due to a cycle of infection, inflammation, and lung tissue damage. The condition is marked by frequent pulmonary exacerbations requiring antibiotic therapy and/or hospitalizations. Symptoms include chronic cough, excessive sputum production, shortness of breath, and repeated respiratory infections, which can worsen the underlying condition. Bronchiectasis affects approximately 450,000 patients in the U.S., 400,000 patients in , and 150,000 patients in , and there are currently no approved therapies specifically targeting bronchiectasis in these regions. Brensocatib is a small molecule, oral, reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1) being developed by Insmed for the treatment of patients with bronchiectasis, CRSsNP, and other neutrophil-mediated diseases. DPP1 is an enzyme responsible for activating neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs), such as neutrophil elastase, in neutrophils when they are formed in the bone marrow. Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell and play an essential role in pathogen destruction and inflammatory mediation. In chronic inflammatory lung diseases, neutrophils accumulate in the airways and result in excessive active NSPs that cause lung destruction and inflammation. Brensocatib may decrease the damaging effects of inflammatory diseases such as bronchiectasis by inhibiting DPP1 and its activation of NSPs. Brensocatib is an investigational drug product that has not been approved for any indication in any jurisdiction. Insmed Incorporated is a global biopharmaceutical company on a mission to transform the lives of patients with serious and rare diseases. Insmed's first commercial product is a first-in-disease therapy approved in the United States, Europe, and Japan to treat a chronic, debilitating lung disease. The Company is progressing a robust pipeline of investigational therapies targeting areas of serious unmet need, including neutrophil-mediated inflammatory diseases and rare pulmonary disorders. Insmed is also advancing an early-stage research engine encompassing a wide range of technologies and modalities, including artificial intelligence-driven protein engineering, gene therapy, and protein manufacturing. Insmed is headquartered in Bridgewater, New Jersey, with additional offices and research locations throughout the United States, Europe, and Japan. Visit to learn more.

Your family isn’t growing and no one seems to be eating more, but you find yourself running short more often. And you wonder why. There’s a reason with a fancy name – shrinkflation. Prices for many products have increased and food wholesalers seem to always have an excuse. Some gripe the cost of raw ingredients jumped. Some say poultry and egg prices went up because farmers are spending more to prevent the spread of bird flu and meat prices are higher because the cost of labor in processing plants is getting higher.",

        "content": "We expect to see wrinkles, gray hair sometimes no hair, age spots and other signs of healthy aging. Changes are expected, and welcomed as rights-of-passage to the golden years. Aging also takes its toll on the feet and ankles, just as it does with the rest of the body. The following are some changes that occur in the foot and ankle and what you can do to manage them as you embrace healthy aging. Due to years of assault on the heart and blood vessels from a poor diet or lack or physical activity, there can be many changes in the circulation system. Diabetes, smoking and other diseases can also affect the blood flow. Varicose veins are also seen more often in the elderly. Poor circulation cause pain in the feet or legs especially when walking or even at rest. The specific circulation problems will be diagnosed and treated by your podiatrist, vascular specialist or family physician. Once diagnosed, treatment can begin, often with medications, proper footwear and hosiery, stockings or socks. Lifestyle changes including healthy diet, physical activity and stress management will also help with circulation issues. For venous problems: Mild to moderate compression stockings/socks with at least 15 millimeters of pressure should be used. They should be put on first thing in the morning before putting your feet down and before the swelling sets in. If people have low blood flow to the feet, they are encouraged to wear socks that are loose and do not leave “tight rings” around the ankles. They should be comfortable to wear at all times and can be worn to bed at night to keep the feet warm. All people with circulation problems should be closely followed by the vascular doctor. Dry, flaky skin: With increasing age, the skin’s ability to produce sweat, oil, and other fatty substances diminishes. The skin cells also divide more slowly, and the skin becomes thinner. As a result, the water content of skin is reduced and the skin becomes dry, which in turn leads to age-related dry skin. Common age-related dry skin problems people may experience include peeling and flaking skin, and itchy skin that bleeds easily when scratched. The skin may appear yellow or brown in color, and may become inflamed due to itching and scratching. The dry skin may become thick and hard, especially around the edges of the heels. The skin may become so dry that it cracks and fissures, which in turn causes pain when walking. Dry and cracked skin is prone to bacteria and fungal infections, which can cause serious problems. Self-help treatments: Moisturize, moisturize, and moisturize again, especially soon after bathing. Pat your skin almost dry – but while it is still damp, apply the moisturizer. The moisturizer will hold the water in, and keep the skin from drying. You can add some oil to your bath to soothe dry irritated skin and help the skin “lock in” moisture. Avoid nylon and rayon socks because they may cause dryness. Seeing a podiatrist can help with exfoliating and moisturizing the feet to soften and hydrate the skin. Thick, dry, and discolored toenails: The toenail changes most commonly associated with aging are due to a decrease in blood flow to the toes. As we age, the small blood vessels in our feet and toes narrow and become thicker, reducing the amount of blood and nutrients that get to the ends of our feet. Without proper nourishment the toenails become dry, brittle, deformed, and discolored. Trauma to the nails over the years gradually destroys the normal appearance of the nails, cuticle, and nail bed. Nail fungus is the most common cause of discolored, thick, and deformed toenails in people of all ages, but especially in older persons. Seniors are especially susceptible to these infections because of reduced blood flow to the toes. Decreased circulation also means fewer medication and infection fighting blood cells getting to the area to fight the nail fungi. Self-help and treatments: Help avoid ingrown toenails and nail fungus by clipping toenails straight across, and disinfect instruments used to cut nails. Do not cut or push back toenail cuticles. When the cuticles are left intact, they keep germs from entering the area where new nail grows from. People, who have sweaty feet, or those who practice poor foot hygiene, are more susceptible to skin fungal which can lead to nail fungus. Daily wash and dry feet, and put on a pair of clean, socks. Constantly wearing nail polish prevents the air from getting to the nail plate and the harsh chemicals in the nail polish may help to destroy the normal structure of the nail. This can make it easier for a fungus to invade and penetrate the nail. The dark, warm, moist environment in our shoes makes it a perfect place for the fungus to grow. Change shoes and make sure they are clean and dry. The fungus must be treated, often with antifungal medication applied to the nail or skin. Crooked toes and feet: As we age, the ligaments, tendons, and joint capsule begins to weaken and stretch. When this occurs, the bones are not held tightly in their correct position and they begin to move out of alignment. The joint’s cartilage is wearing down due to the normal wear and tear leading to thickened joints, and toes that are no longer straight, but are crooked. This can lead to deformities such as hammer toes, bunions, flat feet, etc. Self-help and treatments: Need to be directed toward keeping your feet and toes comfortable. It is best to measure your feet, regularly and especially when you buy new shoes. Stand when your feet are measured because your feet expand when standing. Make sure you have at least a little fingers width between your longest toe and the end of your shoe. Always wear appropriate shoe styles – the shoes need to match the shape of your feet. Do not purchase shoes that feel too tight, expecting them to “stretch to fit.” Most materials, including leather, do not stretch enough to make a big difference. If you have hammertoes, corns and calluses, bunions, arthritis of the toes, consider purchasing shoes with a deep and wide toe box (the front area of the shoe where the toes are.) This extra depth and width may keep the shoes from pressing against sensitive skin on the tops of the toes. This is especially important for people with diabetes circulation problems. Custom-made orthotics may help address any biomechanical challenges, and help with comfort and control. Sometimes surgery may be needed to correct these foot deformities as well. Regular exercise like walking and maintaining a healthy diet and weight goes a long way to help prevent foot complications and promote good foot health well into the senior years. Changes to the foot and ankle can and do occur with healthy aging but it does not have to lead to pain and dysfunction. If you do have pain or concerns about your feet, see a podiatrist to have a full evaluation and treatment, if needed.

        "content": ", /PRNewswire/ -- a biotechnology company developing a clinical pipeline of orally administered, small molecule therapies for chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, today announced participation in the following industry and scientific conferences in June: Immunic, Inc. (Nasdaq: ) is a biotechnology company developing a clinical pipeline of orally administered, small molecule therapies for chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The company's lead development program, vidofludimus calcium (IMU-838), is currently in phase 3 and phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of relapsing and progressive multiple sclerosis, respectively, and has shown therapeutic activity in phase 2 clinical trials in patients suffering from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, progressive multiple sclerosis and moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. Vidofludimus calcium combines neuroprotective effects, through its mechanism as a first-in-class nuclear receptor related 1 (Nurr1) activator, with additional anti-inflammatory and anti-viral effects, by selectively inhibiting the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). IMU-856, which targets the protein Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), is intended to restore intestinal barrier function and regenerate bowel epithelium, which could potentially be applicable in numerous gastrointestinal diseases, such as celiac disease, for which it is currently in preparations for a phase 2 clinical trial. IMU-381, which currently is in preclinical testing, is a next generation molecule being developed to specifically address the needs of gastrointestinal diseases.

Living in Oakville, Ontario, at the time, Keefe had a nearly two-and-a-half hour commute to the arena in prime rush hour — meaning he had to leave his home at 5 a.m. just to make it on time for practice. Perplexed, Han, the son of Chinese immigrants, tossed out a bold idea that would help his head coach optimize his time during those taxing rides.",

        "content": ", /PRNewswire/ -- Insmed Incorporated (Nasdaq: ), a global biopharmaceutical company on a mission to transform the lives of patients with serious and rare diseases, today announced positive topline results from the study, a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of brensocatib in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. The study met its primary endpoint, with both dosage strengths of brensocatib demonstrating statistically significant reductions in the annualized rate of pulmonary exacerbations (PEs) versus placebo. The study also met several of its prespecified secondary endpoints with statistical significance. Based on these results, Insmed plans to file a New Drug Application (NDA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for brensocatib in patients with bronchiectasis in the fourth quarter of 2024. Pending regulatory approvals, Insmed anticipates a U.S. launch for brensocatib in mid-2025 followed by launches in and in the first half of 2026. If approved, brensocatib would be the first approved treatment for patients with bronchiectasis as well as the first approved dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1) inhibitor—a new mechanism of action with the potential to address a range of neutrophil-mediated diseases. Topline efficacy results from the study are as follows: \"I am thrilled that the study has demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful treatment effect for brensocatib compared with placebo, underscoring the impact this investigational therapy may have on patients with bronchiectasis,\" said lead study investigator , MBChB, Ph.D., Professor and Consultant Respiratory Physician at the School of Medicine, University of . \"Today, there is no approved treatment for bronchiectasis and there remains an urgent need for a therapy that can reduce exacerbations. As a DPP1 inhibitor, brensocatib would be the first treatment in its class and could offer a completely new approach to managing this difficult-to-treat patient population, heralding a new era in clinical management of bronchiectasis.\" As part of the study's conduct, more than 460 trial sites were engaged in nearly 40 countries. After excluding sites that did not enroll any patients and all sites in , the total number of active sites in was 391 sites in 35 countries. Adult patients (ages 18 to 85 years) were randomized 1:1:1 and adolescent patients (ages 12 to <18 years) were randomized 2:2:1 for treatment with brensocatib 10 mg, brensocatib 25 mg, or placebo once daily for 52 weeks, followed by 4 weeks off treatment. The primary efficacy analysis included data from 1,680 adult patients and 41 adolescent patients. Brensocatib was well-tolerated in the study. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurring in at least 5.0% of patients treated with either dose of brensocatib and more frequently than in placebo were COVID-19 (15.8%, 20.9%, 15.8%), nasopharyngitis (7.7%, 6.3%, 7.6%), cough (7.0%, 6.1%, 6.4%), and headache (6.7%, 8.5%, and 6.9%) for brensocatib 10 mg, brensocatib 25 mg, and placebo, respectively. Additional TEAEs and treatment-emergent adverse events of special interest (TEAESIs) are as follows: \"We are incredibly excited about the topline results from the pivotal study and what they may mean for patients. These findings not only underscore our belief that brensocatib has the potential to transform the treatment landscape for bronchiectasis, but they also further validate DPP1 inhibition as a mechanism that may hold promise in other neutrophil-mediated diseases,\" said , M.D., MBA, Chief Medical Officer of Insmed. \"Today's outcome is the result of years of hard work and dedication by many members of the Insmed team, and I'd like to thank them for their efforts. We are especially grateful to the clinical investigators, site staff, patients, and families who made this study possible. We now look forward to further analyzing the data while rapidly advancing toward regulatory filings in our key regions, where we believe approximately 1 million bronchiectasis patients may benefit from an approved treatment.\" Brensocatib has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA and was granted access to the Priority Medicines (PRIME) scheme by the European Medicines Agency for patients with bronchiectasis. Insmed plans to present detailed results from the study at an upcoming medical meeting. Insmed is also advancing the development of brensocatib in other neutrophil-driven inflammatory diseases with significant health burdens and limited treatment options. A Phase 2 study in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) is currently underway, and Insmed plans to initiate a Phase 2 study in hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in the second half of 2024. Insmed looks forward to hosting a commercial webinar on , at , where the Company's commercial leadership will provide details on the market outlook for its three most advanced programs, ARIKAYCE (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension), brensocatib, and treprostinil palmitil inhalation powder (TPIP). Insmed management will host a conference call for investors beginning at , May 28, to discuss the results. Shareholders and other interested parties may participate in the conference call by dialing (800) 715-9871 (U.S.) or (646) 307-1963 (international) and referencing access code 1245105. The call will also be webcast live on the Company's website at . A replay of the conference call will be accessible approximately one hour after its completion through June 27, 2024, by dialing (800) 770-2030 (U.S.) or (609) 800-9909 (international) and referencing access code 1245105. A webcast of the call will also be archived for 90 days under the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at . Bronchiectasis is a serious, chronic lung disease in which the bronchi become permanently dilated due to a cycle of infection, inflammation, and lung tissue damage. The condition is marked by frequent pulmonary exacerbations requiring antibiotic therapy and/or hospitalizations. Symptoms include chronic cough, excessive sputum production, shortness of breath, and repeated respiratory infections, which can worsen the underlying condition. Bronchiectasis affects approximately 450,000 patients in the U.S., 400,000 patients in , and 150,000 patients in , and there are currently no approved therapies specifically targeting bronchiectasis in these regions. Brensocatib is a small molecule, oral, reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1) being developed by Insmed for the treatment of patients with bronchiectasis, CRSsNP, and other neutrophil-mediated diseases. DPP1 is an enzyme responsible for activating neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs), such as neutrophil elastase, in neutrophils when they are formed in the bone marrow. Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell and play an essential role in pathogen destruction and inflammatory mediation. In chronic inflammatory lung diseases, neutrophils accumulate in the airways and result in excessive active NSPs that cause lung destruction and inflammation. Brensocatib may decrease the damaging effects of inflammatory diseases such as bronchiectasis by inhibiting DPP1 and its activation of NSPs. Brensocatib is an investigational drug product that has not been approved for any indication in any jurisdiction. Insmed Incorporated is a global biopharmaceutical company on a mission to transform the lives of patients with serious and rare diseases. Insmed's first commercial product is a first-in-disease therapy approved in the United States, Europe, and Japan to treat a chronic, debilitating lung disease. The Company is progressing a robust pipeline of investigational therapies targeting areas of serious unmet need, including neutrophil-mediated inflammatory diseases and rare pulmonary disorders. Insmed is also advancing an early-stage research engine encompassing a wide range of technologies and modalities, including artificial intelligence-driven protein engineering, gene therapy, and protein manufacturing. Insmed is headquartered in Bridgewater, New Jersey, with additional offices and research locations throughout the United States, Europe, and Japan. Visit to learn more.

An Alienware representative told me this machine is Alienware’s “most premium ever.” It comes at a premium price, too — this is the kind of machine you pick if you want a polished experience with an all-metal chassis, mechanical keyboard, and high-end speakers. It’s not a value-focused gaming laptop that will give you the most gaming performance possible at the lowest price point. But if a more premium design is what you’re looking for, this might be the gaming laptop for you.Looking for other options? Check out PCWorld’s roundup of the best gaming laptops.Alienware x16 R2: SpecsIDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanThe Alienware x16 R2 is a 16-inch gaming laptop with a lot of powerful hardware inside. Our review model had a high-end Intel Core Ultra 9 185H CPU, but the base model is also available with a Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155H CPU. These are both Intel Meteor Lake CPUs, which means this laptop comes with the neural processing unit hardware that may become important to take advantage of AI features in Windows and other applications one day.The model we reviewed had Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 graphics hardware, but Alienware also offers a higher-end model with GeForce RTX 4090 hardware — or you can step down and choose an RTX 4060 or RTX 4070.Alienware included 32 GB of RAM our review model, but the base model has 16 GB. Additionally, we had a machine 1 TB of solid-state storage, but you can get versions of this laptop that come with a built-in RAID — up to two 4TB storage drives for a combined 8TB of solid-state storage.The Alienware x16 R2 we got our hands on had a mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX ultra low-profle switches, but the base model comes standard with an “Alienware X Series keyboard” — a more traditional laptop keyboard.Finally, the laptop we reviewed included a 16-inch 2560×1600 resolution IPS display with a 240Hz refresh rate. Alienware told us you can also get this laptop with a 2220×1080 display with a blazing-fast 480Hz refresh rate.CPU: Intel Core Ultra 9 185HMemory: 32GB LPDDR5X, 7467MT/sGraphics/GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080Display: 16-inch 2560×1600 IPS display with 240Hz refresh rateStorage: 1TB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSDWebcam: 1080p webcam with HDRConnectivity: 1x Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C with Power Delivery and DisplayPort), 1x USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 with DisplayPort, 2x USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, 1x HDMI 2.1, 1x Mini DisplayPort 1.4, 1x combo headset jack, 1x microSD card slot, 1x DC power inNetworking: Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4Biometrics: IR camera for Windows HelloBattery capacity: 90 Watt-hoursDimensions: 14.36 x 11.41 x 0.73 inchesWeight: 5.86 poundsMSRP: $3,199 as tested ($2099 base price)Alienware x16 R2: Design and build qualityIDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanThe Alienware x16 R2 is a well-designed gaming laptop. While it’s a 16-inch gaming laptop weighing in at nearly six pounds, the curved edges ensure it doesn’t look or feel too blocky. Alienware calls the color scheme “Lunar Silver.” The laptop’s lid is silver with a glowing alien head logo you can customize the color of, the inside of the laptop is black, and the back of the laptop — where all the ports are conveniently placed — is framed in white. The design is very Alienware, but it’s polished and not gaudy or over the top — as far as gaming laptops go.This is a laptop with a full metal chassis. The lid and bottom of the laptop are made from anodized aluminum, there’s stainless steel around the keyboard, and the palm rest is made of a magnesium alloy. It feels nice to hold, and the solid metals give the laptop more of a premium feel than less-expensive gaming laptops that are often just made of plastic. (Plastic is fine and there’s nothing wrong with it, but there’s certainly something that feels high end about a nice metal laptop.)There’s no weird flex to the laptop’s chassis, and the screen is very solid — it wobbles very little when you adjust its position.IDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanThe LEDs are well integrated: The keyboard offers per-key backlighting, and the entire touchpad’s surface has backlighting, too. (The touchpad backlighting turns on when you’re using it and then fades away a few seconds after you take your finger off of it, so it’s not always distracting.) The alien head logo on the lid is backlit, too.The back of the laptop also has “stadium” backlighting, with a sleek-looking lightbar around the panel with the ports on the back of the laptop. All this “AlienFX” backlighting is customizable in the included Alienware Command Center software. But, out of the box, everything is a nice shade of blue — no over-the-top rainbow effect the first time you boot it up. (But you can configure it to look like that, if you like!)It’s also worth noting that the touchpad and “stadium” backlighting on the back of the laptop have “100 micro LEDs,” according to Alienware. This means you can customize them with a variety of different colors and effects — you don’t have to choose just a single color.Alienware x16 R2: Keyboard and trackpadIDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanThe Alienware x16 R2 we reviewed had an excellent keyboard. This is no surprise — the model we reviewed came with a mechanical keyboard with CherryMX ultra-low profile switches. Since this is a mechanical keyboard, the keys have a great tactile feel and “clickiness” to them — totally different from the standard keyboards you’ll experience on the average laptop.Mechanical keyboards aren’t too common on gaming laptops. They’re usually found more on the external keyboards you’d use with desktop gaming PCs.While I’m a big fan of mechanical keyboards — and so are many other gamers and PC users in general — they’re not a must-have feature. If you’ve never tried a mechanical keyboard, you should give one a try in person to decide how important this feature is to you, since it’s an additional upcharge and not included on the base model.Mechanical keyboards tend to be on the loud side. While this is fairly quiet for a mechanical keyboard, it’s definitely a bit noisier than the average non-mechanical keyboard. If you’ll be gaming in a quiet room with someone sleeping next to you, the mechanical keyboard version of this laptop probably isn’t ideal. Otherwise, the sound is probably no big deal.This laptop’s touchpad also feels excellent with a pleasantly smooth surface and good location. I’ve used gaming laptops with larger touchpads, but the touchpad’s size was never an issue — and the compact size ensures palm rejection works well, too. I wasn’t accidentally bumping it while typing.Alienware x16 R2: Display and speakersIDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanThe Alienware x16 R2 has a 16-inch 2560×1600 IPS display with a 240Hz refresh rate. The display looks good, but there are some things you need to be aware of.First, this laptop’s display doesn’t have full support for HDR. Alienware says it supports Dolby Vision videos, so that will be nice when streaming Dolby Vision-enabled content. But this is a gaming laptop, and it’s notable that the display does not support HDR in video games.Speaking of brightness, this display is on the dim side. It offers just 300 nits of brightness. Other high-end gaming laptops — the Asus ROG Strix Scar, for example — offer 500 nits of brightness.The laptop looked good while gaming. It felt a lot brighter and looked better than the on-paper brightness numbers would lead me to expect. And that 240Hz refresh rate makes for a smooth experience. But the Alienware x16 R2 is definitely behind some of its competitors on brightness and HDR.The x16 R2’s speakers sound excellent — perhaps the best speakers I’ve ever heard in a gaming laptop. You’re getting a decent amount of bass (for a laptop.) It’s a six-speaker system with two upward-firing tweeters, one on each side of the keyboard. If you plan to do a lot of gaming with the laptop’s speakers — rather than plugging in a pair of headphones or external speakers — you’re getting a worthwhile premium speaker setup with this laptop.Alienware x16 R2: Webcam, microphone, biometricsIDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanThe Alienware x16 R2 comes with a 1080p webcam with HDR. The webcam looks good — much better than the cheap 720p webcams that are often found in lower-end laptops. Also, thanks to the neural processing units (NPUs) included with Intel’s Meteor Lake chips, you get access to Windows Studio Effects — a suite of AI effects like Eye Contact that makes it look like you’re always looking at your webcam when you aren’t, as well as blurring your background and framing the video around your face.The dual-array microphones work well for built-in microphones. I still would want to use a dedicated microphone for gaming sessions — especially if you’re blasting sound from those speakers — but the microphone setup is perfectly serviceable for online meetings or for gaming in a pinch.The Alienware also comes with an IR camera for Windows Hello. It reliably signed me into Windows with my face in a variety of different lighting conditions. It’s a great convenience feature to have, and I missed Windows Hello when I reviewed a gaming laptop without it recently.Alienware x16 R2: ConnectivityIDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanThe Alienware x16 R2 has a rich selection of ports and great connectivity options — with the notable exception of an Ethernet port for a wired network connection, which is a popular feature on desktop-replacement laptops like this one.All the ports on this laptop are conveniently located on the back of the laptop, ensuring cables aren’t sticking out to the sides of your laptop and getting in the way. Of course, if you’re a fan of USB and headset jacks on the side of your laptop, this may not be the machine for you — but you could always plug in in a USB-C hub or dongle for easier access.On the back of the laptop, you’ll find a combo headphone jack, a microSD card reader slot, an HDMI 2.1 port, a Mini DisplayPort, and a power jack. You’ll also find a total of four USB ports: This machine has two USB-C ports, one of which is a Thunderbolt 4 port and one of which is a USB 3.2 Gen 2 port. There are also two USB-A ports, both of which support USB 3.2 Gen 1.When it comes to wireless networking, this laptop is as futureproof as you can get thanks to its support for Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4. You probably don’t have a Wi-Fi 7 router yet, so it’s not essential to have right now — but it means this laptop’s hardware will be ready when you upgrade your router. (Wi-Fi 7 connectivity isn’t available at launch and will be activated later in the year with a software update, according to Alienware.)There’s one big omission: This laptop doesn’t offer a built-in Ethernet jack for wired network connections. Most gaming laptops of this size offer built-in Ethernet connectivity, but of course not everyone uses it. You’ll need a dongle if you want to connect it to your network via Ethernet — otherwise you’ll just be using Wi-Fi.Alienware x16 R2: PerformanceThe Alienware x16 R2 delivered great performance in both gaming and day-to-day desktop use — that’s no surprise thanks to the high-end Intel Core Ultra 9 185H, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 graphics hardware, and 32GB of RAM.I enjoyed playing Cyberpunk 2077’s Phantom Liberty expansion with maxxed-out settings. The Alienware x16 R2 generates a lot of heat, but it has the cooling system to deal with it. Alienware says it has “Alienware Cryo-tech cooling technology,” and whatever it’s called, it worked well. It definitely moves a lot of hot air away from the laptop. The keyboard and other places you’d touch on the laptop stay cool enough that it’s not a problem.But benchmarks will tell the full story. As always, we ran the Alienware x16 R2 through our standard benchmarks to see how it really performs.IDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanFirst, we run PCMark 10 to get an idea of overall system performance. While this is supposed to be an overall system performance benchmark, the CPU has a bigger impact than the GPU here. The 16-inch Alienware x16 R2 delivered a score of 7664.That’s about what we’d expect to see — Alienware’s 18-inch m18 R2 with its Intel Core i9 185H CPU beats it. The Gigabyte Aorus 16X with its Intel Core i7-14650HX CPU also edges out the CPU in this Alienware laptop, but only by a little bit. Those Intel HX CPUs are delivering slightly better top-end performance than Intel’s latest Meteor Lake CPUs. Meteor Lake CPUs are more focused on power efficiency and AI performance, with their integrated neural processing unit.IDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanNext, we run Cinebench R20. This is a heavily multithreaded benchmark that focuses on overall CPU performance. It’s a quick benchmark, so cooling isn’t a huge factor. Since it’s multithreaded, CPUs with more cores deliver more performance and get higher scores.The Alienware x16 R2 delivered a score of 7742. That’s a few notches below the Gigabyte Aorus 16X. Despite the Aorus having a “Core i7” CPU with a 7 in the model number rather than a 9, that particular CPU outperforms the Intel Core Ultra 9 in this laptop. If top-end CPU performance is what’s important to you, you’ll probably want a gaming laptop with an HX chip.However, this isn’t representative of real-world gaming performance — these CPU differences don’t necessarily make that much of a difference in games, which are much more about GPU performance. A laptop’s cooling system is also an important factor, as we’ll see below.IDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanWe also encode a video file with Handbrake. This is another heavily multithreaded benchmark, but it runs over an extended period of time. This demands the laptop’s cooling kick in, and many laptops will throttle and slow down under load.The Alienware x16 R2 completed our standard encode process in 728 seconds — that’s just over 12 minutes. Interestingly enough, the Alienware x16 R2 outperformed the Gigabyte Aorus x16 R2 that beat it in the Cinebench benchmark. That suggests that the Alienware x16 R2 has a better cooling system that does a better job of keeping its CPU running cool under load, even if the CPU in the Aorus does have higher top-end performance.IDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanNext, we run a graphical benchmark — the most important type of benchmark for gauging gaming performance. We run 3Dmark Time Spy, a graphical benchmark that focuses on GPU performance.The results give us a look at how the different Nvidia GeForce RTX GPUs compare to each other. The Alienware x16 R2, with its Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 GPU, delivered an average score of 17089. That’s a great score — a no-expenses-spared RTX 4090 is only 22 percent faster here. The RTX 4080 is significantly faster than the RTX 4070 — and much faster than the RTX 4060 and RTX 4050.Next, we run the benchmarks in some games. First, we use the built-in benchmark in Shadow of the Tomb Raider to test all the gaming laptops we review. It’s an older game, but it’s a great way to compare graphical performance across different PCs.IDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanThe Alienware x16 R2 ran the benchmark with an average performance of 166 frames per second. Once again, the RTX 4080 in the model we reviewed was slower than the top-of-the-line RTX 4090, but significantly faster than the RTX 4070.Finally, we run the built-in benchmark in Metro Exodus. This is a more demanding game, and we set the benchmark to 1080p resolution at the Extreme detail setting.IDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanThe Alienware x16 R2 delivered an average FPS of 72. Again, that’s midway between the performance of an RTX 4070 and an RTX 4090.Overall, the Alienware x16 R2 delivered excellent performance. But this laptop is very customizable, and graphics performance will come down to which GPU you choose to put in your Alienware x16 R2 at checkout.You may be able to get more top-end CPU performance by opting for a different laptop with an HX CPU instead of a Meteor Lake Core Ultra CPU — but remember that cooling is important, too. A Core Ultra-based laptop like this one may still deliver better sustained CPU performance than an HX-based laptop that has to throttle down to stay cool, as we saw in the Handbrake encode benchmark.Alienware x16 R2: Battery lifeGaming laptops aren’t known for their long battery life, but the Alienware x16 R2 has a built-in 90 Watt-hour battery. That should deliver decent life — it’s nearly the biggest battery you can get. The largest batteries in gaming laptops top out around 99 Watt-hours, as the U.S. Transportation Security Administration won’t let you take larger batteries on airplanes.IDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanIDG / Chris HoffmanTo benchmark the battery life, we play a 4K copy of Tears of Steel on repeat in the Movies & TV app on Windows 11 with airplane mode enabled until the laptop suspends itself. We set the screen to 250 nits of brightness for our battery benchmark. This is a best-case scenario for any laptop since local video playback is so efficient. Bear in mind that real battery life in day-to-day use is always going to be less than this as you use various applications.The Alienware x16 R2 delivered surprisingly good battery life for a 16-inch gaming laptop, running for an average of 425 minutes — that’s just over seven hours. It lasted 15 minutes longer than the Gigabyte Aorus 16X, despite that laptop having a larger 99 Watt-hour battery. This may be down to the difference in CPUs — as mentioned, the Meteor Lake-based Core Ultra CPU in this laptop is more focused on power efficiency than those HX CPUs, which are more focused on top-end performance.It’s a great result for a gaming laptop. You aren’t going to be using this laptop away from an outlet for an entire eight-hour workday, but you have plenty of battery life to go for hours away from an outlet when you need it. (Bear in mind that all gaming laptops run games slower when they aren’t plugged in, so you’ll want to plug into an outlet to play games, anyway.)Alienware x16 R2: ConclusionThe Alienware x16 R2 is a polished 16-inch gaming laptop with a good-lucking design, a nice all-metal chassis with great build quality, lots of customizable LEDs, and a collection of ports smartly placed on the back of the laptop. The mechanical keyboard on our review model felt great, too. It’s also very customizable with a wide range of different CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage options, and the configuration of our review model delivered great performance with excellent cooling.There are a few weak points: You’ll find brighter displays elsewhere, and the lack of HDR support within games does feel like a shame at this high price point. Neither are deal-breakers, but they’d be nice to have upgrades on a premium gaming laptop. Additionally, if you want to use an Ethernet cable with your laptop, you won’t find that here — I know that will be a deal-breaker for some people.Our review model was $3,199, so we’re definitely not in budget gaming laptop territory here. But the machine we reviewed was a high-end gaming laptop with an RTX 4080, mechanical keyboard, all-metal chassis, impressive speakers, and unusually long battery life for a gaming laptop. You’re paying extra for these things.The base model starts at $2,099, which is a much lower cost than the model we reviewed— but you’re getting a Core Ultra 7 CPU, RTX 4060, 16GB of RAM, and no mechanical keyboard. These prices do feel a little high, and I expect you can save hundreds of dollars by choosing a less expensive gaming laptop with similar hardware — perhaps even an Alienware m16 R2. Those less-expensive laptops will probably be made of plastic instead of metal, though — and I don’t think their speakers will sound anywhere near as nice either. (Still, they may have brighter displays!)Overall, the Alienware x16 R2 is a premium product at a premium price point, and that’s mostly what you’re getting — but it would be nice if that display had premium-level brightness and HDR support, too.Laptops",
        "content": "The Alienware x16 R2 is a premium 16-inch gaming laptop at a premium price. But its mechanical keyboard and the highest-end hardware will cost you extra. $3,199 The is a high-end 16-inch gaming laptop. An Alienware representative told me this machine is Alienware’s “most premium ever.” It comes at a premium price, too — this is the kind of machine you pick if you want a polished experience with an all-metal chassis, mechanical keyboard, and high-end speakers. It’s not a value-focused gaming laptop that will give you the most gaming performance possible at the lowest price point. But if a more premium design is what you’re looking for, this might be the gaming laptop for you. Looking for other options? Check out PCWorld’s roundup of the . Alienware x16 R2: Specs IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman The Alienware x16 R2 is a 16-inch gaming laptop with a lot of powerful hardware inside. Our review model had a high-end Intel Core Ultra 9 185H CPU, but the base model is also available with a Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155H CPU. These are both Intel Meteor Lake CPUs, which means this laptop comes with the neural processing unit hardware that may become important to take advantage of AI features in Windows and other applications one day. The model we reviewed had Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 graphics hardware, but Alienware also offers a higher-end model with GeForce RTX 4090 hardware — or you can step down and choose an RTX 4060 or RTX 4070. Alienware included 32 GB of RAM our review model, but the base model has 16 GB. Additionally, we had a machine 1 TB of solid-state storage, but you can get versions of this laptop that come with a built-in RAID — up to two 4TB storage drives for a combined 8TB of solid-state storage. The Alienware x16 R2 we got our hands on had a with Cherry MX ultra low-profle switches, but the base model comes standard with an “Alienware X Series keyboard” — a more traditional laptop keyboard. Finally, the laptop we reviewed included a 16-inch 2560×1600 resolution IPS display with a 240Hz refresh rate. Alienware told us you can also get this laptop with a 2220×1080 display with a blazing-fast 480Hz refresh rate. Alienware x16 R2: Design and build quality IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman The Alienware x16 R2 is a well-designed gaming laptop. While it’s a 16-inch gaming laptop weighing in at nearly six pounds, the curved edges ensure it doesn’t look or feel too blocky. Alienware calls the color scheme “Lunar Silver.” The laptop’s lid is silver with a glowing alien head logo you can customize the color of, the inside of the laptop is black, and the back of the laptop — where all the ports are conveniently placed — is framed in white. The design is very Alienware, but it’s polished and not gaudy or over the top — as far as gaming laptops go. This is a laptop with a full metal chassis. The lid and bottom of the laptop are made from anodized aluminum, there’s stainless steel around the keyboard, and the palm rest is made of a magnesium alloy. It feels nice to hold, and the solid metals give the laptop more of a premium feel than less-expensive gaming laptops that are often just made of plastic. (Plastic is fine and there’s nothing wrong with it, but there’s certainly something that feels high end about a nice metal laptop.) There’s no weird flex to the laptop’s chassis, and the screen is very solid — it wobbles very little when you adjust its position. IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman The LEDs are well integrated: The keyboard offers per-key backlighting, and the entire touchpad’s surface has backlighting, too. (The touchpad backlighting turns on when you’re using it and then fades away a few seconds after you take your finger off of it, so it’s not always distracting.) The alien head logo on the lid is backlit, too. The back of the laptop also has “stadium” backlighting, with a sleek-looking lightbar around the panel with the ports on the back of the laptop. All this “AlienFX” backlighting is customizable in the included Alienware Command Center software. But, out of the box, everything is a nice shade of blue — no over-the-top rainbow effect the first time you boot it up. (But you can configure it to look like that, if you like!) It’s also worth noting that the touchpad and “stadium” backlighting on the back of the laptop have “100 micro LEDs,” according to Alienware. This means you can customize them with a variety of different colors and effects — you don’t have to choose just a single color. Alienware x16 R2: Keyboard and trackpad IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman The Alienware x16 R2 we reviewed had an excellent keyboard. This is no surprise — the model we reviewed came with a mechanical keyboard with CherryMX ultra-low profile switches. Since this is a mechanical keyboard, the keys have a great tactile feel and “clickiness” to them — totally different from the standard keyboards you’ll experience on the average laptop. Mechanical keyboards aren’t too common on gaming laptops. They’re usually found more on the external keyboards you’d use with desktop gaming PCs. While I’m a big fan of mechanical keyboards — and so are many other gamers and PC users in general — they’re not a must-have feature. If you’ve never tried a mechanical keyboard, you should give one a try in person to decide how important this feature is to you, since it’s an additional upcharge and not included on the base model. Mechanical keyboards tend to be on the loud side. While this is fairly quiet for a mechanical keyboard, it’s definitely a bit noisier than the average non-mechanical keyboard. If you’ll be gaming in a quiet room with someone sleeping next to you, the mechanical keyboard version of this laptop probably isn’t ideal. Otherwise, the sound is probably no big deal. This laptop’s touchpad also feels excellent with a pleasantly smooth surface and good location. I’ve used gaming laptops with larger touchpads, but the touchpad’s size was never an issue — and the compact size ensures palm rejection works well, too. I wasn’t accidentally bumping it while typing. Alienware x16 R2: Display and speakers IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman The Alienware x16 R2 has a 16-inch 2560×1600 IPS display with a 240Hz refresh rate. The display looks good, but there are some things you need to be aware of. First, this laptop’s display doesn’t have full support for . Alienware says it supports Dolby Vision videos, so that will be nice when streaming Dolby Vision-enabled content. But this is a gaming laptop, and it’s notable that the display does support . Speaking of brightness, this display is on the dim side. It offers just 300 nits of brightness. Other high-end gaming laptops — the , for example — offer 500 nits of brightness. The laptop looked good while gaming. It felt a lot brighter and looked better than the on-paper brightness numbers would lead me to expect. And that 240Hz refresh rate makes for a smooth experience. But the Alienware x16 R2 is definitely behind some of its competitors on brightness and HDR. The x16 R2’s speakers sound excellent — perhaps the best speakers I’ve ever heard in a gaming laptop. You’re getting a decent amount of bass (for a laptop.) It’s a six-speaker system with two upward-firing tweeters, one on each side of the keyboard. If you plan to do a lot of gaming with the laptop’s speakers — rather than plugging in a pair of or — you’re getting a worthwhile premium speaker setup with this laptop. Alienware x16 R2: Webcam, microphone, biometrics IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman The Alienware x16 R2 comes with a 1080p webcam with HDR. The webcam looks good — much better than the cheap 720p webcams that are often found in lower-end laptops. Also, thanks to the included with Intel’s , you get access to Windows Studio Effects — a suite of AI effects like Eye Contact that makes it look like you’re always looking at your webcam when you aren’t, as well as blurring your background and framing the video around your face. The dual-array microphones work well for built-in microphones. I still would want to use a dedicated microphone for gaming sessions — especially if you’re blasting sound from those speakers — but the microphone setup is perfectly serviceable for online meetings or for gaming in a pinch. The Alienware also comes with an . It reliably signed me into Windows with my face in a variety of different lighting conditions. It’s a great convenience feature to have, and I missed Windows Hello when I reviewed a gaming laptop without it recently. Alienware x16 R2: Connectivity IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman The Alienware x16 R2 has a rich selection of ports and great connectivity options — with the notable exception of an Ethernet port for a wired network connection, which is a popular feature on desktop-replacement laptops like this one. All the ports on this laptop are conveniently located on the back of the laptop, ensuring cables aren’t sticking out to the sides of your laptop and getting in the way. Of course, if you’re a fan of USB and headset jacks on the side of your laptop, this may not be the machine for you — but you could always plug in in a for easier access. On the back of the laptop, you’ll find a combo headphone jack, a microSD card reader slot, an HDMI 2.1 port, a Mini DisplayPort, and a power jack. You’ll also find a total of four USB ports: This machine has two USB-C ports, one of which is a Thunderbolt 4 port and one of which is a USB 3.2 Gen 2 port. There are also two USB-A ports, both of which support USB 3.2 Gen 1. When it comes to wireless networking, this laptop is as futureproof as you can get thanks to its support for and Bluetooth 5.4. You probably don’t have a Wi-Fi 7 router yet, so it’s not essential to have right now — but it means this laptop’s hardware will be ready when you upgrade your router. (Wi-Fi 7 connectivity isn’t available at launch and will be activated later in the year with a software update, according to Alienware.) There’s one big omission: This laptop doesn’t offer a built-in Ethernet jack for wired network connections. Most gaming laptops of this size offer built-in Ethernet connectivity, but of course not everyone uses it. You’ll need a if you want to connect it to your network via Ethernet — otherwise you’ll just be using Wi-Fi. Alienware x16 R2: Performance The Alienware x16 R2 delivered great performance in both gaming and day-to-day desktop use — that’s no surprise thanks to the high-end Intel Core Ultra 9 185H, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 graphics hardware, and 32GB of RAM. I enjoyed playing Cyberpunk 2077’s Phantom Liberty expansion with maxxed-out settings. The Alienware x16 R2 generates a lot of heat, but it has the cooling system to deal with it. Alienware says it has “Alienware Cryo-tech cooling technology,” and whatever it’s called, it worked well. It definitely moves a lot of hot air away from the laptop. The keyboard and other places you’d touch on the laptop stay cool enough that it’s not a problem. But benchmarks will tell the full story. As always, we ran the Alienware x16 R2 through to see how it really performs. IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman First, we run PCMark 10 to get an idea of overall system performance. While this is supposed to be an overall system performance benchmark, the CPU has a bigger impact than the GPU here. The 16-inch Alienware x16 R2 delivered a score of 7664. That’s about what we’d expect to see — with its Intel Core i9 185H CPU beats it. The Gigabyte Aorus 16X with its Intel Core i7-14650HX CPU also edges out the CPU in this Alienware laptop, but only by a little bit. Those are delivering slightly better top-end performance than Intel’s latest Meteor Lake CPUs. Meteor Lake CPUs are more focused on power efficiency and AI performance, with their integrated neural processing unit. IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman Next, we run Cinebench R20. This is a heavily multithreaded benchmark that focuses on overall CPU performance. It’s a quick benchmark, so cooling isn’t a huge factor. Since it’s multithreaded, CPUs with more cores deliver more performance and get higher scores. The Alienware x16 R2 delivered a score of 7742. That’s a few notches below the . Despite the Aorus having a “Core i7” CPU with a 7 in the model number rather than a 9, that particular CPU outperforms the Intel Core Ultra 9 in this laptop. If top-end CPU performance is what’s important to you, you’ll probably want a gaming laptop with an HX chip. However, this isn’t representative of real-world gaming performance — these CPU differences don’t necessarily make that much of a difference in games, which are much more about GPU performance. A laptop’s cooling system is also an important factor, as we’ll see below. IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman We also encode a video file with Handbrake. This is another heavily multithreaded benchmark, but it runs over an extended period of time. This demands the laptop’s cooling kick in, and many laptops will throttle and slow down under load. The Alienware x16 R2 completed our standard encode process in 728 seconds — that’s just over 12 minutes. Interestingly enough, the Alienware x16 R2 outperformed the Gigabyte Aorus x16 R2 that beat it in the Cinebench benchmark. That suggests that the Alienware x16 R2 has a better cooling system that does a better job of keeping its CPU running cool under load, even if the CPU in the Aorus does have higher top-end performance. IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman Next, we run a graphical benchmark — the most important type of benchmark for gauging gaming performance. We run 3Dmark Time Spy, a graphical benchmark that focuses on GPU performance. The results give us a look at how the different Nvidia GeForce RTX GPUs compare to each other. The Alienware x16 R2, with its Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 GPU, delivered an average score of 17089. That’s a great score — a no-expenses-spared RTX 4090 is only 22 percent faster here. The RTX 4080 is significantly faster than the RTX 4070 — and much faster than the RTX 4060 and RTX 4050. Next, we run the benchmarks in some games. First, we use the built-in benchmark in to test all the gaming laptops we review. It’s an older game, but it’s a great way to compare graphical performance across different PCs. IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman The Alienware x16 R2 ran the benchmark with an average performance of 166 frames per second. Once again, the RTX 4080 in the model we reviewed was slower than the top-of-the-line RTX 4090, but significantly faster than the RTX 4070. Finally, we run the built-in benchmark in . This is a more demanding game, and we set the benchmark to 1080p resolution at the Extreme detail setting. IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman IDG / Chris Hoffman The Alienware x16 R2 delivered an average FPS of 72. Again, that’s midway between the performance of an RTX 4070 and an RTX 4090. Overall, the Alienware x16 R2 delivered excellent performance. But this laptop is very customizable, and graphics performance will come down to which GPU you choose to put in your Alienware x16 R2 at checkout. You may be able to get more top-end CPU performance by opting for a different laptop with an HX CPU instead of a Meteor Lake Core Ultra CPU — but remember that cooling is important, too. A Core Ultra-based laptop like this one may still deliver better sustained CPU performance than an HX-based laptop that has to throttle down to stay cool, as we saw in the Handbrake encode benchmark. Alienware x16 R2: Battery life Gaming laptops aren’t known for their long battery life, but the Alienware x16 R2 has a built-in 90 Watt-hour battery. That should deliver decent life — it’s nearly the biggest battery you can get.

The Alienware x16 R2 delivered surprisingly good battery life for a 16-inch gaming laptop, running for an average of 425 minutes — that’s just over seven hours.

        "description": "Jaylen Brown embraced a leadership role this year after a key departure.",
        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS — Jaylen Brown became the longest tenured member on the Celtics roster this year after the surprise trade of Marcus Smart last June. That veteran experience showed in the locker room after Boston won their second Eastern Conference title in three years. While many of Brown’s teammates posed with trophies and reveled in the experience, Brown stayed largely reserved. It was a reflection of the mentality that Brown had tried to promote all year long for this group in the face of sharp roster changes over the summer. The Celtics All-Star led with his actions in Game 4, with a pair of clutch plays in the final minute to help secure a 105-102 win. “We had some guys leave so I wanted to make sure that void was filled,” Brown said of his leadership. “Marcus Smart, one of my brothers that got traded, he was one of the voices of our team. And when he wasn’t here I wanted to make sure I stepped in. I wanted to make sure that everybody felt me and everybody knew what the standard was. We didn’t skip no steps all season. I think we played the right way every single game. I thought everybody (was) accountable. And this is the byproduct.” The Celtics completed their first series sweep since a 2022 first round win against the Nets. Boston also improved to 6-0 on the road this postseason and 12-2 overall while becoming the first team to secure a spot in the Finals. “We feel like we’re a different team than we were last year and the year before that,” Brown said. “I know everybody wants to continue to kind of pigeonhole us to what was happening in the past but we’ve had a different team every single year, different coaches, we’ve had like three coaches in the last five years. “And still people want to make it seem like it’s the same, it’s the same, it’s the same. Time has gone by, experience has been gained and I think we are ready to put our best foot forward.” The Celtics will host Game 1 of the NBA Finals at TD Garden next Thursday night.

But this time, in Game 4 on Monday , Holiday came up big in the clutch without necessarily scoring. After Jayson Tatum’s 3-pointer went up with just seconds left in regulation, Holiday soared high into the air for the offensive rebound. After the rebound, Holiday passed the ball before getting fouled and then Jaylen Brown lobbed the ball high in the air, meaning there was no chance of a Pacers comeback. So there was Holiday, once again, making a clutch play as the Celtics secured the sweep over the Pacers and an NBA Finals berth . “Just really excited that we did this as a team and it wasn’t just one person or a couple people,” Holiday said. “We knew when (Kristaps Porzingis) went down, people would have to step up and everybody did. From Jayson (Tatum) and (Jaylen Brown) all the way down to Oshae (Brissett), who got in and played great minutes. So, great team effort. Coaching staff did great in preparing us for this whole series and making adjustments on the fly and all that. So it’s been really exciting to get this one.” Holiday was brought in to make the plays he’s shown throughout the East Finals and playoffs. The Celtics finally met some resistance in the form of clutch games this series. They had dominated the first two rounds of the playoffs, going 8-2, and only playing one close game. But they played three tight games in the East Finals — and they were just about perfect in executing their way to three tight wins. So as the Celtics head to the Finals — where they will most likely take on the Mavericks — there were also some learning lessons from the conference finals. Holiday has also turned up his play after a slow start to the playoffs, showcasing why the front office traded for him right before training camp. Holiday, who’s the lone player on the roster with a ring, can now help the C’s get to the same highs he experienced earlier in his career. “I try my best to stay faithful, stay grounded and, most importantly, have fun,” Holiday said. “If you can’t enjoy this, then I don’t know what you can’t enjoy. Not too many people get a chance to be in the Eastern Conference finals, and I know it can be a lot of pressure and a lot of buildup. But this is what we play for. This is what this is what the game is about.” More Celtics content",

In 1863, the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment, made up of freed Black men, left Boston to fight for the Union in the Civil War. In 1892, the Sierra Club was founded in San Francisco. In 1918, American troops fought their first major battle during World War I as they launched an offensive against the German-held French village of Cantigny; the Americans succeeded in capturing the village. In 1934, the Dionne quintuplets — Annette, Cecile, Emilie, Marie, and Yvonne — were born to Elzire Dionne at the family farm in Ontario, Canada. In 1937, Neville Chamberlain became prime minister of Britain. In 1940, during World War II, the Belgian army surrendered to invading German forces.

(Rust was freed by the Soviets the following year.) In 1998, comic actor Phil Hartman of “Saturday Night Live” and “NewsRadio” fame was shot to death at his home in Encino, Calif., by his wife, Brynn, who then killed herself. In 2013, calling it perhaps the biggest money-laundering scheme in US history, federal prosecutors charged seven people with running what amounted to an online, underworld bank, saying that Liberty Reserve handled $6 billion for drug dealers, child pornographers, identity thieves, and other criminals around the globe. In 2020, people torched a Minneapolis police station that the department was forced to abandon amid spreading protests over the death of George Floyd. Protesters in New York defied a coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings, clashing with police; demonstrators blocked traffic and smashed vehicles in downtown Denver before police used tear gas to disperse the crowd. At least seven people were shot as gunfire erupted during a protest in Louisville, Ky., to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a Black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March.

        "content": "Michael Jordan versus LeBron James is one of the great modern sports debates. But Kobe Bryant vs James might be even tougher to decide. James, 39, is still playing at a high level after 21 seasons and is the NBA 's all-time leading scorer. Bryant had a remarkable basketball career and even inspired tennis superstar Novak Djokovic . But the Black Mamba, who retired after 20 seasons, trails James by more than 6,000 points. Jordan got involved in the \"Who's better?\" question in 2013, when James was in his prime leading the Miami Heat 's Big Three, while Bryant was approaching the end of his legendary run with the Los Angeles Lakers . \"Kobe or LeBron?\" veteran sports analyst Ahmad Rashad asked Jordan. The question arrived for \" Michael Jordan at 50,\" a special looking back at his 50th birthday. \"I'd say, ' Kevin Durant ,' \" Jordan said. \"Naw, I'm just kidding.\" Then the 10-time scoring champion got real. \"In terms of dominance of the game of basketball, at this stage it's LeBron,\" Jordan said in 2013. But the six-time NBA Finals winner had another final answer. \"Championship-wise, it's Kobe Bryant,\" Jordan said. \"He wants it so bad and he's willing to go to the extreme. Guarding a point guard at the age of 34, playing 38 minutes, 40 minutes, that's ludicrous.\" Jordan then linked himself with Bryant, not James. \"He's cursed as much as I am,\" said Jordan, referring to Bryant. When specifically picking between Bryant and James, Air Jordan acknowledged that it would be a \"tough choice.\" Fans often side with Jordan because of his championship ring total, and he did the same in the Bryant vs. James debate. \"Five (rings) beats one,\" Jordan said. Bryant or James debate would tip toward The King in 2024, primarily because of James' longevity. But in terms of pure career dominance, many would flip the order. Jordan would be No. 1, Bryant would take No. 2 and James would be last. James, who joined the Lakers in 2018, now has four championship rings but is 4-6 all-time in the Finals. Bryant, who died in 2020, was 5-2 in the Finals. Jordan was a perfect 6-0 and led the Chicago Bulls to two three-peats. \"Interviewer: Kobe or LeBron? Jordan: Me, obviously,\" a fan jokingly tweeted. \"Reporter is lucky that MJ didnt take it personal,\" a second fan posted. \"He would give him 60 (points).\"",

        "description": "Technology stocks have led gains this year.",
        "content": "The S&P 500 index ( ^GSPC 0.70% ) roared to a record high earlier this year, confirming its presence in a bull market, but the index didn't stop there. Since then, it's continued to climb and recently hit a new record. Investors are piling into stocks on optimism about an improving economy and a steadying of interest rates -- including potential rate cuts ahead. Solid earnings reports also have buoyed sentiment. About 78% of S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter earnings announced positive earnings-per-share surprises, according to FactSet data. You'll find winning stocks in many industries, but the biggest stock market movers this year have been technology players -- especially those in the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI). They've led gains in the S&P 500 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq . Now, after the S&P's recent performance, investors are wondering what will happen next. Will the index continue to climb, or have we reached the high point of the bull market? History has some answers for us. A look back in time Let's take a stroll back in time. The S&P 500's recent bear markets took place as follows: January 2022 through October 2022 February 2020 through March 2020 October 2007 through March 2009 March 2000 through October 2002 Following each bear market, the S&P 500 had to reach a new record high to confirm that a bull market had actually started and that the gain wasn't just a bear market rally . The chart below shows the index's performance during those times and after that initial record high, and the S&P generally has gone on to hit new highs throughout the bull markets. ^SPX data by YCharts. On top of this, market data also shows us bull markets historically last longer than bear markets. In a study of the S&P 500 from 1926 through 2017, bull markets lasted an average of nearly nine years, compared to less than two years for the average bear market, according to Raymond James & Associates, citing First Trust data. Considering all of this, history tells us that the S&P 500 now could continue to climb and reach new record highs as this bull market progresses. At the same time, investor sentiment remains high, which should continue to lift stocks and the indexes. About 47% of investors are bullish on stocks today, up from 25% late last year, according to data from the American Association of Individual Investors. If history is right, gains are far from over. Does history repeat itself? The next big question is, what does this mean for you as an investor? First, it's important to keep this in mind: Though historical trends often repeat themselves, no one can guarantee this will happen on every occasion. The market could do something unexpected at any point. That said, history generally has served as a helpful guide over time. Today, it's reasonable to be optimistic about the bullish trends and get excited about the possibility of positive momentum ahead -- but you don't want to plan your investment strategy around buying and selling over a period of months to try to benefit from this. You're likely to score a much bigger win if you identify companies today that are trading at reasonable valuations and have solid prospects -- and commit to them for years. Today's bullish environment may supercharge a company's shares. However, if you've chosen a quality company, you're likely to gain even more by holding onto the stock for the long term instead of selling to lock in short-term gains. Technology companies such as AI chipmaker Nvidia or cloud computing giant Amazon offer bright prospects today because of their solid earnings track records and their presence in the growth area of AI, for example. But you'll find promising companies in other areas, too, such as healthcare or financials. It's key to build your portfolio according to your investment style, whether that's aggressive or cautious, regardless of the market environment of the time. The current market offers the opportunity to discover under-the-radar tech stocks that may come to your attention when markets favor growth. And a particular market environment may help you find bargains or get in on a player that might add a spark of growth to your portfolio. Right now, after the S&P 500's latest record, history shows us there's reason to be optimistic about the index going on to reach new highs. But the best news is, no matter what happens next, you'll benefit by finding investing opportunities today and holding on for the long term .",

        "content": "Abba have hinted at how their beloved music could finally make it to Glastonbury after decades of fans begging, wishing and wanting. The iconic Swedish quartet behind some of the world’s greatest pop songs have never played the Somerset festival , but are frequently on fans’ most-wanted list of headliners. However, the band – comprised of Agnetha Fältskog, Björn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad – have not performed together in more than 40 years, and instead have been entertaining fans with their groundbreaking Abba Voyage show in London since 2022 via their avatars in the critically-acclaimed high-tech concert. Sadly, there is no way to bring this technology to Glastonbury, but there may be a way to introduce Abba to the Pyramid Stage. Speaking at a Q&A for the second-anniversary celebration of Abba Voyage on Monday at the Abba Arena, Benny and Bjorn teased the idea of possibly making it to Glasto... sort of. Host Pete Paphides suggested that the Abba Voyage live band could go to Glastonbury, to which Bjorn excitedly replied: ‘Oh yes! ‘I think that’s a brilliant idea,’ he added, to huge cheers from the 3,000 fans in the auditorium. Benny added that ‘you’d need to ask the band,’ but seemed taken with the idea. He later joked that if the band – which plays every night at Abba Voyage alongside the avatars – did play at Glastonbury, ‘they’ll need an extra keyboard player,’ seemingly offering himself up for the job. Five years ago, Bjorn unfortunately quashed any idea of the band joining forces for Glasto. Speaking to Radio 2’s Zoe Ball Breakfast Show in 2019, when asked if there was a chance of it happening, he said: ‘Oh no, it’s a straight, straight no.’ ‘We recorded some new songs and you’ll probably hear them next year, at least one of them, but that’s quite a different thing from going through the hassle of rehearsing and – just one show, it would be the same as doing a whole year of tours,’ he said. ‘It would take 10 years out of our life.’ If the original Abba can’t make it there, at least we may get a chance to see the spectacular Abba Voyage live band, with a possible appearance from Benny on keyboards. Abba Voyage broke boundaries when it launched in May 2022 by giving fans the chance to see the Eurovision winners reimagined as modern-day pop stars. Via their incredibly lifelike avatars, and with the help of a 10-piece live band, the 95-minute concert is an extraordinary feat of technology, special visual effects and, of course, some of the greatest music of all time. Since its opening at the purpose-built Abba Arena at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London, more than two million fans have gone along to see hits such as Waterloo, SOS, Dancing Queen and Fernando being performed by the hyper-real, eternally youthful versions of Agnetha, Anni-Fri, Bjorn and Benny. Speaking at the special show on Monday, where fans asked questions alongside celebrity guests including Dame Joanna Lumley, Rosamund Pike, Dawn O’Porter, Rick Astley and Matt Lucas, Benny and Bjorn also admitted that they sometimes consider joining their avatars on stage in London. Asked by Texas frontwoman Sharleen Spiteri if they have ‘ever been tempted to secretly get on stage’, Bjorn said: ‘Yes, absolutely.’ He also admitted it is ‘hard to grasp emotionally’ the legacy they have as a band, ‘that we wrote these little songs and it gave rise to this and the millions of people we have touched. ‘We know it’s true but it’s very hard to understand. Maybe impossible.’ Benny added: ‘I’ve seen the show so many times and I think we look good up there... but I have no idea what it really is that makes people have it in them to want to listen to music that was done 50 years ago, 40 years ago, 30 years ago.’ Best festivals across UK and Europe 2024: where can you see your favourite acts? When did Abba win Eurovision and will they be performing this year? People are only just realising the meaning behind iconic 70s rock band AC/DC’s name Hit 80s band going on UK tour with a promise to play songs from all 11 albums They both agreed it was ‘preposterous’ to have imagined a show like this taking place 50 years ago at the height of their fame. Abba Voyage has now played 756 shows, and has been a critical success since it launched two years ago, with the Metro describing it as a ‘groundbreaking pop spectacle and a serotonin boost.’ However, there were recently concerns from fans that it would be leaving London for Las Vegas , but a spokesperson recently told Metro.co.uk they are ‘in conversations about the concert being in different locations at some point in the future as well as in London, but currently the only place in the world where you can see Abba Voyage is at the Abba Arena, London.’ Abba Voyage is currently booking tickets until January 2025.

        "description": "The Lake District has been revealed as the most remote luxury destinations across the UK and offers a host of amazing things to do including National Trust locations and mountain climbing",
        "content": "The Lake District has been named the best remote luxury destination in the UK. Known for its scenic landscapes filled with mountains and lakes, the Lake District in Cumbria offers the best remote luxury destination in Great Britain. With a population of just over 40,000 across the entire area, this National Park is for adventure-goers who wish to seek out the natural British landscape. There are over 32 highly rated walks over woods and waters to discover and 23 National Trust locations to see including Grasmere, Fell Foot and Wray Castle. The Lake District also has more than 16 lakes, and features a stretch of coastline. Each lake has a wealth of activities on offer including boat hire, kayaking, fishing and even lake ecology lessons. For those who like to stargaze, locations such as Ennerdale, Wasdale, Grizedale Forest, Borrowdale Valley and The Langdale Valley, all offer great spots. The third longest lake in the district, Coniston Water, sits below the mountain of the Old Man of Coniston and is approximately half a mile from the village. Coniston Boating Centre offers boat and bike hire, and the village offers a range of guest houses, B&Bs, holiday cottages and pubs. There is even a rebuilt Victorian Steam Yacht Gondola ran by The National Trust which journeys through the Coniston Fells. Lake District secured the top spot, known for its scenic landscapes and lakes ( Image: Getty Images) Climbers can enjoy the highest point in England, Scafell Pike, which stands at 978m. A hike to the peak is not for the light-hearted, but does offer incredible views across the National Park, once at the summit. For those who aren't fond of hiking or cycling, there are multiple tours across the district via mini tour buses. One specific tour travels to Windermere for a half-day Beatrix Potter tour and experience. The town was home to the popular children's author in the early 1900s, and her cottage has been left as she would have known it. The tour also visits the nearby village of Hawkshead, where poet William Wordsworth attended school. The National Park is also home to The Lakes Distillery , which produces gin, whiskey and vodka using local produce. Having opened in 2014, it is fast becoming a favourite attraction in Cumbria. Tours and tastings run daily and at the weekend you can also visit their resident alpacas. Like quirky things? Then head to the Derwent Pencil Museum. While being home to one of the more mundane objects in life but one we all use at some point, the building sits in the shadow of the old Cumberland Pencils factory and is home the world's very first pencil! The museum also houses spy pencils from World War Two and an 8m colouring pencil — after visiting, you will definitely have a newfound love and appreciation of pencils. When it comes to accommodation, it depends on where you stay in the district. One particularly special place to stay is The Tranquil Otter , which offers an array of log cabins that featured private hot tubs overlooking a nature reserve. The Lake District featured as the number one remote luxury destination on Land Rover Defender's 'Defender Destination Index' . Results were found by analysing the number of five-star hotels, Michelin Guide restaurants, five-star golf clubs, exceptional spa and wellness centres, excellent hiking trails and National Trust locations in each area.

        "content": "MUMBAI: After wielding dominance in every field they touch, the Adani group is all set to venture into e-commerce, UPI payments and credit card business. Financial Times reports that Adani is preparing to apply for a license to operate on Unified Payments Interface (UPI), India's widely used public digital payment network. Adani Group is gearing up to take on digital payments giants Google Pay and Mukesh Ambani's Jio Pay with its foray into new business. The company is also in talks with banks, interested in offering credit card services in collaboration with Adani. According to the emerging report, the company is also negotiating talks to offer online shopping through the Open Network for Digital Commerce; an e-commerce network expanding in the country also backed by the government. India's digital public infrastructure stack, which includes ONDC and UPI, is popular with aspiring consumer technology startups and is attracting millions of customers every month. Adani's new business venture, if approved, will be known as 'Adani One'. In 2022, the company has launched an application called 'Adani One'. The app currently offers travel-related services including hotel and flight reservations. The company's e-commerce and payment apps will be initially exclusive to its existing customers. The company is highly hopeful about engaging more than a million customers through ‘Adani One’; mostly people in airports, and others who do transactions of gas and electricity bills. Users of Adani One's services can earn loyalty points through bill payments or duty-free purchases and use them for online shopping. However, the Adani group didn’t comment on the news of their new venture. The business world has fixated eyes on Adani to see how the magnate will fare in the sprawling UPI arena. Gautam Adani is currently the second richest man in Asia.",

The group’s parent company has ordered an investigation into the handling of staff complaints after feedback was received from staff about how they were treated. A spokesman for the company said they took complaints of harassment, including sexual harassment, very seriously and they had a zero-tolerance policy for matters of this nature. “It is critically important to us that our workplace is one where all team members feel safe, valued and included,” the spokesman said. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. “We sincerely thank team members for speaking up and raising their concerns.” The company’s chief executive Roy Bagattini has since sent an email to staff after the investigation was reported in the media. “You are no doubt aware that some of our team members have pre-emptively engaged with the media and this has resulted in various speculative news reports,” he said to staff. “The external attention on our company, through these news articles, can be unsettling and comes at a difficult time for yourselves but also for us as a company.” The investigation is expected to wrap up in June.",

        "content": "Edinburgh's Low Emission Zone , which comes into force on Saturday, June 1, will mean only vehicles which meet strict emissions standards will be allowed to enter a 1.2 square mile area of the city centre. Vehicles which do not comply with the standards will be excluded and will have to find another route to reach their destination. The ban operates 24/7 all year round and fines start at £60 - halved to £30 if paid within 30 days - but can go up to £480 for repeat offences.

Edinburgh Low Emission Zone: All you need to know about Capital's ban on worst-polluting vehicles The LEZ requirements are based on Euro exhaust emission standards. Petrol cars and vans must meet Euro 4 standards, which means most petrol cars and vans registered before January 2006 will be subject to the ban. Diesel cars and vans must meet Euro 6 standards, meaning that most of these kinds of vehicles registered before September 2015 will be excluded. But drivers are advised to check their individual vehicles on the online checker because some makes and models do comply with the requirements even though they are several years older. Advertisement Advertisement Petrol and diesel taxis and private hire vehicles must also meet Euro 6 standards. And buses, coaches and HGVs are required to comply with Euro VI standards. Motorcycles and mopeds are not affected. And there is a national list of exemptions, included in the legislation, which means some vehicles will be allowed into the LEZ, whether they meet the standards or not. These include emergency vehicles; vehicles for people with disabilities, including people who have blue badges; military vehicles; historic vehicles; and showman's vehicles. The council can also grant local temporary (‘time-limited’) exemptions for a vehicle or type of vehicle for up to 12 months, but it has said it will only do this on a case-by-case basis and in exceptional circumstances.",

        "content": "When you're in a car park and it's almost full, you may start to panic because you're too nervous to reverse your car into a spot. However, there's no reason to break into a sweat because it's much easier than you think, and TikToker @tonggeshuoche has shared an invaluable tip to help drivers who panic when faced with the prospect of reverse parking. He captioned the video: \" Parking skills that 1 billion people don't know, taught in 15 seconds!\" He said: \"First of all, we drove the car parallel to the parking space line. When our rear view mirror is aligned with the parking space line next to it, turn the steering wheel full to the left. Keep going. 'My neighbour's kids constantly scream and fight in their garden – it's unbearable' \"Let's look at the rear view mirror on the right. When you can see the corner of the target parking space from the rear view mirror, turn the steering wheel full to the right. \"Shift into reverse gear and reverse the car. When our car is parallel to the two cars next to us, straighten the steering wheel. Reverse the car. I parked my car and got into my seat very smoothly.\" In the comments, some said they should just \"park forwards\" if they can't reverse park. Someone else said: \"Looks so easy but it's definitely not.\" Another joked: \"Maybe after 10 years I will learn this.\" And a fourth wrote: \"I can't still. Baby steps for me I guess.\" Another TikToker suggested: \"It's better to make the reverse turn too wide vs too narrow. If your turn is too wide it's very easy to correct by going forward once more. Too tight and you have to start all over.\" Someone else said: \"Or just don't park near supermarket entrances where most people park. I park further away to more parking spaces to choose from!\" And a final person suggested drivers might struggle in the UK more, writing: \"But in UK the spaces are so tight for back parking.\" Do you have a story to share?

        "content": "An American living in the UK has called out Brits for our hilarious phone etiquette - but we stand by it. On the surface, the US and the UK are not too dissimilar. Yes, they say candy instead of sweets, don't know how to make a proper brew - and think everyone is friends with the royal family . But, aside from that, we're quite alike. One big difference is our perpetual desire to never come across as rude: we'll queue for hours, say please and thanks a million times when grabbing a coffee, and say sorry when we've done nothing wrong. However, one TikTok star who has come from across the pond has garnered hundreds of thousands of views after pointing out how awkward Brits are on the phone, and to be fair, he has a point (not that we'll ever change our ways)... American man tries Tesco meal deal for first time and Brits cry at his Monster Munch reaction In a recent video, user Post Christianity said: \"One of the big differences I've noticed about British culture is the strange thing they do whenever it's time to say goodbye after a phone call. I first heard this one when my wife was having a chat with her sister and they both go 'bye bye bye bye bye' to each other at the same time. It's almost like this flock of birds doing a mating call - 'bye bye bye bye'.\" The user added that in America, most people - especially men - will end a phone call much more succinctly by saying 'alright, late'. But even when he had to call the council about tax in the UK, the employee ended the call by repeatedly saying 'bye bye'. Want to avoid the doom and gloom? Get the latest positive news sent straight to your inbox with our Bright Stuff newsletter More than a thousand Brits rushed to the comments section to defend their polite phone call etiquette - with many admitting they'd feel bad for ending a conversation so abruptly. \"If someone just said bye once and hung up I'd have to ring them back and ask them why they were mad at me,\" one person said. Another agreed, commenting: \"Saying bye just once means you're angry with someone.\" A third added: \"We're so awkward when it comes to ending a phone call or conversation in general.\" While a fourth joked: \"Cheers, bye, alright, cheers, thanks, bye.\" Do you have a story to share?

        "content": "Watch live as Rishi Sunak continues his general election campaign in the West Midlands on Tuesday, 28 May, after announcing a £2.4 billion tax break to help secure the support of pensioners as he battles to remain in No 10. The prime minister has pledged a “triple lock plus” to increase the income tax personal allowance for pensioners, giving them a tax cut worth around £95 in 2025-26, rising to £275 in 2029-30. Mr Sunak is offering to protect the triple lock on the state pension brought in by Lord Cameron in 2010 which means that it is guaranteed to go up by the highest rate of inflation or 2.5 per cent, whichever is the largest increase. On Tuesday, Mr Sunak will also announce that from April next year the income tax personal allowance for pensioners will be increased in line with the triple lock. The new tax policy will cost £2.4bn a year by 2029/30 and will be funded through clamping down on tax dodgers – the same pot of money which will help pay for Mr Sunak’s plan for new mandatory national service for 18-year-olds. National service plans were the PM’s first major policy proposal since he announced the general election in the pouring rain last week. The policy would see see 18-year-olds forced to either sign up to the military or cyber defence force or undertake community volunteering work. Mr Sunak has defended the plans, saying they would “foster a culture of service which is going to be incredibly powerful for making our society more cohesive.”",

(Image from the company webpage) VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 28, 2024 (Korea Bizwire) – Bedford Metals Corp. (TSX-V: BFM) (the “Company” or “Bedford”) is pleased to announce its proposed multi-phase work program for its Ubiquity Lake Uranium Project , situated on the lip of the Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan. Phase 1 of the program calls for an airborne VTEM (Time Domain Electromagnetic) survey of the project, aimed at further identifying subsurface features such as faults and folds, which may be controls of historic radioactive anomalies. Concurrently, an airborne radiometric survey will be conducted to provide additional insights into the project’s geology. Phase 2 will implement a comprehensive ground program that includes field mapping, soil sampling, and a systematic ground radiometric survey to identify new and historic anomalies. Shaw drills will be utilized in this phase. Additionally, selected features identified through prospecting and interpretation of airborne survey data will undergo further examination with a ground IP (Induced Polarization) survey to refine targets for diamond drilling. Peter Born, President of Bedford commented “We appreciate the effort by the team in designing this comprehensive exploration program for our Ubiquity Lake Uranium Project. We are excited about the potential of this project and look forward to advancing it through the proposed work program.” Bedford remains committed to conducting all exploration work to the highest environmental standards and in collaboration with local communities and indigenous nations. Environmental stewardship is a core value of the company, and it will continue to prioritize responsible resource development. As the exploration program progresses, Bedford will keep stakeholders informed with regular updates on its website and through other communication channels. About Bedford Metals Corp . Bedford Metals Corp. is a mineral exploration company. We create value for our shareholders by identifying and developing highly prospective mineral exploration opportunities. Our strategy is to advance our projects from discovery to production, allowing Bedford to achieve significant shareholder value through the entire mining life cycle. Close Lake Uranium Project lies on the eastern side of the Athabasca Basin, adjoining claims held by Cameco Corporation, the largest uranium producer in the world. The claim is approximately 245 hectares and lies within the primary exploration corridor, which hosts the Keys Lake mine, the Cigar Lake Mine and the McArthur River Mine. The property can be accessed through a network of roads and trails. Ubiquity Lake Uranium Project , covering 1382 hectares, lies just south of the bottom lip of the Athabasca Basin, adjacent to ALX Uranium’s Carpenter Lake Project to the east. Situated near the Cable Bay Shear Zone, parallel to the Virgin River Shear Zone, which hosts Cameco’s Centennial uranium deposit, the project holds immense potential. Furthermore, it is located 100 km west of Cameco’s past-producing Key Lake uranium mine, underscoring the strategic significance of its location.

        "content": "Thirty-six days ago, prosecutors with the Manhattan district attorney's office set out to convince a jury of twelve New Yorkers that broke the law by hiding damaging information from voters. During closing arguments Tuesday, they'll attempt to convince that jury to convict the former president on 34 felony counts -- a historic decision in what could be the only one of Trump's criminal cases that reaches a verdict before the 2024 election. Prosecutors built their case across four weeks of testimony, calling 20 witnesses including Stormy Daniels, the adult film actress whose hush money payment sits at the center of the case; Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer who made the payment to Daniels just days ahead of the 2016 election; and multiple Trump Organization employees who helped orchestrate Cohen's alleged reimbursement in 2017. With the burden on prosecutors to prove the case, Trump's lawyers put on a brief defense case -- calling just two witnesses -- and sought to discredit key witnesses like Cohen and Daniels. Some of the key events at the center of the case -- that Daniels was paid $130,000 for her silence and that Cohen was paid $420,000 by Trump in 2017 -- are undisputed by defense lawyers. As a result, the closing arguments are likely to focus on Trump's awareness of Cohen's conduct, and Trump's motivations for allegedly approving the payments. Prosecutors argue that Trump approved Daniels' hush money payment to influence the election, while defense lawyers pin the arrangement on Cohen and say Trump was simply trying to protect his family. Defense lawyers attempted to cast Cohen's alleged reimbursement after the election as legitimate payments processed by accountants at the Trump Organization, but prosecutors say the payments were disguised to hide their true purpose from voters. The jury -- comprised of seven men and five women including two lawyers, a schoolteacher, and a physical therapist -- are expected to begin deliberating on Wednesday morning after Judge Juan Merchan instructs them on the law related to the case. The state's case centers around what they argue was a pressing concern for Trump as he announced his candidacy in the 2016 election. \"There's going to be a lot of women coming forward,\" Cohen testified Trump warned him at the start of the campaign. As the campaign gained momentum, prosecutors say Trump engaged in a criminal conspiracy that began with an August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower. Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified that during a meeting with Trump and Cohen, he agreed to help the Trump campaign by running positive stories about Trump, pushing negative stories about his opponents, and acting as the campaign's \"eyes and ears\" by flagging negative stories about Trump related to women. \"If hear anything about women selling stories ... I would notify Michael Cohen and then he would be able to have them killed in another magazine or have them not be published or somebody would have to purchase them,\" Pecker testified. Acting on his agreement with Trump and Cohen, Pecker said that his company paid for two stories, including a $30,000 payment to a former doorman who falsely alleged that Trump had an illegitimate child, and a $150,000 payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal who alleged a months-long affair with Trump, which Trump has steadfastly denied. Pecker told jurors that he had already spent too much on those agreements when he got word in October 2016 that Daniels was selling her story of an alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump that Trump has denied. Pecker testified that he flagged the story to Cohen, who told jurors that he brought the matter directly to Trump. \"This is really a disaster. Women will hate me. Guys may think it's cool, but this is going to be a disaster for the campaign,\" Cohen testified about Trump's reaction to the story. Prosecutors called Daniels to the witness stand to describe her alleged sexual encounter with Trump, offering details that prosecutors said were necessary for the jury to understand Trump's motivation to kill the story. \"I told very few people that we had actually had sex because I felt ashamed that I didn't stop it, that I didn't say no,\" Daniels told jurors. The possibility of Daniels' allegations becoming public came as Trump's campaign was in crisis mode after the release of the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which prompted some prominent Republicans to withdraw their support for Trump and the Republican National Committee to consider finding a new candidate to replace him, former Trump aide and one-time RNC staffer Madeleine Westerhout testified. Cohen told jurors that he spoke with Trump about the Daniels matter more than 20 times in October 2016. According to Cohen, Trump authorized him to make a $130,000 payment to Daniels pursuant to a nondisclosure agreement, effectively killing the story just days before the 2016 election. Cohen also said that in January 2017, he attended a meeting with Trump and former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg where they agreed on a plan to reimburse Cohen for the Daniels payment and the taxes he would owe on the reimbursement -- as well as his bonus and another expense reimbursement -- through twelve $35,000 payments. Jurors saw each of the invoices submitted by Cohen for legal services pursuant to a retainer agreement, as well as the internal vouchers generated by the Trump Organization to pay Cohen, and the checks signed by Trump and the representatives of his trust. Prosecutors allege that the business records were falsified to disguise the reimbursement for Cohen's payment to Daniels, further hiding the existence of the hush money payment from the public. Defense lawyers have sought to distance Trump from the allegedly falsified documents and limit the suggestion that the former president acted with fraudulent intent -- beginning with discrediting the prosecution's star witness Michael Cohen. \"He has a goal, an obsession with getting Trump, and you're going to hear that,\" defense lawyer Todd Blanche said during his opening statement. \"I submit to you that he cannot be trusted.\" Across three days of cross-examination, defense lawyers painted Cohen as a spiteful employee intent on revenge by highlighting his criminal history, past lies under oath, and animosity toward Trump. Cohen also admitted to stealing $30,000 from the Trump Organization by overcharging the company for an IT expense, and defense lawyers say he lied on the witness stand about an October 2016 phone call that he said he made to confirm with Trump the plan to pay Daniels $130,000. Defense lawyers also attempted to distance Trump from the creation of the allegedly falsified documents, arguing that the payments were orchestrated by accountants within the Trump Organization after receiving invoices from Cohen. For the nine checks that bear Trump's signature, defense lawyers elicited testimony from Westerhout saying that Trump, at times, signed checks without examining them. Another former White House aide, communications director Hope Hicks, offered testimony to support the defense's argument that the nondisclosure agreement with Daniels was prompted by Trump's desire to protect his family -- and not done to influence the election. \"I don't think he wanted anyone in his family to be hurt or embarrassed by anything that was happening on the campaign,\" Hicks said. \"He wanted them to be proud of him.\"",

        "content": "NEW DELHI: In yet another sharp retort to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent statement of feeling \"sent by God,\" Congress leader Rahul Gandhi mocked the PM and said, \"God sent Modi to help Adani and not the poor.\" He also asserted that the INDIA bloc will \"jumpstart\" the country's economy once it assumes power at the Centre. Gandhi's reaction came in response to PM Modi's remark made during an interview, where he expressed a belief in being divinely ordained rather than biologically born. Earlier, the Congress leader suggested that if the Enforcement Directorate (ED) were to question PM Modi about corruption post-elections, he might attribute his actions to divine intervention. \"Why is PM Modi weaving tales of divine intervention now? Because when the ED questions him about Adani after the elections, he may claim it was ordained by the Almighty,\" Gandhi quipped, urging Modi to focus on addressing pressing issues like unemployment instead of delivering lengthy speeches that foster division. Challenging the Prime Minister to be transparent about his government 's performance in job creation, Gandhi emphasized the need for practical solutions to tackle the nation's challenges. Furthermore, Gandhi outlined the INDIA bloc's commitment saying INDI alliance government will end the 50 per cent cap on reservation while asserting that the alliance will protect the Constitution with \"dil, jaan aur khoon\". Addressing an election rally in Uttar Pradesh's Bansgaon with Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, Gandhi said, \"There is INDIA bloc and the Constitution on one side and those who want to finish the Constitution on the other.\" The INDIA bloc will protect the Constitution with \"dil, jaan aur khoon (heart, life and blood)\", he said and added that the alliance will end the 50 per cent cap on reservation while also increasing it. On Agnipath , Gandhi said the INDIA bloc, once it assumes power, will tear apart the scheme and throw it in the dustbin. The government rolled out the Agnipath recruitment scheme in June 2022 for short-term induction of personnel with an aim to bring down the age profile of the three armed services. It provides for recruiting youngsters between the age bracket of 17-and-half years and 21 for four years with a provision to retain 25 per cent of them for 15 more years.",

        "content": "VMPL Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], May 28: Kotak General Insurance, an insurance provider in India spots growth in electric vehicle insurance due to increasing adoption of electric vehicles in India. The rise in electric vehicle (EV) adoption is not only reshaping the motor landscape but also revolutionising the insurance sector. Electric vehicles have become a symbol of innovation and progress in the Indian motor industry with a focus on sustainability and reduced carbon emissions. The recent growth in electric vehicle insurance serves as a testimony to the rapid expansion of the EV market in India. A significant spike in the number of electric vehicles on Indian roads has been spotted which helps in increasing environmental awareness and advancements in EV technology. This spike in the adoption of electric vehicles has encouraged a parallel demand for insurance for electric vehicles in the minds of vehicle owners. Electric vehicles offer various benefits such as lower fuel costs and reduced environmental impact. Electric vehicles might have features like advanced battery technology and electronic systems which might require potential insurance coverage to mitigate the risks and liabilities in the future. One of the key factors driving the growth of electric vehicle insurance is the proactive approach to developing innovative products and services to the evolving needs of electric vehicle owners.

        "description": "\"As long as my team knows my value, my city knows my value, my family. And that's all I really care about.” The post Jaylen Brown channels criticism into motivation en route to conference finals MVP honors appeared first on Boston.com.",
        "content": "By Jaylen Brown didn’t mince words on Monday night when asked about his new hardware. “I wasn’t expecting that at all. I don’t ever win [expletive],” Brown said “So, I was just happy that we won.” Brown won the voting for the trophy by a slim 5-4 margin over his teammate Jayson Tatum, but he left his fingerprints all over Boston’s four-game sweep against the Pacers. Over those four games, the 27-year-old wing averaged 29.8 points to go with five rebounds, three assists, and two steals per game. He delivered the before triumph at TD Garden. In Boston’s Game 4 clincher on Monday at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, Brown led the charge with 29 points, six rebounds, and three steals. “I was playing like trash in the first half — the pace was really getting to me. I feel like I was a step behind,” Brown said of his start, with the forward only sinking one of his first seven shots. “And then I just needed to be a little more patient in the second half and let the game kind of come to me a little bit more. And I did that. I was just trying to get to the basket and use my physicality. “But if the game tells you to shoot a jump shot, you got to shoot a jump shot. And so in the second half, I think I made three [3-pointers], let the jumper fly a little bit more. And that opens some stuff up for me. So sometimes, you just got to be flexible, you got to be versatile. And just the game will tell you what you need to do.” But beyond his scoring output, Brown made an impact on the defensive side of the ball in Game 4 – blocking what would have been a go-ahead basket for Indiana’s Andrew Nembhard with just 1:05 left on the clock. Jaylen Brown in the final 3 minutes to send the Celtics to the NBA Finals: -Hit a step through to tie the game -Blocked Nembhard at the rim -Attacked paint, found White for go-ahead 3 29 points, 6 rebounds, 3 steals, 2 assists, 1 block in 44 minutes. A complete game by Brown. On the following possession, Brown drove with the ball before dishing it out to Derrick White for the series-clinching 3-pointer. While Brown took the high road after Game 2 , he did take issue for not making any NBA All-Defensive Teams despite making strides in that area of the game. “I think I’m one of the best two-way wings, guards, whatever you want to say, in this game,” Brown said. “I thought this year I’ve taken a level and I’ve increased it. I took the matchup, I picked up guys full-court, I chase guys off screens, I battle with bigs. I felt like I should have been All-Defensive. “And that probably hurt me the most because that’s one of the things that I set out in the season that I wanted to be. But as time has gone by and I got to this point, like I just stopped caring. I just embraced — I don’t care who sees what, as long as my team knows my value, my city knows my value, my family. And that’s all I really care about.” Brown put together another strong campaign in 2023-24 as Boston’s No. 2 scoring option behind Tatum — averaging 23 points, 5.5 rebounds, 3.6 assists, and 1.2 steals per game while shooting 49.9% from the field. That production on the court hasn’t always translated to heaps of individual accolades handed Brown’s way. But at this stage of his career, Brown is focused more on the collective goal that is now within reach with the Celtics — with just four wins separating Boston from an 18th championship. “You just embrace it. At this point, I’m at that phase in my life where I just embrace all forms of negativity or whatever the case is,” Brown said. “Some stuff I don’t understand — it ain’t meant for me to understand it, but I just know who I am. And what I stand for. Sometimes it makes people feel uncomfortable. And sometimes I miss out on things — I miss out on opportunities, awards, marketing deals, or whatever the case may be. “And at this point, I just embrace it. I am who I am. And I’m gonna stand on my beliefs. And I’m one of those people who would die for what they believe in. So I just embraced it at this point. And I’m grateful that I’m able to be in this position and the energy’s about to shift.” Get breaking news and analysis delivered to your inbox during basketball season. Be civil. Be kind.",

        "content": "Writing on his (28 May), journalist Vinny O’Connor reports that the Toffees are “looking at taking” the England international to Goodison Park. The central midfielder spent the second half of last season at West Ham but struggled massively and has now returned to the Etihad Stadium, but is expected to leave this summer. Everton will need to improve their squad ahead of the 2024/25 season having been in another relegation battle, and Phillips could certainly add something to the squad. Phillips is very capable of playing at the base of a midfield with some excellent defensive attributes, but he is also incredibly comfortable on the ball and is not afraid of some hard work. So it would make sense that Dyche is interested in a player like that, and with at the club this summer it would open up a spot in the squad for Philips to come in. Everton looking at taking Kalvin Phillips on loan....more on His performances at West Ham were poor but after barely playing for 18 months while at Man City it’s understandable that he needs some rhythm in his game. His quality is clear for all to see and a loan deal would be a great way of saving what little budget the club has for other areas of the pitch too. This is one to keep an eye on, for sure.

        "description": "A three year programme of cultural activity focused on the mill race area of Lancaster has come full circle.",
        "content": "The Mill Race: Flow of Change programme was launched in 2021 with an event in the car park next to the city’s historic Grand Theatre and three years later, the theatre has hosted its finale celebration. The programme, overseen by Lancaster Arts, has coincided with redevelopment work in the High Street Heritage Action Zone (HSHAZ) led by Lancaster City Council and primarily funded by Historic England.

Since its launch, Flow of Change has animated an area badly affected in 2015 by Storm Desmond and the flooding of the mill race which runs underneath much of the north-east of the city centre around North Road, Lower Church Street and St Leonardsgate. “We have this extraordinary underground river that runs through the city and has been so important in the development of Lancaster yet it is invisible,” said Lancaster Arts director, Jocelyn Cunningham. The aim of the cultural activity was to make the ‘invisible’ mill race visible by raising its profile through more than 40 events including choral and dance performances, films, exhibitions, talks, storytelling and guided walks. For the first time, the Light Up Lancaster festival used the mill race area as a location for installations which included Butterfly Dream and On The Curled Clouds in St John’s Church which re-opened its doors after being badly damaged in Storm Desmond. Advertisement Advertisement More than 14,500 engaged with the cultural programme including pupils from Dallas Road School and staff from Standfast & Barracks whose building in Caton Road suffered from the 2015 floods. Many of those involved joined the Celebrating the Mill Race event at the Grand Theatre whose exterior has seen a major refurbishment as part of the HSHAZ programme which will be completed in July when work to widen the pavement outside takes place. New murals depicting the past, present and future of the area, are the final part of the cultural programme and can be seen above 137a St Leonardsgate and on the former dance studio in St Leonard’s Place at the back of the Grand. “One of the most wonderful things about working with Jocelyn and the team at Lancaster Arts has been the shared ambition and joy in seeing people become more passionate about this part of their city,” said Lancaster City Council’s regeneration officer, Kate Smith.

A Népjóléti Bizottság áprilisi ülésén Takács Péter elmondta: a beszerzett lélegeztetőgépek különböző tudásszintűek. Vannak olyanok, amelyek az intenzív osztályos igénybevételnek, illetve az ottani elvárásoknak megfelelnek. – magyarázta az államtitkár, hozzátéve, hogy a gépek egy része kisebb tudásszintű, ezek non-invazív légzéstámogatásra alkalmas berendezések, amelyekre külön terve van a kormánynak. – mondta az államtitkár, aki szerint a kutatóintézet bevonásával a lélegeztetőgépek jelentős részét jó eséllyel át tudják alakítani az alvási apnoés betegek támogatására.

Takács Péter a lélegeztetőgép-beszerzéssel kapcsolatban elmondta: Az egészségügyi államtitkár reagált Szabó Tímea azon kritikájára is, hogy a kormánytagok VIP-ellátást kapnak, miközben milliók nem férnek hozzá az ellátásokhoz.
