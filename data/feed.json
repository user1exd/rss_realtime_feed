Orban also stressed that Europe cannot afford to fund both its own defense and Ukraine’s war effort, a stance that puts him at odds with the 26 other EU leaders who insist that Ukraine must be part of any negotiations regarding its future.#viktororban #putin #trump #ukraine #war",

Unlike the early-career phase, which focuses on learning and exploration, mid-career is about leadership, adaptability, and strategic decision-making. Whether you're seeking growth, stability, or a career shift, understanding key lessons can help you make informed decisions. Here are five crucial career insights for navigating this stage effectively. 1. Focus on skills, not titles Chasing titles and promotions alone won’t guarantee long-term success. Companies value professionals who can adapt, solve problems, and deliver results over those with impressive designations but stagnant skill sets. Staying updated with industry trends and upskilling will create more opportunities than a title change. Continuous learning is the key to staying relevant in an evolving job market. 2. Networking drives career growth At mid-career, your professional network can open more doors than job applications. Building and maintaining strong connections can lead to new opportunities, mentorship, and industry insights. Even if you’re not actively job-hunting, staying engaged in professional circles can help you discover opportunities you wouldn’t have otherwise considered. 3. Adaptability ensures career longevity The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of adaptability. Professionals who embraced new technologies, industry shifts, and workplace changes remained valuable assets. Being...",

More than a few are new faces to the international community and have little, or even no, experience with China-related affairs. The choices are wild cards in a high-stakes strategic competition between world's two largest economies, which are also the top two defence spenders.

Luke Humphries and Rob Cross hit nine-darters on night five of the Premier League in Brighton, but both players finished up on the losing side in their respective matches. Humphries was the first to add his name to the illustrious list of players who have hit a nine-darter in the Premier League, with Cross the man on the receiving end. Voltage kept his cool and fought back to defeat Humphries before emulating the world No.1 during his semi-final clash against Nathan Aspinall later in the night. It was a bittersweet experience for both players, considering they went on to lose, but if it was up to former player-turned-pundit Part, the duo would’ve been given an automatic win after completing the nine-dart finish. Speaking as part of the Sky Sports commentary team, the Canadian floated the rule change, claiming players who hit a nine-darter should be crowned victor regardless of whatever state the game was in. Wayne Mardle, who was alongside Part on the microphone, was having none of it, with the 51-year-old laughing off his counterpart’s suggestion. Part did concede that it would likely only work for best-of-11 matches, and in the World Championship, where the format is a little different, the reward should be an automatic set win instead.

The guidelines, which covered both China and Iran, stated that \"official counterparts (parliamentarians) will not be invited to visit the European Parliament\" and that there would be no \"official missions\" to the countries while sanctions remain in place, \"unless the mission includes at least one member\" who has been sanctioned.

Recently a clip from the same episode with Ashish Chanchlani , Ranveer Allahbadia and Apoorva Mukhija, has been going viral where Samay Raina asked a handicapped contestant about whether it is right to roast them or not on the show. Samay asked, 'When a divyang comes to our show, should we make fun of them or should we not. Because I believe we should treat them equally.' The contestant who was sitting in the wheelchair replied, 'Dekho, agar woh aapke show pe aa raha hai, I feel they know what they are coming for.

        "content": "In today’s dynamic digitalisation, Instagram has become one of the most powerful tools for personal branding, business growth, and creatively expressing yourself online. With over a billion active users worldwide, it offers an opportunity to connect and engage with a varied audience. The platform caters to all people across all walks of life, whether you are an aspiring influencer, a small business owner, or simply someone who enjoys sharing moments from your life, growing your Instagram following can significantly enhance your reach and impact. Yet, the path to creating a sincere and dedicated audience is not easy. The Instagram algorithm prioritises content that interacts with people, and it can appear to be mysterious at times. Creating this engaging content also requires an aesthetic nature for the platform and an acute sense of beauty, imagination, and honesty. Though some take a shortcut in terms of purchasing followers or relying on automated tools, these measures typically fail, leading to an empty and inactive following. The real secret of a successful Instagram account is its capacity to create meaningful connections and genuine interactions. It's all about building a community where the followers feel appreciated and motivated through the content. This process takes a mixture of strategic thinking, hard work, and an intimate knowledge of the followers' interests and tastes. It is also essential to remember that growing one’s Instagram following is a marathon, not...",

The Delhi Jal Board (DJB) said that it has taken note of the complaints, and is working to identify the point where the potable water pipeline may have been contaminated. Maharani Bagh RWA president Shiva Mehra said that around three days ago, residents started noticing a foul smell in their water supply, and so far, around 15 blocks have been affected. “The issue was escalated to DJB, and their officials have visited the colony multiple times, but no solution has been found so far,” he said, adding that, in the meantime, residents have been forced to order water tankers. Mehra said that the drainage infrastructure has been weakened by years of neglect and lack of maintenance, which perhaps has led to the mixing of effluents from sewage lines with clean water supply lines. “We have advised residents to clean their tanks, use mineral water for drinking purposes and washing utensils purposes while using tanker water for other purposes,” he said.

Their meeting took place on Thursday, it said. Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that Russia has agreed to assist U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration in communicating with Iran on various issues, including on Tehran's nuclear programme and its support for regional anti-U.S. proxies. The Kremlin said on Wednesday that future talks between Russia and the United States would include discussions on Iran's nuclear programme, a subject it said had been \"touched upon\" in an initial round of U.S.-Russia talks last month. Trump last month restored his \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Iran which includes efforts to drive its oil exports down to zero in order to stop Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran denies any such intention. Russia has deepened its ties with the Islamic Republic since the start of the Ukraine war, and signed a strategic cooperation treaty with Iran in January.

Rijiju also dismissed the opposition clamour for Modi's visit to Manipur. \"What do you mean by the prime minister visiting a place where there is a problem?

This is the only prime minister who has gone to the root to ensure that the problem that is faced by the people of Manipur will be settled and solved forever,\" the minister said.

After Scheffler clinched the 2024 Masters trophy, finishing ahead of Aberg by four shots, the Swedish talent was nothing but complimentary. \"Someone asked me who's my favourite golfer on tour, and I said Scottie,\" Aberg said. \"Not only because of the way he plays, but the person he is.\" This adulation from Aberg, who narrowly missed out at the Masters, underscores the respect between these two competitors. Scheffler returned the compliment after bagging his second major championship last April. Reflecting on his relationship with Aberg, Scheffler explained: \"I hadn't played much golf with him, I had heard about him, and he had been playing some really good golf last summer but I had never been paired with him.\" During a press conference, the 28-year-old described Aberg as a \"really nice guy\" and also pointed out his \"very competitive\" nature. \"I think we met at one of the dinners one night, we ended up sitting next to each other.

Speaking at his annual press conference, Wang emphasised that specific differences, including boundary issues, should not overshadow bilateral ties. “Over the past year, China-India relations have progressed positively,” Wang said, attributing it to the successful meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping in Kazan, Russia. He was responding to a question on Beijing’s view of bilateral ties following the resolution of the prolonged stalemate. At the Kazan meeting, Xi and Modi provided strategic direction for improving bilateral ties, Wang said on the sidelines of China's ongoing parliamentary session. Following this, both nations actively implemented the leaders' shared understanding, enhancing exchanges and practical cooperation across various levels, resulting in significant progress, he added. India and China concluded the disengagement process late last year after finalising an agreement to withdraw troops from Depsang and Demchok, the last remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh, marking the end of a four-year-long deadlock in relations. Following the finalisation of the pact, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held talks in Kazan on October 23, where both sides agreed to revive...",

The acclaimed performer was nominated four times and has previously nabbed the AFA best actor trophy twice — for “The Blood of Wolves” (2018) and “Perfect Days” (2023) — making him one of the most decorated actors in the awards’ history alongside Tony Leung and Lee Byung-hun. “I was truly humbled to hear the names of the past recipients and found myself in awe of such distinguished figures,” Yakusho said. “Receiving this award motivates me to strive for even better work in the remaining years of my acting career.” The ceremony is set for March 16 at Hong Kong’s Xiqu Centre in the West Kowloon Cultural District. In addition to the awards ceremony, Yakusho will participate in a screening of “Perfect Days” on...",

Olly Alexander’s performance with disco-style Dizzy saw the UK come 18th in Sweden’s Malmo in 2024, and Mae Muller’s I Wrote A Song in 2023 landed in second-last place in Liverpool. Remember Monday said: “What The Hell Just Happened? is exactly how we’re feeling right now. It’s all very surreal; our friendship goes so far back, and we definitely never imagined that we’d be doing anything like this. “When you’re a kid and people ask you what you want to be when you grow up, an absolute classic is ‘I wanna be a pop star’, so the fact that we’re getting the chance to live that dream as three best friends is just wild. “We’re going to be the first girl band to represent the UK since 1999, which feels like such a crazy honour. “We’re going to bring loads of fun, energy and hopefully do something that you won’t have seen before on the Eurovision stage. We honestly can’t wait to experience this with all of the other incredible artists from around the world, and hopefully make everyone back at home feel proud. “This is really the music World Cup and we’ll do our best to bring it home.” Their key change musical theatre-esque song was co-written with British duo...",

Since then, authorities conducted 1,300 meetings with some 65,000 Albanian parents who “recommended and were in favor of the shut down or limiting the TikTok platform,\" Education Minister Ogerta Manastirliu said. He said his department had been in talks with TikTok on installing certain protections such as parental control, age verification and the inclusion of the Albanian language in the application. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request to comment on the government's decision. When Prime Minister Edi Rama said in December they were aiming at closing the social media platform, TikTok asked for “urgent clarity from the Albanian government” on the case of the stabbed teenager. On Thursday Rama said they were in a “positive dialogue with the company,\" and that TikTok would visit the country soon to offer “a series of measures on increasing the security for children.” The company said it had “found no evidence that the perpetrator or victim had TikTok accounts, and multiple reports have in fact confirmed videos leading up to this incident were being posted on another platform, not TikTok.” Albanian children comprise the...",

Dell stock fell nearly 5% after the Feb. 27 release of its fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter results (for the three months ended Jan. 31). The company's mixed quarterly report, along with the lower-than-expected revenue growth forecast for the new fiscal year, were the main culprits.

Its client solutions group (CSG) includes sales of desktops, notebooks, workstations, and other computer peripherals.

For their part, Wales are on the back of 15 Test losses in a row that stretches back to the 2023 World Cup, although they displayed a considerable improvement under interim head coach Matt Sherratt against title favourites Ireland last time out. Here, the PA news agency looks at some key talking points ahead of the game. Scotland under huge pressure Gregor Townsend’s team went into the Six Nations rated by many as title dark horses, but they have so far proved to be several furlongs off the pace. Following losses to Ireland and England, they now host a Wales side revitalised by Sherratt. Grand Slam-chasing Ireland might have toppled them 27-18 in Cardiff, but they were given a monumental fright as Wales produced their best performance for almost 18 months. Scotland have never finished higher than third in the Six Nations, and a spluttering campaign will fizzle out if Wales claim a seventh win from the last nine Murrayfield visits. Can Wales back up Ireland display? Sherratt and his players will be eager to show that the Ireland game was not a one-off. Wales began life after Warren Gatland in a way few people thought possible, leading Ireland 18-10 at one stage as long-suffering supporters finally had something to shout about.

Transport was one of the highest expenditures incurred by households, The Household Consumption Expenditure Surveys for FY23 and FY24, released last year, found. Transport expenses have risen nearly two percentage points since 2011-12.

The refiner will be seeking one million barrel of WTI every month for arrival from May or June for four months, the source said. BPCL did not respond to Reuters request for comments. The Indian refiner last year awarded a similar tender to European major BP. BPCL often buys U.S. oil for its three refineries, which have combined capacity to process 706,000 barrels per day of crude. India's imports of U.S. oil last month climbed to their highest in over two years, ship tracking data show, as refiners in the country sought alternative supplies following tighter U.S. sanctions on Russian producers and shippers. India is planning to raise its energy imports from the U.S. to $25 billion in the near future from about $15 billion last year. The U.S. exported about 357,000 bpd crude to India, the world's third biggest oil importer and consumer, in February, ship tracking data from Kpler showed.

Chhetri's decision to rejoin the Indian national football team marks a pivotal moment, strategically timed to bolster the squad for critical upcoming qualifiers. Following his initial retirement announcement in June 2024, head coach Manolo Marquez successfully persuaded Chhetri to reconsider, emphasizing the player's indispensable experience and goal-scoring prowess. This return is particularly significant given India's participation in the FIFA International Window in March 2025, featuring a friendly against Maldives on March 19th and the crucial AFC Asian Cup Saudi Arabia 2027 Qualifiers Final Round match against Bangladesh on March 25th, hosted at Shillong’s Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. As India's all-time leading goal scorer and most-capped player, Chhetri's presence is expected to provide a substantial morale boost, reinforcing team cohesion and inspiring younger players. His consistent performance in the Indian Super League has demonstrated his continued top form. The AIFF's focus on building a strong, unified team underscores the strategic importance of Chhetri's return, as India navigates these high-stakes qualifying matches, with the nation's footballing aspirations resting heavily on his leadership.

Spurs' season now hinges on this European competition, and they fell short in the crucial round of 16 first-leg clash. The single-goal deficit, which came after Lucas Bergvall's own goal, is somewhat flattering considering their lacklustre performance. Tottenham managed only one shot on target against AZ, and even that was a questionable effort from Wilson Odobert in the second half, which seemed more like a misdirected cross that required a save from the goalkeeper. Following the disappointing display, Vicario, who was one of the few Spurs players to earn some credit for his saves, led the way to the 950 travelling supporters. He tried to encourage continued support by passionately raising his arms repeatedly. However, this move backfired as the surprised fans responded with angry words towards Vicario and the group of players who had followed him. The Italian appeared disheartened by the reaction and walked away from the group towards the tunnel. This isn't the first time Tottenham players have delivered a subpar performance and faced the wrath of understandably frustrated fans. Vicario later acknowledged that he understood the fans' frustration after his failed attempt to unite them. \"I can understand the disappointment for the night because we didn't play our football,\" he commented. \"So I can understand...",

        "content": "Workers at Germany's largest airports, including international hubs Frankfurt and Munich, are set to go on strike on Monday. Travel disruptions are expected. Trade union Verdi on Friday said workers at Frankfurt Airport and 10 other German airports are set to go on strike on Monday. Airports involved in Monday's strike action include the second-busiest in Munich, along with Cologne/Bonn, Düsseldorf, Dortmund, Hannover, Bremen, Hamburg, Berlin and Leipzig-Halle. Most employees of Fraport , which operates Frankfurt Airport, are under collective wage agreements, and could join the strike, due to begin at midnight on Monday morning (2300 UTC). Ground staff at the airport were also called on by Verdi to lay down tools on Monday. The so-called \"warning strike\" comes after a second round of wage negotiations for public sector employees fell through. What is the trade union demanding? Strikes at several German airports last week amid the ongoing wage dispute heavily disrupted travel. Verdi is seeking a collective wage agreement for around 2.5 million public sector workers. Demands include an 8% pay bump, higher bonuses, and three additional days off. Local municipalities and the federal government have said the Verdi proposals are not financially feasible. Other sectors included health care workers, 20,000 of whom went on strike Thursday. Workers at kindergartens were due to strike on Friday. Another round of negotiations is set to take place next week. Edited by Sean Sinico",

The Strictly Come Dancing pro, 47, and former England rugby star, 46, first met on the BBC show in 2013, sparking speculation that the infamous Strictly curse played a role in Cohen’s split from his wife, Abby. Though the sports star has always denied leaving his ex for the dancer, sources now claim financial struggles have driven him and Rihanoff apart. An insider told The Sun : “Ben left his wife Abby for Kristina, only to now split with her. It’s like the curse in reverse. “This will be like karma for Abby, she was so upset when Ben left her. It’s like he has got his comeuppance. “Those close to them who know them as a couple had hoped they would be able to work things out but for now it’s over and it looks like there’s no going back.” The couple, who got engaged in 2022 and share a daughter born in 2016, have allegedly faced a tough six months, even putting their £1.75 million Northampton home on the market. The pal added: “Those close to them who know them as a couple had hoped they would be able to work things out but for now it’s over and it looks like there’s no going back.” Last year, reports suggested they were fighting to save both their relationship and their home amid money troubles. In September, Rihanoff was taken to court for driving without insurance, with Cohen appearing as her witness. He revealed that his credit cards were overdrawn and that his business had...",

The 65-year-old’s contract runs until the summer of 2026 but the possibility of him being replaced is not entirely ruled out if Real Madrid fail to win any of the major trophies this season. Talks held with Alonso’s representatives Now, according to Mario Cortegana’s The Athletic , Real Madrid have held talks with the representatives of Xabi Alonso via an intermediary, with Ancelotti’s camp very much aware of the situation. The feeling at the club is that Alonso is the best-placed candidate to replace the Italian tactician at the Santiago Bernabeu. And some close to the situation even believe that the change could happen as early as this summer. The report further states that important voices at the Spanish capital club see Alonso, with his modern and dynamic style, as someone who can get more out of the current squad and revitalise the team. In case, Real Madrid do decide to move for Alonso at the end of the season, they are unlikely to face any problems from Bayer Leverkusen . Ancelotti not looking to leave Ancelotti, for his part, is aware of things happening in the background with Alonso but is not thinking of leaving Real Madrid. The Italian and his staff are fully focused on staying and winning more trophies at the Santiago Bernabeu. There is a belief that if Ancelotti...",

With yields of up to 6.4% backed by decades of annual increases, all three of these investment opportunities are highly compelling. In fact, you might end up wanting to buy all of them once you dig into the numbers. Here's why. 1. Enterprise Products Partners has a 6.4% yield Enterprise Products Partners is a North American midstream giant. It basically owns the pipeline , storage, processing, and transportation assets that help to move oil and natural gas around the world. The key is that it charges fees for the use of its assets, so the volatile prices of the commodities it transports are less important than the demand for those commodities to Enterprise's top and bottom lines. Demand for energy tends to remain high in both good markets and bad. This is how Enterprise has managed to increase its distribution annually for 26 consecutive years. The distribution, meanwhile, is covered 1.7 times over by the master limited partnership's (MLP's) distributable cash flow. And it has an investment grade-rated balance sheet. In other words, a lot would have to go wrong before the distribution would be at risk of a cut. That's the story that backs this 6.4% yield. Enterprise won't excite you, but that's the point. You can buy this midstream giant and rest easy while...",

The Sussexes can be seen getting to work in a kitchen - presumably the one in their Montecito home in California and are joined by their black labrador, Pula and their friends Kelly McKee Zajfen and Clare Waight Keller, as well as some of their own children. Meghan is seen making dough before they all lay the dough on a baking sheet and make holes in its centre with their thumbs. Lilibet is then seen watching her mother as she gets down to work, while in another shot the duchess is caught kissing Archie on his head, with Harry making a brief appearance observing the preparations as he rests his hands on the kitchen island. Meghan captioned the post: \"When making thumbprint cookies at home becomes a family affair! Thanks @_heartmom_ & @clarewaightkeller for the love and extra set of hands!

        "content": "Prolonged sitting is equivalent to physical inactivity and its health consequences has been a primary concern of health experts. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has advised to engage in 150 minutes of physical activity per week to give the body the minimum amount of movement and activity. Lack of physical activity or in other words long sedentary hours can lead to obesity, a major risk factor of several life threatening diseases. Health risks associated with sitting for too long A sedentary lifestyle is associated with an increased risk of heart diseases. Research indicates that individuals who sit for more than eight hours a day without physical activity have a risk of dying similar to the risks posed by obesity and smoking. Prolonged sitting slows down metabolism, affecting the body's ability to regulate blood sugar and blood pressure, and to break down body fat. This can lead to obesity and metabolic syndrome—a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Physical inactivity is a significant risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes. Extended sitting periods can lead to insulin resistance, a precursor to diabetes. Sedentary behavior has been linked to an increased risk of anxiety and depression. The lack of physical activity can affect mental well-being and cognitive function. If sitting is the new smoking, how can we quit? A 2016 study on the harmful effects of sitting is one of the studies that estimated the future of the...",

BPCL often buys U.S. oil for its three refineries, which have combined capacity to process 706,000 barrels per day of crude. India's imports of U.S. oil last month climbed to their highest in over two years, ship tracking data show, as refiners in the country sought alternative supplies following tighter U.S. sanctions on Russian producers and shippers. India is planning to raise its energy imports from the U.S. to $25 billion in the near future from about $15 billion last year. The U.S. exported about 357,000 bpd crude to India, the world's third biggest oil importer and consumer, in February, ship tracking data from Kpler showed.

It’s overpriced, elitist, indulgent, outdated and entirely irrelevant to what’s actually happening in the world,” he complains. But Ostermeier’s production absolves itself of most of these charges, even though it’s stuffed with enough big names – not least Cate Blanchett as deluded actress Arkadina – to ensure that tickets will only make their way into the hands of a lucky few. It probes the relationship between art, obsession and self-deception, poring over and riffing on its themes like a rock song (“Golden Brown” by The Stranglers patterns through its scenes). Blanchett’s Arkadina is wonderfully, hilariously crass, blinding the front row with her glittery jeans then nonplussing the whole audience by tapdancing into splits. Yet underneath the performative silliness, Blanchett conveys a sense of a cavernous emptiness – a detachment from her own emotions that means she can only express herself in a hammy karaoke of borrowed lines. Desperate for attention, she has flattered middlebrow writer Trigorin (an appropriately smug Tom Burke ) into loving her. But he’s also obsessed with Nina, an aspiring actor played with remarkable internal depth by Emma Corrin . When he cannibalises her pain and turns it into an idea for a trite story, she sees through him enough to slap...",

New Zealand face India in the final on Sunday and there are questions hanging on the availability of pace spearhead Matt Henry . Henry had injured himself while taking the all-important catch of Heinrich Klaasen in New Zealand's semi-final against South Africa in Lahore. \"I guess the positive thing from our perspective is he got back out there to bowl,\" said New Zealand head coach Gary Stead. \"We've had some scans and stuff done on him, and we're going to give him every chance to be playing in this match. Still a little bit unknown at this stage.\" While New Zealand lost to India by 44 runs in the group-stage encounter between the two sides in the tournament, Henry stood out with figures of 5/42. His victims included Shubman Gill , who had come into the match on the back of some red-hot form, for just two runs, Virat Kohli who had scored a century in the previous game, Ravindra Jadeja and Hardik Pandya. Henry has generally enjoyed a lot of success against India in all formats of the game. In the 2025 Champions Trophy, Henry is currently the highest wicket-taker with 10 wickets at an average of 16.70 and economy of 5.32. \"He's obviously pretty sore just from landing on the point of his shoulder,\" Stead said. \"Hopefully he will be okay.\" Henry's increasing threat Henry...",

Ukraine came under a “massive missile and drone” attack, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko wrote on Facebook. At least 10 people, including a child, were injured, authorities said. “Russia is trying to hurt ordinary Ukrainians by striking energy and gas production facilities, without abandoning its goal of leaving us without light and heat, and causing the greatest harm to ordinary citizens,” Halushchenko wrote. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine’s power grid during the war. The attacks have depleted electricity generation capacity and disrupted critical heating and water supplies. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of “weaponizing winter” in an effort to erode civilian morale. Russia fired 67 missiles from air, land and sea and launched 194 strike and decoy drones, Ukraine’s air force said. Their primary target was Ukraine’s natural gas extraction facilities, it said. For the first time, Ukraine deployed French Mirage-2000 warplanes delivered a month ago to help repel the attack, according to the air force. Ukraine also has Western-supplied F-16 fighter jets to shoot down Russian missiles. Ukrainian defenses downed 34 missiles and 100 drones, the air force said, while up to 10...",

        "content": "BERLIN, March 7 (Reuters) - Major airports across Germany, including its largest in Frankfurt, will be hit by a 24-hour strike on Monday after the German trade union Verdi called for employees in the public sector and ground handling services to walk out, it said in a statement. The union, which is calling for an 8% wage increase, or at least an increase of 350 euros ($379.79) more per month, decided to call the warning strike after a second round of collective bargaining failed last month. Employers have rejected the demands as unaffordable. Negotiations are due to continue later this month. Airports affected on Monday also include Munich, the country's second busiest, as well as Stuttgart, Cologne/Bonn Duesseldorf, Dortmund, Hannover, Bremen, Hamburg, Berlin and Leipzig-Halle. Frankfurt Airport and the airport in Berlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The planned strike marks a major escalation in negotiations after Verdi staged several walk-outs at some airports in Germany, including a two-day strike at Munich, last month Shorter strikes at the airports in Duesseldorf and Cologne/Bonn led to almost 280 flights with around 48,000 passengers having to be cancelled, according to the ADV airport association.

The post, uploaded by the couple's accounts @onairplanemode__ and @kirstieandchristine has garnered over 380,000 likes, leaving people online in hysterics. Viewers were able to see Pike watching a Pussycat Dolls music video featuring lead singer and dancer Nicole Scherzinger, her childhood celebrity crush . Moments later, her girlfriend, Christine Diaz, also 32, walks into the room, revealing a striking resemblance to the American pop star. The video, captioned, \"HAPPY NATIONAL COMING OUT DAY, the way I begged Christine to make this video with me, I MANIFESTED HER OKAY,\" plays into a popular internet trope: the uncanny similarity between current partners and past crushes . An overlaid text on the video reads: \"My childhood crush vs. who I am dating now.\" Pike and Diaz told Newsweek that the viral video was just a playful nod to a running joke among their followers. \"Together, we are the creators behind @onairplanemode__, an LGBTQ+ travel and lifestyle platform we founded in late 2019,\" the couple said. \"Our journey started with a mission to be queer women's representation we rarely saw in mainstream media.\" The resemblance between Diaz and Scherzinger,...",

        "content": "European shares fell on Friday as frequent shifts in U.S. trade policy throughout the week resulted in risk aversion, while focus remained on the day's upcoming key U.S. jobs data. The pan-European STOXX 600 was down 0.7% as of 0817 GMT, and was on track to snap its streak of 10 straight weekly gains. The benchmark index ended flat on Thursday as a boost from the European Central Bank's interest rate cut countered pressures from rising long-term bond yields. U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday suspended tariffs of 25% he had imposed this week on most goods from Canada and Mexico, the latest twist in a fluctuating trade policy that has whipsawed markets. Luxury stocks also weighed heavily on the main index; shares of Richemont lost 4.1%, Burberry slid 4% and Kering fell 2.6%. Retailers also fell sharply by 1.3%, dragged by a 3.8% fall in e-retailer Zalando, after it secured the purchase of 90% of About You's. All eyes were on the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, followed by a speech from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, which could provide clues about monetary policy outlook for the world's biggest economy. In other stocks, Grid operator Elia Group jumped 17% to the top of the STOXX 600 after reporting full-year results.",

        "content": "The Indian semiconductor industry can grow to USD 40 billion by 2030 by promoting the ecosystem around supply chain, including chemicals and gases involved in the making of electronic chips, a senior official of industry body IESA said on Friday. Speaking at IESA Vision Summit, India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA) President Ashok Chandak said India needs to learn from the global centers of semiconductors as it is a very complex technology. Any chip making touches at least more than 10 countries. It is very complicated. If we have to make semiconductor manufacturing successful in India, we have to take care of the supply chain that includes gases, the chemicals, materials, and most of the supply chain has to happen with the plants that are going to manufacture semiconductors, Chandak said. He said that in 2022, IESA had released a report on tha groundwork that needs to be done from the semiconductor ecosystem and it has now released a report which details out all the manufacturing cases for India. Overall, we estimate that the supply chain related market worldwide is going to increase to USD 420 billion by 2030 and if we aspire about 10 per cent share that means we are looking at a possible opportunity of USD 40 billion. This could happen through some of the global companies moving their base to India to make for India and also for exporting, Chandak said. With the existing framework, India's semiconductor industry can grow to USD 10 billion by 2030,...",

        "content": "NASARAWA, Nigeria, March 7 (Reuters) - The World Health Organization says it will send leprosy drugs to Nigeria this weekend after resolving testing hold-ups that led to a year-long delay in thousands of patients, including children, getting the medicine they need to prevent disability. Africa's most populous nation, Nigeria reports over 1,000 cases of leprosy yearly, a disease caused by a bacterium, Mycobacterium leprae, and mainly affecting the skin, peripheral nerves, and eyes. It is curable with multi-drug therapy, but without treatment, the disease progresses and causes disfiguring sores and disabilities like blindness and paralysis. Patients also face significant stigma. But Nigeria ran out of stock of the multi-drug therapy in early 2024 as a bureaucratic delay in supplies and new domestic testing regulations on imported medicines held up the drugs in India, where one of the components is made. The delay, which caused significant suffering in Nigeria, is just one example of the vulnerability of a global system that has seen stockouts in countries including India, Brazil and Indonesia in recent years, the U.N. special rapporteur for leprosy told Reuters. A WHO spokesperson told Reuters that Nigeria had run out of leprosy medications, and the U.N. health agency, which organises shipments of the drug, had asked for a one-time waiver on the new testing policy. In January that waiver was granted. \"A dispatch of leprosy drugs from India has been confirmed for 8 March, with...",

Partial U.S. tariff pause offers little relief U.S. President Donald Trump's stiff duties have been temporarily paused on some Canadian products, bringing little relief as the tariff threat continues to hang over America's closest neighbour. Trump signed an executive order Thursday delaying tariffs on goods that meet the rules of origin requirements under the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement, and lowering levies on potash to 10 per cent, until April 2. Ottawa responded by suspending a planned second wave of retaliatory tariffs. Markets have been in turmoil since Trump followed through Tuesday on his threat to impose a sweeping 25 per cent tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, with a lower 10 per cent charge on Canadian energy. Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly says businesses on both sides of the border need more certainty. Here's what else we're watching... StatCan set to release February jobs numbers today Statistics Canada is expected to release unemployment figures for February today. Economists polled by Reuters expect a gain of 20,000 jobs in the month, and for the unemployment rate to have ticked higher to 6.7 per cent. RBC Economics expects the unemployment rate held steady at 6.6 per cent in February and calls for a gain of 15,000 jobs.

The stock has rocketed more than 1,000% since 2022, bringing its market cap (share price times total shares outstanding) to $195 billion at the time of writing. That market cap is high for a company with just $2.8 billion in trailing revenue and $462 million of net income . Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have been all the rage on Wall Street, but even analysts can't overlook Palantir stock's expensive valuation . The consensus rating on the shares is currently neutral (hold). There is significant downside risk in Palantir shares. Investors are paying an astronomical multiple of the company's sales and earnings that it may not be able to justify. Meanwhile, other AI stocks trade at more reasonable valuations and may outperform Palantir over the next year. Here are two promising stocks in the chip and software markets that could be worth more than Palantir by next year. 1. Advanced Micro Devices Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD -2.77% ) is a leading supplier of chips for consumer PCs, video game consoles, data centers, and other markets. It has a market cap of $158 billion and trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of about 21. Wall Street analysts expect AMD's earnings to grow 42% annually over the next several years.

During the proceedings, the MLC cited the example of her Begusarai district where \"in many villages, girls are deprived of education as reaching the nearest school requires them to walk four to five kilometers\". Kumar lost his temper and said while still sitting in his seat,\"Do you people even know what we have done for girls' education? Village girls hardly went to schools in Bihar until we came to power.\" Thakur said to the CM, \"Sir please do not say that. I, too hail from a village.

While the launch initially proceeded as planned, with the booster successfully separating and returning to the launch tower for a \"catch\" maneuver, issues with the upper stage of Starship became evident shortly after separation. What Went Wrong? Less than 10 minutes into the flight, several Raptor engines on the Starship upper stage failed, causing the spacecraft to lose control. \"Once you lose enough of those center engines, you're going to lose attitude control,\" said Dan Huot, SpaceX communications manager, during a live-streamed broadcast. \"And so we did see the ship start to go into a spin, and at this point, we have lost contact with the ship.\" SpaceX later issued a statement confirming that \"prior to the end of the ascent burn, an energetic event in the aft portion of Starship resulted in the loss of several Raptor engines.\" The company added, \"this in turn led to a loss of attitude control and ultimately a loss of communications with Starship.\" According to Spaceflight Now, three minutes after losing contact, the rocket's self-destruct system activated, causing Starship to explode and scatter flaming debris along its flight path in a...",

Here are some of the key topics covered during his Friday press conference. China has clashed frequently with the Philippines over ownership of and access to islands in the South China Sea, whose rich fishing grounds China claims virtually in its entirety. However, Wang was quick to place blame elsewhere, saying Manila was being manipulated by forces “outside the region,” its standard term for the U.S. Wang called the entire conflict a “shadow play,” saying an unidentified regional official had used the term at a recent meeting, and said each incident was a “line of script” disseminated by the foreign media with the goal of “smearing China.” “China will continue to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in accordance with the law. When managing Second Thomas Shoal and Scarborough Shoal, we will also reflect our humanitarian spirit according to actual needs. But I want to make it clear here that infringement and provocation will inevitably bear its own fruit, and those who are willing to be chess pieces will eventually be discarded.” Wang also said that Chinese cooperation with its neighbors had eliminated many of the compounds where Chinese nationals, many of them coerced or lured by false promises...",

Sources close to the matter revealed, “Christopher Nolan has held meetings with the James Bond producers about directing the next installment.” These talks come after Nolan’s Oppenheimer swept the 2024 awards season, earning him his first Best Director Oscar and raking in over $976 million worldwide. With that chapter closed, the filmmaker is reportedly free to take on a new challenge. Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson are keen to bring Nolan on board.

        "content": "Crossbows are a “lethal weapon” that should be more tightly regulated, a minister has said, following triple murderer Kyle Clifford’s conviction for rape. Clifford used a crossbow to kill his ex-girlfriend Louise Hunt and her sister Hannah Hunt, as well as stabbing their mother Carol Hunt to death at their home in Bushey, Hertfordshire, last July. He had already admitted to the murders, but on Thursday was also convicted of raping Louise Hunt in what prosecutors described as a “misogynistic” attack. Asked on Friday whether the case showed crossbows should be banned, health minister Stephen Kinnock told Times Radio: “I think crossbows are a lethal weapon and they should be regulated.” Adding he was “sure” the Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, “will be looking at this”, he said: “It does seem to be too easy to get hold of a lethal weapon like a crossbow and it does seem that something does need to be done about that.” It is currently illegal to sell crossbows to people aged under 18 or carry one in public without a reasonable excuse, but there is no licensing or registration scheme for the weapon and adults are free to buy them. The previous Conservative government launched a consultation in February 2024 on introducing further controls on crossbow ownership after a 2021 incident in which a man, armed with the weapon, gained entry to the grounds of Windsor Castle. That consultation suggested a firearms-style licensing scheme for crossbows, but progress was stalled by last year’s...",

We've already celebrated New Year's Day (January 1), so the next one to look forward to is Good Friday, which is fast approaching! Four bank holidays occur within a short span of each other. In just over a month, we have Good Friday on April 18, followed closely by Easter Monday on April 21. Shortly after, we have the Early May Bank Holiday on May 5 and the Spring Bank Holiday on May 26. This year also marks the 80th anniversary of VE day, or Victory in Europe Day, which is observed on May 8 each year. This day commemorates the end of World War II in Europe and signifies the Allies' acceptance of Germany's surrender in 1945. With calls for street parties and four days of concerts, services, and processions to honour the day, many Brits are left wondering if they'll get an extra bank holiday. However, a spokesperson from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) confirmed back in November that the VE day celebrations in 2025 will not include an additional bank holiday in 2025, reports the Manchester Evening News .

At the U.S. National Coffee Association annual convention in Houston this week, attendees said they have been in shock at a 70% increase since November for Arabica coffee futures on the ICE exchange, the benchmark for coffee deals around the world. Renan Chueiri, director general at ELCAFE C.A. in Ecuador, said this year is the first time the instant coffee maker hasn't sold all of its expected annual production by March. We would usually be sold out by now, but so far we sold less than 30% of production, he said. The big price increase eats clients' cash flow, they don't have all the money to buy what they need. The coffee price hikes have stemmed from lower production in important coffee growing regions, particularly in top grower Brazil, reducing the availability of beans. Nobody wants to be exposed, nobody is buying for future delivery, it is all hand to mouth, said one coffee broker, asking not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. By hand to mouth , he was referring to the practice of buying only what is necessary for the moment and eschewing stockpiling.

Shane doesn’t want to go to an evacuation centre because he doesn’t “handle crowds very well”. “Some people are going to go behind the buildings there, out of the wind,” he says, pointing to a service station and some apartment blocks on the Hornibrook Esplanade.

The bomb was found on the tracks during overnight works, train line RER B posted on X. Media said the discovery was made in the area of Saint-Denis, a suburb of Paris. The Eurostar and all other trains were halted as police worked to disable the device. Eurostar's website shows trains from London to Paris scheduled to depart before 10:30 GMT on Friday were cancelled, and routes from Paris to London before noon local time (11:00 GMT) were also cancelled. Eurostar said on its update that \"due to an object on the tracks near Paris Gare du Nord, we are expecting disruption to our services this morning\". Passengers could exchange their ticket for free to travel at another date or time in the same class, subject to availability, the train company said. Eurostar services from London to Lille were running as normal. Trains to Brussels and Amsterdam from London were largely unaffected. Queues were beginning to form by 8:30 GMT at St Pancras train station in London as passengers tried to work out their next steps. One group was approaching the front of the line after a two-and-a-half hour wait. Their 07:00 GMT train was cancelled and they planned to travel to Lille and make a three-hour bus journey to Paris.

Ukraine came under a “massive missile and drone” attack, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko wrote on Facebook. At least 10 people, including a child, were injured, authorities said. “Russia is trying to hurt ordinary Ukrainians by striking energy and gas production facilities, without abandoning its goal of leaving us without light and heat, and causing the greatest harm to ordinary citizens,” Halushchenko wrote. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine’s power grid during the war. The attacks have depleted electricity generation capacity and disrupted critical heating and water supplies. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of “weaponizing winter” in an effort to erode civilian morale. Western-supplied air defense systems are crucial for Ukraine’s fight but further U.S. help is uncertain under U.S. President Donald Trump, who says he is determined to end the war and has paused American military aid for Kyiv as a way of pressuring Zelenskyy to negotiate. In his nightly address, Zelenskyy said Thursday he would travel to Saudi Arabia on Monday to meet the country’s crown prince, and his team would stay on to hold talks with U.S. officials. Zelenskyy welcomed a European Union plan to bolster the continent’s...",

        "content": "After two years of double-digit gains, the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC -1.78% ) lost its momentum -- at least temporarily -- in recent days. The index has slipped more than 4% over the past two weeks due to concerns about the tariffs President Donald Trump has placed on imports from China, Mexico, and Canada. These tariffs -- 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada and 20% on goods from China -- went into effect earlier this week. The White House later put into place a one-month delay on tariffs for automakers complying with the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement's trade rules. Any such flexibility could reduce some of the negative impact on companies, and the market is likely to be on the lookout for more such moves or flexibility from the Trump administration. Still, economists have warned that the tariffs rolled out as planned could push prices higher and support the case for a longer period of high interest rates. That sort of situation could weigh on costs of companies that manufacture goods abroad and hurt sales of those that rely on imports. On top of that, higher prices may rein in consumer spending. All of this together represents uncertainty for corporate earnings growth, prompting some investors to hesitate before buying stocks. Does this mean you should flee the stock market? Not at all. Instead, to protect your portfolio, here are three things every investor should do. 1. Ensure diversification The first thing you should do is review the contents of your portfolio to ensure...",

Read our privacy policy While some relegate their body fake tan to the back of the bathroom cabinet come winter, a facial tanner remains a year-round essential for most. These glow-getting formulas give you post-holiday radiance, despite being bundled up in knitwear. Whether it’s a cream from the likes of Tan Luxe or Isle of Paradise’s cult drops (designed to be mixed with your moisturiser), there are plenty of products promising to achieve an effortless sun-kissed glow. But, when it comes to an instant pick-me-up, tints and bronzing drops are an increasingly popular choice. The craze began with Drunk Elephant’s D-bronzi drops , which could barely stay in stock last year. Other brand’s quickly followed, with Elf and Isle of Paradise’s bronzing formulas becoming bestsellers for the respective brands. Now, St Tropez has launched its own take. Founded in 1984, St Tropez is a leading brand in the beauty world. Chances are every fake tan fan has dabbled with one of its formula over the years, whether it’s the flagship mousse or gradual lotion. For the brand’s latest launch, it has created a hybrid bronzing drops and fake tan formula that gives skin an immediate glow, but develops into a deeper tan over three hours. In...",

        "content": "Sachin Bansal, founder of fintech firm Navi said that UPI will eventually become credit-driven rather than debit-driven. “The future of UPI is not debit. A significant part of UPI transactions will be powered by credit, not direct bank transfers. Payments will increasingly be made using a credit product, earning rewards and other benefits,” Bansal said during a fireside chat at an event organised by consultancy firm Redseer in Bengaluru. His remarks come at a time when India’s digital payments landscape is undergoing a transformation, with players like Rupay Credit on UPI seeing rapid adoption. According to Bansal, Rupay credit cards now account for 60% of all credit card spends in India, with 90% of those transactions happening on UPI. Bansal's words come in just a few week after he resigned as the CEO of Navi and will continue in the capacity of Executive Chairman of the Navi Group. Navi’s entry into UPI was initially met with skepticism, given the dominance of PhonePe, Google Pay, and Paytm. However, Bansal’s firm quickly climbed to become the fourth-largest player in November of 2024.

With a loan book of Rs 11,000 crore, Bansal acknowledges the need for a balance between secured and unsecured lending as the company scales. \"If we are handling lakhs of crores in loans in the future, there's no way we can have 90% of our...",

After a strenuous battle of voting, and tipping other very worthy desserts out of the way, Tiramisu had to battle it out for people's votes and bites against another nostalgic hot favourite, Black Forest cake. In the final showdown, Tiramisu managed to garner 72 percent of the votes as opposed to Black Forest's 28 percent. To give you an idea of the voting pool, Pubity has a social media following of nearly 40 million. A post shared by Pubity (@pubity) Long before it was officially crowned as 'the best dessert from around the world', Tiramisu has easily made a home in the hearts and tummies of countless sweet teeth but that still doesn't take away from the fact that it is a complex recipe to achieve. You may think all you need are the premade ladyfingers, lots of espresso and some bottled up mascarpone with a dusting of coffee — and this will temporarily satisfy your craving for the mean time — but nothing, is going to hit as bittersweet as that first scoop of an authentically crafted Tiramisu.

Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, while presenting the state budget in the Assembly on Friday, highlighted the success of providing eggs six days a week, which has significantly improved student attendance. Currently, around 53 lakh students receive eggs or bananas twice a week to combat malnutrition. This initiative has now been extended to six days a week with the assistance of the Azim Premji Foundation. The Chief Minister assured that the government would sustain the program throughout 2025-26. In addition to eggs and bananas, the distribution of ragi health powder mixed with hot milk will also be expanded. Previously offered three days a week, this nutritious supplement will now be available five days a week. The total cost of this expansion is estimated at ₹ 100 crore, with 25% being funded by the state government. The remaining cost will be covered by Shri Sathya Sai Annapoorna Trust, which will contribute the Sai Sure ragi powder mix.

The Criminal Code of Canada broadly outlines gambling as legal, but each province has its own authority to manage specific forms like casinos, lotteries, and online gaming. This creates a landscape where residents across Canada have differing access to and rules for gambling activities based on local laws.Understanding these laws is essential for anyone looking to participate in gambling within Canada, whether in a local casino, through a provincial lottery, or via online platforms. Here, I’ll go through the ins and outs of Canada’s gambling laws, looking at federal guidelines and examining the distinct rules in each province to provide a clear picture of what’s permitted, where to find help, and information. Provincial Gambling Regulations in CanadaAlbertaIn Alberta, gambling is closely regulated by the Alberta Gaming, Liquor, and Cannabis (AGLC) authority. The province offers multiple land-based casinos, mainly located in larger cities like Calgary and Edmonton. These casinos are often tied to charitable organizations, with a portion of their revenue supporting community programs. Alberta is also home to a few First Nations casinos, operated in partnership with the AGLC.Online gambling in Alberta is available through PlayAlberta, the province’s only government-regulated online platform.

In fact, I’ve spoken to hundreds of gamblers over the last decade or so, and very few can tell me what RTP means in casino gaming. I don’t want you to be one of those players, which is why we’re going to tackle this often-overlooked concept right now. Indeed, because every game is different, you can only make optional choices if you know how RTP casino values can affect your potential win rate. So, what does RTP mean, and how do gambling experts use it to make smart decisions when playing online casino games? Return to player definitionThe RTP gaming meaning you need to know if you want to play slots, blackjack, roulette, and other popular online casino games is:Return to Player, often referred to using the acronym RTP, is a measure of a casino game’s theoretical payout potential.In simple terms, RTP is the percentage of money you can expect to get back over time based on the amount you wager. I could say that RTP or return-to-player values represent your odds of winning, but that’s not strictly true because there are other factors to consider. Before I unpack the concept of casino gambling odds in its entirety, let’s make sure we’ve covered the basics of RTP. As I’ve said, RTP in gambling is the expected returns from a game over time. That means values are calculated over the course of 1 million bets or more. Determining RTP values over time...",

While many people believe this technique is illegal, the truth is that it’s not against the law. Card counting is simply a mental strategy that players use to track cards and adjust their bets based on the likelihood of certain cards being dealt.However, despite its legality, casinos strongly discourage card counting and have the right to take action if they suspect a player is using this method. This could include banning the player from the casino, denying service, or even sharing the player’s information with other casinos.What is card countingCard counting is a technique used primarily in blackjack to track the ratio of high to low cards remaining in the deck. Players assign values to the cards dealt, typically +1 for low cards (2-6) and -1 for high cards (10-Ace), and maintain a running count to estimate the remaining deck’s composition. The goal is to try and determine when the deck is in the player’s favour, allowing them to adjust their bets accordingly. While card counting is a legal mental strategy, it’s frowned upon by casinos, which may take action against players who use it.How does counting cards workCard counting involves tracking the ratio of high and low cards remaining in the deck.

It’s key to fully understand more about them before playing though, as I have seen too many gamblers get frustrated by not doing this.One thing I think is crucial to know is that any slot is a game of chance. This means there’s never any guarantee of winning when spinning the reels. But are slot machines rigged? The simple answer is no.Having done a lot of research into this, I can confirm they’re not. Read on to find out how I came to this conclusion, how slots work, how they vary in terms of volatility and how robust regulation protects players.How slot machines workThe best place for me to start when answering the question “are online slots rigged?” is how slot machines actually work. For me, the most important thing to get onboard with is how RNG (random number generation technology) works in any slot.RNG tech is the foundation of all slots and uses complex algorithms to ensure total fairness on every spin. I found that slots use this technology to make sure each outcome when I spin the reels is totally random, and cannot be interfered with by the casino. To make playing these games even fairer, RNG means that the probabilities in the slots I play remain the same on every spin. One thing you might be thinking about in terms of how slots work is house edge. In my opinion, this is something players should also understand because all slots come with a house edge.

This whole thing has been shared by royal editor Bronte Coy and, in her interview with, Matt Wilkinson and The Sun’s royal photographer Arthur Edwards, on The Sun’s Royal Exclusive show. While the conversation saw comments by Mr Edwards as well, Ms Coy explained was of the opinion that “There wasn’t a sense of self-awareness about how lavish it all was” and while “there’s a way to make that work,” this “didn’t land at all. It just felt overly glossy, and again.” It is pertinent to mention that he concluded his sentiment in that conversation by saying, “I think it was a con. She was so nice [on her show], but pretty sure she wasn’t so nice to her own staff at Kensington Palace. It was false. Absolutely false.” Conversably Ms Coy made an effort to note all the ways it could have been salvaged and noted that while there was “one big chance to steer the ship in a different direction” what it comes down to is that “human nature loves gossip - even people who hate Spare or hate-watched Harry & Meghan have an element of curiosity.” “I think they did the right thing moving away from that, but they needed to sell themselves in a different way - and she hasn’t really landed it,” she noted before signing off.",

Read on to learn about two ETFs with particularly attractive profit potential. Less red tape, more green arrows The Trump administration has made deregulation a priority. President Donald Trump believes fewer unnecessary regulations will result in lower costs for businesses and consumers and higher economic growth. If he's right, the financial industry could be about to receive a powerful boost. Investing in the Vanguard Financials ETF ( VFH -1.70% ) is a great way to potentially profit from a rally in financial stocks. The fund holds shares in over 400 businesses in the financial sector. This includes banks, asset managers, mortgage providers, payment processors, exchanges, and insurance companies. As of Jan. 31, key holdings included JPMorgan Chase , Berkshire Hathaway , Mastercard , and Goldman Sachs . Regulatory decisions can sometimes create operational burdens that affect the financial sector. If the Trump administration enacts changes that end up reducing compliance costs for banks and other financial services providers, profit margins should rise. Deregulation might also usher in a wave of dealmaking, which could bring more efficiencies to the industry and...",

This remarkable find in Thailand extends the history of human occupation in the area by many millennia. Nicknamed \"Pangpond\" after a much-loved Thai cartoon character, the ancient child's remains were found in a secluded cave situated within the scenic Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park. The Fine Arts Department (FAD) made the announcement, highlighting that the juvenile burial, detected in the prehistoric rock art haven of Din Cave, is believed to surpass 29,000 years in age. It challenges established views on Thailand's human history and offers an intimate look into people's existence during the late Pleistocene epoch. The FAD's Director General, Phnombootra Chandrajoti, proclaimed: \"This is a groundbreaking discovery that will reshape our understanding of early human presence in Southeast Asia. \"The careful burial and the associated artifacts provide invaluable insights into the rituals and daily lives of these ancient inhabitants.\" An FAD archaeologist elaborated on the significance of the burial method, saying: \"The body was carefully placed and surrounded by stones, indicating a level of respect and care in the burial process. \"The positioning of the limbs, with the toes touching, suggests the body may have been wrapped or tied before burial.\" The child's remains were discovered in a supine burial position, with the head facing southwest,...",

Law and order plays an important role in the economic development of the state, he said, adding zero tolerance policy has been adopted against those who disrupt social harmony and strict and decisive action is being taken. Six underground naxals have surrendered before the naxal surrender and rehabilitation programme committee during our government tenure. With this, Karnataka has become naxal-free and hence the anti-naxal force will be disbanded, Siddaramaiah said. He said the surrendered naxals will be brought to the social mainstream and to provide basic facilities in the affected areas, a special package of Rs10 crore will be formulated. Further, the Bengaluru Safe City project has been implemented at a cost of Rs 667 crore, the CM said. As part of the project, 7,500 cameras have been installed across the city, while 10 drones and 560 body-worn cameras have been provided. A total of 60 women outposts have been set up across the city to foster a public sense of security among women and ensure prompt police assistance for women and children who are victims of crime, he said.

The first two Oasis albums were extraordinary, but their fourth – re-released today on silver vinyl – is at best so-so. It opens gloriously with the rowdy F****** In The Bushes, a combative instrumental driven by a snarling Zeppelin-like riff, adorned with quickfire samples from the Isle Of Wight festival. As hooligans tear down fences, we hear a promoter rant, “We worked for one year for you pigs...” The track feels simultaneously dangerous and uplifting. But nothing else comes close to it. The Gallaghers famously channelled the Beatles on earlier releases – hence the title. There are nods to the Fab Four here too, but largely the band sound more like their own tribute act. Go Let It Out is Oasis-by-numbers. Gas Panic! aims to recapture the potency of festival anthems like Live Forever but collapses under the weight of its own 6-minute-plus pomposity. Along the way we get a self-indulgent slice of trippy sub-Kula-Shaker psychedelic tripe (Who Feels Love?) and Little James, Liam’s banal ballad for his stepson, with basic sub-Imagine piano chords and lyrical doggerel. David Bowie. Young Americans. Rock chameleon Bowie pulled off his greatest twist by embracing Philly soul on this re-issued 1975 album which gave him his first US chart-topper with Fame, co-written with John Lennon and guitarist Carlos Alomar.

The agreement would establish a framework for increased military and defence cooperation and collaboration between the two nations and improve interoperability between their forces, the Philippines' defence ministry said in a statement. \"The Philippines looks forward to the positive impact of the SOVFA, which is expected to contribute to peace, stability, and cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region,\" the ministry said, calling it a milestone in bilateral defence relations. Canada has supported the Philippines' stance in the South China Sea, backing a 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration that said China's vast South China Sea claims had no legal basis. China rejects that finding. In 2023, the Philippines and Canada signed an arrangement for the use of Ottawa's Dark Vessel Detection system to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing by vessels that have switched off their location transmitters to evade detection. Amid rising tensions in the Indo-Pacific, the Philippines has broadened its security partnerships while maintaining its long-standing alliance with treaty ally the United States.

        "content": "March 7 (Reuters) - Britain's Treasury department is weighing cutting funding plans for state-backed power company GB Energy in a spending review slated for June, the Financial Times reported on Friday. Last year, the British government set up GB Energy, backed by 8.3 billion pounds ($10.73 billion), and envisaged it to be its primary tool to drive investment in renewable energy. The company was expected to partner with the Crown Estate - which oversees the British monarch's public holdings - to bring 20-30 gigawatts of new offshore wind developments to the seabed lease stage by 2030. \"We are fully committed to GB Energy, which is at the heart of our mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower and to ensure homes are cheaper and cleaner to run\", a UK government spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement. GB Energy couldn't be immediately reached out for a comment. One of the options that the Treasury is weighing is cutting the 3.3 billion pounds previously earmarked to fund low-interest loans via local authorities for projects such as solar panels on roofs and shared-ownership wind projects, the newspaper said. The reduction in funding comes at a time when Britain targets to largely decarbonise its power sector by 2030 by reducing its reliance on gas-fired power plants and rapidly increasing its renewable power capacity. Britain's deputy finance minister Darren Jones said in January that the government would conduct the first zero-based review of spending in 17...",

Mike Tyson has had an extremely impressive and wild life, both in the ring and outside of it. From Tyson’s ear-biting bout against Evander Holyfield which was refereed by a TV judge , to the appearance of Iron Mike in a Nintendo bestseller , all the way to his 8-second knockout of Joe Cortez in Tyson’s bout with him in the junior Olympics, the heavyweight sensation has done a lot in his career. He retired with a pro record of 50-7, and just yesterday marked 40 years since Tyson’s professional debut . Aside from recently facing Jake Paul , Tyson doesn’t spend much time fighting, but that doesn’t stop him from holding the pads for his son. Fans unimpressed by Mike Tyson’s son’s boxing ability In the newly resurfaced footage, recently posted on X, Tyson can be seen holding pads for his son, who seems to be trying to emulate his aggressive style.

Though if it was real training, then fans are...",

A portfolio of China's top seven technology firms, labeled the '7 Titans' by Societe Generale SA, has gained over 40% in 2025. The combined market value of these companies, which include Alibaba Group Holding, Tencent Holdings, Xiaomi, BYD Co, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, JD.com Inc, and NetEase Inc, has increased by $439 billion.Meanwhile, the US 'Magnificent Seven' stocks—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla—have fallen by about 10% since the start of the year. This downturn has pushed the Nasdaq 100 Index close to a correction. The decline has been more pronounced in recent weeks, coinciding with DeepSeek's impact on US markets.DeepSeek’s Unique Position in AIUnlike leading AI startups in the US, which are valued in the tens of billions and backed by major investors like Microsoft and Amazon, DeepSeek operates with no external investors beyond its founder, Liang, and his cofounders.

The project includes a 148 km rail network with 58 stations, significantly boosting intercity and suburban connectivity. The Namma Metro expansion also received a major push, with plans to extend the network by 98.60 km over the next two years, including an extension up to Devanahalli. Currently, Namma Metro serves 8.5 lakh daily commuters across 79.65 km with 68 stations. To tackle the city’s growing traffic congestion, the government will make major roads signal-free through multiple initiatives: A 40.5 km double-decker flyover along with Namma Metro Phase 3, costing ₹ 8,916 crore. -300 km of additional roads using canal buffer zones at ₹ 3,000 crore. -460 km of arterial and sub-arterial roads at ₹ 660 crore. -120 km of flyovers and grade separators to improve traffic flow.

The ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average , benchmark S&P 500 , and growth-dominated Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC -2.61% ) have all soared to numerous record-closing highs. But following this monster rally in equities, Wall Street's highest-flying index, the Nasdaq Composite , is beginning to fade. Although the Nasdaq technically ended March 4 outside of correction territory -- down 9.4% from its all-time closing high on Dec. 16, 2024 -- it declined by 10.7% on a peak-to-trough intraday basis between Feb. 18 (20,110 high) and March 4 (17,957 low). For at least a brief period, the Nasdaq moved into correction territory. When the stock market's major indexes move lower by 10% or more from a recent high, these declines are rarely gradual. Emotions tend to run high during downturns, as evidenced by the roughly 700-point intraday swing for the Nasdaq Composite on March 4. At the moment, nothing is ruffling investors' feathers more than the uncertainty tied to President Donald Trump's tariffs . Based on data from economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, stocks performed poorly when Trump announced tariffs on goods from China in 2018 and 2019, and we appear to be witnessing an encore of this performance, but on a broader scale, in 2025. Although it's unclear if the Nasdaq stock drop will steepen in the weeks to come, there are four exceptionally safe, historically inexpensive,...",

Scottish Widows has found 19% of single people can’t see a situation where they’ll ever be able to stop work. This compares with one in seven (13%) people who are married or living with a partner who don’t think they’ll ever have enough money put aside to retire. Researchers found two-fifths (42%) of people who are married or living with a partner feel optimistic about retirement, compared with just three in 10 (30%) future retirees who are single. Half (50%) of those with a spouse say they’ve carried out research to prepare for retirement, versus 37% of single people. The majority (57%) of people who are married or cohabiting have also checked their state pension entitlement, compared with a third (33%) of single people. People who are married or living with a partner are also more likely to have received financial advice, with a quarter (25%) saying they have done so, compared with 13% of single people.

Australia’s prime minister has told residents along the country’s east coast to “hope for the best, but prepare for the worst” as a tropical cyclone nears landfall, bringing violent winds that have prompted mass evacuation orders and cut off electricity to 80,000 homes. Tropical Cyclone Alfred was 125km (78 miles) east of Brisbane city on Friday afternoon, crawling towards the densely populated coastline at “walking speed” and is expected to make landfall early on Saturday, government forecasts said. Recommended Stories “When nature does its worst, Australians are at our best. We rally. We lift each other up. We look out for our neighbours,” Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters. Bureau of Meteorology manager Matt Collopy said the storm was expected to weaken as it approached Brisbane. “This will mean that destructive winds are unlikely for Brisbane itself, but damaging wind gusts up to 120km/h (75mph) are expected and they will develop quickly as the system approaches,” he said. Al Jazeera’s Sarah Clarke, reporting from Brisbane, said the “slow-moving” storm made it possible for big and densely populated areas of Australia to prepare and evacuate. She said while Brisbane is still calm, the situation on the eastern coast of the country is “deteriorating” as the storm approaches, with huge waves reported in the Gold Coast.

It’s absolutely worth celebrating and Mayor Adams, who has made crime-fighting a priority, should take a bow. The cause could be the leadership of Police Commissioner Jessie Tisch — who’s clearing out dead wood and, driven by data, refocusing the NYPD on its core mission. It might just be the frigid end of 2024 and start of 2025. It might be a little of both or something else entirely. But there are some very positive public safety trends afoot in New York City right now. Just as people’s hair catches on fire when things are going in the wrong direction, we should appreciate progress. Robbery, once considered the bellwether of street dangerousness, dropped 25% from last February to this. Grand larceny was down 17%. Felony assaults, a crime that has seen sharp and stubborn increases since the pandemic, went down 6%. Murders fell by 32%. And in the first two months of 2025, the city suffered 93 shooting incidents — the lowest total over that period since the city began keeping this particular statistic back in 1993. Those aren’t just lower numbers. They represent less human tragedy rippling through families and communities, and less fear and more confidence among New Yorkers.

The 23-year-old's off-field issues led to his departure from the Red Devils last summer, but since joining Ligue 1 outfit Marseille, he's been in scintillating form, scoring 16 goals in 26 appearances. This resurgence has sparked talk of an England recall. However, Greenwood, who has one England cap, was overlooked by former boss Gareth Southgate. With Southgate's exit post-Euro 2024 and Thomas Tuchel at the helm, FA chief Mark Bullingham has clarified that Greenwood is not in the frame for an England return. \"That's happened formally, so he wouldn't be able to (play for England) because you can only switch once,\" Bullingham stated. \"We actually didn't have that communication. I know people asked Gareth about him, and Gareth was upfront in that he hadn't been in his thinking, because he hadn't been performing at that level, so I'm not aware of any communication we had with him. \"I don't think there was ever a request or anything like that. It just wasn't one we got to, so it's a personal decision by him.\" Greenwood has reportedly asked to switch his international allegiance, with Jamaica believed to be the country he wishes to represent. The Caribbean nation is currently managed by former United assistant manager Steve McClaren, who worked briefly with Greenwood at Old Trafford in 2022 before leaving Erik ten Hag 's backroom staff.

Her appointment in 2024 as an ambassador for the World Food Programme (WFP) has given the three-time Grand Slam finalist a chance \"to do some good\", particularly in the empowerment of women. \"I wanted to be able to use my platform and represent the woman I am and where I come from, to try to make a change in the world,\" Jabeur told BBC Sport Africa ahead of International Women's Day. While highlighting global food insecurity is part of her work with the WFP, the 30-year-old says the focus on women is also key. \"People think it (the WFP) is only related to food, but it's also education and helping women. \"When you help women, they get the opportunity to work and provide for the whole family, and that's really important.\" One of Jabeur's first assignments was attending projects in Cairo where she saw first-hand how women were trying to improve their lives. \"I was preparing bread with one of the women and you have no idea the big heart that they have. \"She almost gave me everything that she made, and I was like, 'No, please, you keep it. You have to sell it!' \"Even though they don't have enough, they were very generous and that is what everyone should stand for.\" Education in vulnerable areas is another important issue for Jabeur. \"A woman went to school at a late age. I told her she was very courageous and very proud that she's going with her kid to...",

        "content": "Chelsea defender Levi Colwill says manager Enzo Maresca is \"light years above everyone else\" in the way that he thinks about football. The England centre-back, 22, has played 25 times for the Blues this season in Maresca's first season in charge. They are in the hunt for the Champions League places, sitting fifth in the Premier League table. Colwill spoke to BBC Football Focus about a range of topics - and you can watch the interview in full on BBC One at 12:00 BST on Saturday. BBC Sport has some of the highlights here. Italian Maresca, 45, was Manchester City assistant boss before winning promotion to the Premier League with Leicester last season. He swapped the King Power Stadium for Stamford Bridge in the summer. \"I think with Maresca, the way he thinks about football is light years above everyone else,\" said Colwill. \"Of course, I have been blessed with loads of different managers that have been amazing. \"He is pushing me to understand football in a different way. That's why I'm very blessed to play football under him and learn as much as possible.\" Colwill has also played under Carlos Corberan, Graham Potter, Roberto de Zerbi, Mauricio Pochettino, Gareth Southgate and Lee Carsley. Colwill has been at Chelsea since under-nine level. \"I came through with the likes of Jamal Musiala, Tina Livramento, Myles Peart-Lewis, Lewis Bate. My age group was amazing. You can see the difference between Chelsea academy players and others,\" he said. \"The treatment you get at Chelsea,...",

Instead, it breaks the mold of those that came before, and it’s genius. Hero Shooter fatigue has shown up in recent years, as few new entries manage to break past the giants that define the genre. However, that might change with Fragpunk, the adventure that breaks both the mold, and the rules. Essentially, Fragpunk places players into a fast-paced 5v5 battle, complete with the choice of 13 different Lancers and your own weapon type. All this happens inside a close-ranged map designed to keep the combat fast, deadly, and ever changing. However, the real rulebreaker, literally, here, are Shard Cards, which completely flip the game on its head, so no battle is ever the same. Rules are for chumps Shard Cards serve as rule changers for both your team and the enemy’s. Through selecting these cards every round you can grant buffs to your team, nerfs to the enemy, or even alter the map’s landscape from a city street to a frozen wasteland. Now place that into a combat scenario and your team has the capability to completely flip a match around. For example, you could be playing Shard Clash while losing to the team that always plants their bomb where you’re not expecting it. So, you pull a Site Deletion card, forcing them to go to the only other site available, where you can destroy them without care. The ability to change the...",

        "content": "India’s higher education sector has immense potential for making a substantive impact on the future of India. The demographic situation of India is poised to help us achieve higher levels of social and economic development. With more than a billion people who are less than 35 years of age, there is a natural aspiration for young Indians to seek opportunities to pursue university education. But this cannot be just an aspiration, it has to become a policy imperative. The National Education Policy (NEP) has envisaged an ambitious 6% target for Gross Domestic Product (GDP) investment in higher education but the reality is that actual investment is only 4%. The Gross Enrolment Ratio of India is 28%, although the aspiration of NEP is to raise this ratio to 50% in the next 10 years. This means that we need a large number of higher education institutions to be established at a relatively shorter span of time with significant investment at all levels. All these points lead to only one direction. There is a need for significant expansion in the idea of private, not-for-profit, and philanthropically enabled higher education institutions in India. Given the need for significant capital for establishing these institutions in a short span of time to fulfil the needs and aspirations of the youth of India, our dependence on state funding has to be limited. Unfortunately, we also cannot promote private, mediocre, and for-profit type institutions, which will further exacerbate the challenges...",

But progressives over our northern border in Canada are successfully exploiting Trump's return to the White House, where he threatened for weeks to levy tariffs on imports from across the border and then implemented them Tuesday before pulling back temporarily on some of them Thursday. Trump's penchant for attacking allies like Canada and Mexico while cozying up to geopolitical foes like Russia has inadvertently rescued the Liberal Party of Canada , which looked to be on its way out of power until he started talking. That comes at a steep cost to the Conservative Party of Canada – with a heap of irony on top – since it had adopted Trump's style of populist rhetoric and tactics that helped him win November's presidential election. That was popular in Canada until Trump started casting the American ally and top trading partner as an economic foe he might just take over. \" Canada First! \" – the Conservative Party motto cribbed from Trump's MAGA playbook – is suddenly and swiftly out of fashion. Federal elections are looming in Canada. Nik Nanos, a Canadian pollster, put it to me this way: \"Donald Trump is going to be the uninvited guest in the next Canadian election, and may very well influence who Canadians decide to pick to lead Canada in dealing with the Trump administration.\" Trump's MAGA rule has...",

Peak XV Partners is a venture capital and growth investment firm primarily focused on investing in companies across India and Southeast Asia. \"We've witnessed over 30 IPOs in the past 19 years, including 16 in the last five,\" he said at the Moneycontrol Global Wealth Summit 2025 in Mumbai, reflecting on the firm’s journey. But navigating IPO pricing, he admitted, remains a tricky business.

And yet, two years down the line, the same company might have doubled in value,” he said, highlighting the unpredictable nature of public markets. His takeaway? An IPO isn’t the final destination—it’s just a milestone. “If you see it that way, you stop thinking of it as the moment to maximize everything,” he said. But when pricing misfires, the consequences can be long-lasting. \"We've seen cases where IPOs were priced at the peak, and four years later, investors have made no money.

        "content": "Britain's cheese preferences are evolving, with a notable shift towards stronger cheddar varieties. While mild and medium cheddars have historically dominated the market, sales data reveals a growing appetite for extra mature and vintage options. Artisan cheesemaker Ford Farms, specialising in strong cheddars, has witnessed a surge in demand. This trend is further corroborated by Tesco, which has increased pack sizes and orders for its own-label top strength cheeses to meet the growing consumer interest. These cheeses require a maturation period of 18 months before reaching peak flavour. Experts attribute this shift to the increasing popularity of spicier cuisine in Britain, which has, in turn, accustomed palates to bolder flavours. The latest 12-month volume sales data from all retailers analysed by Kantar showed the demand for vintage Cheddar growing by 5.4 per cent and extra mature Cheddar up by 2 per cent. But sales of medium Cheddar has fallen by 5.6 per cent and mild Cheddar down by 2.4 per cent. At Tesco, demand for extra mature and vintage Cheddar have increased by nearly 25 per cent in the last year. Tesco UK cheese buyer Darren Atherton said: “The gradual move towards stronger tasting Cheddar varieties has come about because of our love of spicy food. “With curries, Asian and Mexican food now a regular part of the UK diet, our palates are acclimatising to these stronger and more exotic flavours so that we tend to go for more complex taste profiles. “This has been...",

The 88-year-old pontiff reportedly had a restful night, waking shortly after 8am, according to Vatican officials. Doctors, citing his continued stability and absence of respiratory issues, indicated they would likely provide the next medical update on Saturday. On Thursday, however, the Pope offered a poignant, albeit concerning, indication of his current health. In a recorded audio message broadcast to those gathered in St. Peter’s Square for the evening rosary, Francis expressed his gratitude for the prayers offered on his behalf. His voice, however, was barely audible, strained by labored breathing. Speaking in his native Spanish, he said: \"I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your prayers for my health from the square, I accompany you from here. “May God bless you and the Virgin protect you. Thank you.” This message, while reassuring to many, served multiple purposes. It was the first public communication from the Pope since his admission to Gemelli hospital on February 14, effectively quashing unfounded rumours circulating about his condition. More significantly, it revealed the extent of his physical weakness. Even for those accustomed to his often-whispered pronouncements, the audible struggle to breathe was a stark reminder of his current fragility. The cardinal presiding over the prayer, Cardinal...",

        "content": "India's road to the Champions Trophy 2025 final has sparked significant debate, with many questioning the advantage of playing all their matches at a single venue in Dubai. While other teams have had to adjust to varying conditions, frequently traveling between Pakistan and the UAE, India have stayed in one city. This scheduling decision by the ICC has drawn criticism from pundits and former players, who argue that it has given Rohit Sharma’s men an undue edge in the tournament. However, India's star Test batter Cheteshwar Pujara doesn't find merit in this argument. According to Pujara, the scheduling of the Champions Trophy had already been confirmed weeks before the tournament, and UAE was picked keeping in mind the logistical comfort. “I don't think so. The schedule was out there before the Champions Trophy began, the reason for Indian team to not travel to Pakistan was the security. ICC and BCCI worked together to try and find a neutral venue. India have played against Pakistan at a neutral venue, and UAE is closer to Pakistan,” Pujara told RevSportz . Advantage of ‘talent’ Pujara believes the one advantage India boast of is the talent that they have in the squad. The India batter highlighted the key difference between India and other teams, stating that the side boasts of four quality spinners, which gives it the edge. “I don't think it's an unfair advantage. If India had lost, no one would've said they played in Dubai, that's why they lost. I don't think it's a home...",

These tariffs could significantly disrupt India’s export-oriented industries. The sectors that are expected to face challenges include pharmaceuticals, automobiles, medical devices, textiles, and gems and jewellery. While short-term volatility is expected, long-term structural adjustments could shape future trade policies. Negotiations between governments and alternative trade agreements may help cushion the impact in some areas. Here are the sectors that may be affected by these reciprocal tariffs: The auto and auto ancillary sectors are particularly vulnerable to higher tariffs on exports to the US. As tariffs increase, pricing pressures could reduce competitiveness and slow down export growth. Market expert Neeraj Dewan, in an ETNow discussion, addressed the growing fears in this sector, explaining, \"Automobiles also there is a lot of fear about tariffs, that is mostly maybe happening more towards the auto ancillary part.\" Companies like Mahindra & Mahindra and Maruti are expected to be among the affected players. Despite the concerns, some market analysts believe that investors should focus on specific stocks rather than making broad sector-wide adjustments. Medical devices are another key export category that may face tariff-related disruptions. In an ETNow interview, Sandip Sabharwal of...",

        "content": "HSBC UK has reduced its standard variable rate (SVR) on homeowner mortgages from Friday. The move will mean lower monthly payments for homeowners who have moved from a fixed rate and chosen not to take another mortgage product with the bank. The rate has been reduced by 0.25 percentage points, from 6.99% to 6.74% – the bank’s lowest SVR since January 2023. In general, homeowners can end up on their bank’s SVR when their initial deal comes to an end. SVR rates are set by individual banks. The move follows the recent quarter-point cut in the Bank of England base rate, to 4.5%. Oli O’Donoghue, HSBC UK’s director of mortgage lending, said: “Following a review, we are reducing our standard variable rate to 6.74%, which will benefit those customers who have chosen to transition onto an SVR after their fixed-rate term has finished.” The bank has not disclosed how many customers are on its SVR. In general, people on SVR typically have a smaller outstanding balance than those on a fixed-rate or tracker mortgage. HSBC UK said it is also expanding the availability of its mortgages to foreign national residents in the UK, by bringing lending rules for foreign nationals into line with UK residents for those who come direct to the bank, following similar changes to broker-originated mortgages last year. Among the changes, its standard policy requirements will apply where just one customer on an application has indefinite leave to remain. This is a change from requiring that both customers...",

After War and her brother moved in, she became convinced the house was haunted. She would see people and hear noises at night. “It sounded like someone was walking around, to the point that I would jump out with a machete in my hand, thinking someone had broke into the house,” she says. “It was happening all the time. I thought I was going insane in here.” It was confusing, “because I have been crazy before. And I was also drinking a lot and sometimes that makes me hallucinate.” But the apparitions weren’t ghosts, or the result of a mental health crisis, or indeed a drinking binge: “I didn’t have any money, so I couldn’t get the house inspected or anything,” says War, 35. “I was kind of squatting for a while. So I didn’t find out until after a year that there were really bad gas leaks in the heating system – that’s what was causing it. The people who inspected it were like: ‘How long have you been here? This is really dangerous.’” The gas leaks are fixed, the hallucinations have stopped and War got a song out of it: Ghosts, an exploration of her father’s death and its aftermath, appears on her new album, Armageddon in a Summer Dress.

Vicario kept Ange Postecoglou’s side in contention to reach the quarter-finals with several fine saves as Spurs put in a disappointing performance in the Netherlands. The Italian went to the away fans after the full-time whistle and raised his arms in a gesture that appeared to be encouraging them to show more support. That did not go down well with some and Vicario reacted angrily before leaving the pitch.

It’s just a way of trying to stay together because we have the opportunity to go through to the next round.” Asked whether the Tottenham supporters could make a difference in Thursday’s second leg, when Rodrigo Bentancur will be suspended after a yellow card, he said: “We need them every game, home and away. We know they are very important for us and now is a big moment of the season and with them we can play with one more man on the pitch, so it’s so important ...

Spiritbox’s versatile frontperson Courtney LaPlante can throat-shred with the best of them, yet suddenly dip into a croon. Take the two equally terrific singles from their second album. Soft Spine is a jagged boulder of invective hurled at the fakes and sickos in her industry, smashing into a punkish chorus of screamed contempt; Perfect Soul is soulful, reflective hard rock with a cleverly multitracked LaPlante cleanly singing of the gulf between her public and self perceptions. Elsewhere, the aptly titled Keep Sweet is their poppiest song yet, with liquid drum’n’bass verses giving way to a groove-metal chorus, while LaPlante bobs on a gentle, ruminative melody through the otherwise stormy title track. Their adventurous songcraft occasionally gets the better of them. Another foray into drum’n’bass on Crystal Roses is tepid and – weirdly, considering the heaviness elsewhere – lacks the ferocity and instability of true jungle, while the proggy experiment No Loss, No Love feels unkempt. The production throughout is heavily compressed, sometimes to the detriment of the low end.

Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government aims to guarantee encrypted communications between the government, diplomats and defence officials operating in risky areas. Reuters reported this week that Eutelsat is among companies in talks with the government along with U.S. billionaire Elon Musk 's Starlink, which dominates the sector with 6,700 active satellites against just over 600 owned by Eutelsat. \"In the Italian interest it would be odd to choose a French entity instead of a more technologically developed and avant-garde system like the American one,\" the League said in a statement late on Thursday, without naming the two companies. Matteo Salvini's far-right League, part of the Italian ruling coalition along with Meloni's Brothers of Italy and the more moderate Forza Italia, is a strong supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump to whom Musk is a close adviser.

Prince William is determined to maintain what Winston Churchill once described as the \"special relationship\" between the United States and Britain. A source recently told The Telegraph that the Prince of Wales, who is heir to the British throne, holds a \"really powerful, really important\" influence on the future of that \"special relationship\" between the two nations. According to the insider, the father of three’s emerging relationship with President Trump is the \"key\" to making that possible.

They take our money and they don’t spend it.” The 2022 law (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors) he flails is doing more to rebuild American manufacturing than anything Trump did in his first four years in power — when he claimed getting factories humming again was a central priority but did precious little to actually make that happen in a sustainable way. First, some context that’s crucial to understand, especially for Republicans who claim Democrats eviscerate manufacturing jobs while the GOP has a knack for creating them. After manufacturing jobs took a huge dip in the wake of the Great Recession from 2009-2010, they steadily grew on President Barack Obama’s watch, from around 11.5 million to 12.3 million. Then they kept growing during Trump’s first four years, to about 12.8 million — before COVID hit, the bottom fell out of the economy and they plummeted to about 11.4 million. They finally climbed back up to 12.2 million jobs by the end of Trump’s term, meaning he ended his term with fewer manufacturing jobs than he started. Under President Joe Biden, the gains in factory employment were bigger and more sustained, going up to 13 million jobs. There are lots of reasons why that happened, chief among them the...",

U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and John Hickenlooper , D-Colo., and Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif., introduced the Romance Scam Prevention Act, which would require dating apps and services to issue fraud ban notifications to users who have interacted with a person removed from the app. The move came as Americans are more than ever connected thanks to social media and dating apps that allow us to stay in touch with old friends all over the world and to develop new relationships online.

With various theories surfacing during the investigation, Paul Mauro, a retired NYPD inspector and Fox News contributor, says there's one key detail that could solve the mystery of when the couple died. \"The public shouldn't jump to too many conclusions,\" said Mauro , who has an extensive background in law, law enforcement and intelligence issues. \"Investigators are going to get a lot of digital evidence. Reportedly, there are no cameras [in or around the house], but that doesn't mean there are no cameras in the area. It's a gated community.

Why It Matters Trump's campaign promises to roll back regulations and foster innovation garnered him support from many in the business world, including major industry leaders.

        "content": "Daylight saving time (DST) is due to go into effect across most, but not all, of the United States and its territories on Sunday at 2 a.m. local time. However two American states, and five territories, are exempt either in part or in full. Why It Matters The biannual clock switch for most Americans has become increasingly debated in recent years with a number of prominent figures, including President Donald Trump in December, calling for it to be abolished. In 2022, the Senate unanimously passed the Sunshine Protection Act, which proposed making DST permanent year-round, but did not pass the House of Representatives. The legislation was reintroduced the following year but again failed to pass into law. What To Know Every year, DST comes into effect from the second Sunday in March until the first Monday in November, in accordance with a uniform set of rules that were established for nearly all states by the Uniform Time Act of 1966. However the state of Hawaii is exempt as is Arizona , with the exception of areas under the jurisdiction of the Navajo Nation. These instead operate on permanent standard time. Additionally, the time switch does not apply to the U.S. overseas territories of Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands. Hawaii doesn't impose DST due to its close proximity to the equator, meaning there is less variation in the time of sunset over the seasons. Thus one of the main rationales for DST, which is to conserve...",

Reese played with LSU in two seasons from 2022-24, leading the Tigers to its first NCAA Championship. She ended her LSU career as the leader in most career rebounds per game (14.4). Reese was a rebound machine in the WNBA, breaking the record for most rebounds (446) in a rookie season. She also set the record for consecutive double-doubles with 15. Reese could have broken the general record for most rebounds in a season if she didn't have a wrist injury to end her rookie campaign. \"I'm very excited the Sky will play a preseason game at LSU,\" Reese said in a release . \"It will be amazing to return to Baton Rouge, a community that means so much to me.

Greenock Wanderers will host a Friday night thriller in Inverclyde, kicking off a busy weekend of action in and around Scotland's Six Nations clash against Wales on Saturday afternoon. (Image: Greenock Wanderers) The Fort Matilda outfit's under 14's side will face Ayr under the lights on Friday night in what promises to be an enthralling encounter, kicking off at 7.30pm. It is hoped that the tie can draw a bumper crowd as well as members, with the men's first team's season now drawing to a close. Their tie last week against North Berwick was cancelled after the borders side were unable to field a team for the third time this season and that means they now face an all but impossible task of securing their National Division Four status.

On Saturday, the focus is fully on the Wee Wandies, who will get the chance to train at Fort Matilda, beginning at 10am before all eyes turn to the big match at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff at 4.45m.

Framed by the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in the north and the Chihuahuan Desert in the south, the US’s fifth-largest state is a land of rolling sand dunes, prehistoric petroglyphs, fairytale caves and dormant volcanoes. Equally as diverse as the topography is the culture, which reflects the history of the Indigenous, Hispanics and Anglo Americans who have coexisted in New Mexico for centuries. You’re most likely to first encounter this diversity through the cuisine — a bright and colourful melange of Native American, Mexican and Spanish flavours makes it one of the state’s biggest draws. But with fiery green chilli stew and billowing, fluffy frybread demanding attention, the story of one item at the table is easily overlooked: wine. Long before Californians planted their first vineyards, New Mexico was growing grapes. A Native American pueblo just south of Albuquerque was the first recorded site of a vineyard in the state, established by two Franciscan monks in 1629. By 1880, more than 3,000 acres of vineyards were producing 908,000 gallons of wine, making New Mexico the fifth-largest wine producer in the country. Over the next century, New Mexico’s wine production declined due to a series of devastating floods, coupled with the rise of competitors like California. Wineries began resurfacing in the 1970s and by the new millennium, New Mexico was producing nearly one million gallons of wine. The industry has...",

Many patients are experiencing symptoms lasting up to 10 days—longer than the usual 5-7 days. While the seasonal transition typically brings a wave of flu, the intensity and scale of infections this year have raised serious concerns. A new survey by LocalCircles has revealed a troubling statistic: 54% of households in NCR currently have one or more individuals experiencing flu or Covid-like symptoms . What the survey reveals about this health crisis To better understand the impact of the viral outbreak, LocalCircles conducted a survey across Delhi, Gurugram, Noida, Faridabad, and Ghaziabad. Over 13,000 residents participated, with 63% of respondents being men and 37% women. The findings show that: 9% of respondents reported four or more sick individuals in their household. 45% stated that two to three members were experiencing flu symptoms. 36% reported no illness in their household. 10% did not provide a clear response. These results highlight a massive jump in flu-like illnesses compared to August 2024, when only 38% of households were affected. The sudden spike has prompted experts to investigate whether a new viral strain is at play or if worsening air quality and weather fluctuations are contributing factors. Is it just the flu, or something more serious? Doctors across NCR are reporting a sharp...",

        "content": "Legendary Sunil Gavaskar believes Rohit Sharma should not be content with scoring just 25-30 runs and must focus on building longer innings, as his presence at the crease can have a game-changing impact for India. In ODI cricket, the Indian skipper has embraced an aggressive approach to give India quick starts, but this has often resulted in early dismissals. His highest score in the ongoing Champions Trophy is 41 against Bangladesh in the opening game. (If) He (Rohit Sharma) bats for even 25 overs, India will be around 180-200. Imagine if they have lost only a couple of wickets by then; just think what they could do. They could reach 350 or more, Gavaskar told India Today. He also needs to give it some thought. It's one thing to go out and play aggressively, but there has to be a bit of discretion somewhere to give himself the chance to bat for 25-30 overs. If he does that, he takes the game away from the opposition. That kind of impact is match winning. Rohit has managed scores of 20, 15, and 28 against Pakistan, New Zealand, and Australia respectively in the tournament. And I think, as a batter, are you happy with scoring 25-30 runs? You shouldn't be! So that is what I would say to him: your impact on the team will be even greater if you bat for 25 overs instead of just seven, eight, or nine overs, Gavaskar said.

On Thursday, Sharma hosted a house warming at his newly allotted residence in Tughlaq Lane, Delhi. He took to X and shared pictures of the ‘Graiha Pravesh’ along with his family and wrote, “Today, along with my family, I performed the house warming ceremony of my new residence at Swami Vivekanand Marg (Tughlaq Lane) in New Delhi, as per the rituals and prayers.” Both Sharma and Gurjar have officially designated Tughlaq Lane in the national capital as Swami Vivekananda Marg, as reflected on the nameplates of their respective residences. The move comes as several BJP MLAs have put forward proposals to rename various parts of the city -- such as converting Najafgarh Assembly constituency to Nahargarh, Mohammadpur village to Madhavpuram, and transforming Mustafabad into Shivpuri. Recently, while speaking to ANI, BJP MLA Anil Sharma stated, “The corporation had passed a proposal to change the name of Madhavpuram village long ago. That proposal has been pending in the Assembly for a long time. Till now, there was a government of the Aam Aadmi Party, they must have kept it buried somewhere.

        "content": "Did you know that certain plants could be toxic to your pets? Pets are naturally curious and may occasionally be tempted to sniff, lick or chew on plants, bushes or trees. However, some plants can harm your pets, so it's crucial to know which ones pose a risk. This way, you can avoid planting them in your garden. Gardening expert Fiona Jenkins from MyJobQuote.co.uk has shared her insights on which plants could be harmful to your pets and why. Fiona is a UK-based landscaper with over 25 years of experience in the industry. Plants to avoid if you have pets include Oleander. The Oleander plant is the most dangerous plant for your garden as it's highly toxic to both animals and humans. Even a small amount ingested can result in death. Physical contact with the plant can also cause severe skin irritations and allergic reactions. It's vital to keep Oleanders away from children and pets. If your garden is frequently visited by pets or children, it's best to avoid this plant entirely. This is the safest measure you can take to protect your pets and family. Always wear protective clothing and gloves when handling Oleanders to protect your skin. Another plant to avoid is Foxgloves. Foxgloves, a common sight in woodlands and gardens, are laced with toxic cardiac glycosides. If an animal consumes any part of this plant, it could lead to severe poisoning. Deadly Nightshade is another perilous plant, boasting purple and green flowers and smooth oval leaves. It sprouts green berries that...",

He said: \"I'm worried to ask Charlie and Naga. \"I don't know if Charlie's been listening, but we'll find out now.\" Charlie appeared off-guard before quickly replying: \"Yes! Listening, listening to everything you're saying.\" However, that didn't seem to be the case because the BBC host asked: \"Again, what's the question?\" Realising Charlie hadn't been listening Gethin burst out laughing as Kimberley clapped in amusement. Gethin then asked if he stores his bread in the fridge or not, as Naga could be heard strongly disagreeing. She said: \"No! Never.\" Charlie shook his head as he seemed to agree with his co-star. Adding another option, Naga added: \"In the freezer, if you only have toast, then it's really easy. It doesn't go off.\" Taking a cheeky swipe at Charlie, Gethin told Naga he was glad that she was listening. Charlie replied: \"Have we been listening? Of course we listen!\" Deciding to turn the situation around, Naga asked Gethin and Kimberley: \"What were the last three articles we spoke about here on Breakfast?\" It seemed as though her remark caught the Morning Live star as he started to stutter before commenting: \"I mean, good point.\" Elsewhere in the show, Naga found...",

The order was issued by the Economic Offenses Court, presided over by Justice Vishwanath C. Gowdar. The DRI, which uncovered a gold smuggling racket at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) on Monday night, requested her custody from Thursday, citing concerns over a \"threat to national security.\" On the same day, Ranya’s lawyers filed a bail plea, arguing that after her arrest, DRI officials presented her before a judge at his residence on Tuesday night but did not seek custody. As a result, she was initially placed under 14-day judicial custody. They contended that since she is a Bengaluru resident and available for questioning, she should be granted bail. However, the DRI opposed the request, insisting they needed to investigate the source of the gold bars, the method of payment, how she managed to smuggle the gold undetected, and her intended purpose for it. Ranya, the daughter of Karnataka DGP (Police Housing Corporation) Ramachandra Rao, was apprehended upon arrival from Dubai with 14.8 kg of gold. Further searches at her Lavelle Road residence led to the seizure of additional gold ornaments worth Rs 2.1 crore and Rs 2.7 crore in cash. Who is Ranya Rao?

To focus on companies with strong market capitalization, we filtered out stocks with a market cap of less than Rs 5,000 crore. Generally, high-priced stocks tend to have lower trading volumes compared to others, as acquiring even a single share requires substantial investment.

Sudan has been at war since fighting broke out in April 2023 between the army and the RSF over disagreements ahead of a planned transition to civilian rule. The war has caused a humanitarian disaster , with mass displacement and widespread hunger . A UN report published on Thursday found \"a widespread pattern of arbitrary detention, torture, and ill-treatment of detainees\" by both the RSF and the Sudanese army. The freed Egyptian captives had been working in Khartoum for years importing household goods and small electric appliances.

Latest maps from WXCHARTS show a flurry of snow coating the UK in the next week. On Tuesday 11 March by 12 noon, maps show snow will hit parts of Scotland and the north of England including Newcastle and the Lake District. It will also stretch down to Birmingham and London with much of the Midlands with a small part of North Wales also seeing some snow. In the east of England, there will be rain rather than snow with much of this part of the country seeing 0.2mm of rain per hour. By 3pm on the same day, snow will move west across the UK reaching more areas including much more of the midlands and Wales. Maps show areas impacted will be Newcastle, Manchester, Birmingham, Cardiff and Sheffield which will see around 0.2-0.4cm of snowfall per hour. By Tuesday 11 March at 6pm, most of the UK will see freezing temperatures. The coldest temperatures are likely to be seen in the Yorkshire Dales where -7C will be seen. According to the Met Office , high pressure will build across the UK from the northwest during this period. It says: “This will bring north or northeasterly winds during the middle of next week, with a mixture of sunny spells and some showers. “The showers are likely to be most frequent in the north and east, and they will bring some snow to high ground. “Temperatures are expected to be below normal.

The agreement would establish a framework for increased military and defence cooperation and collaboration between the two nations and improve interoperability between their forces, the Philippines' defence ministry said in a statement. The Philippines looks forward to the positive impact of the SOVFA, which is expected to contribute to peace, stability, and cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region, the ministry said, calling it a milestone in bilateral defence relations. Canada has supported the Philippines' stance in the South China Sea, backing a 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration that said China's vast South China Sea claims had no legal basis. China rejects that finding. In 2023, the Philippines and Canada signed an arrangement for the use of Ottawa's Dark Vessel Detection system to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing by vessels that have switched off their location transmitters to evade detection. Amid rising tensions in the Indo-Pacific, the Philippines has broadened its security partnerships while maintaining its long-standing alliance with treaty ally the United States.

The book covers a range of themes starting from the Iranian Revolution through the eyes of the elite to the inner struggles of family matriarchs, to the fall of once powerful families reduced to mere wealth. All this is framed by the author’s wicked humour and a sheer exaggeration of female emotion. The narrative unfolds through five different perspectives across a span of 80 years. At the heart of the story is Elizabeth, the matriarch of the family. When the 1979 revolution begins, she is frail and elderly yet chooses to stay in Iran with her husband. Given the family’s wealth and high profile along with their noble lineage as descendants of the great warrior Babak Ali Khan Valiat, Elizabeth insists that her two daughters flee the country for their own safety. Like many other Iranians at the time, they travel to the United States (US), seeking the opportunities of a new life. Offering a unique perspective on the Iranian Revolution, the book is filled with secrets, rage, and the struggles of identity for migrants. But, one must be prepared for a long journey where the flow and pace of the story often test the patience. As one follows the story of Elizabeth’s daughters, Shirin and Seema, it comes forth how they struggle to reconcile their Iranian heritage with their new lives in America. Meanwhile, their rebellious granddaughter,...",

        "content": "COLOMBO, March 7 (Reuters) - Sri Lanka and Japan signed agreements on Friday to restructure $2.5 billion worth of debt, completing two years of talks that will assist the island nation in getting back on its feet after a severe financial crisis. The agreements will allow the two countries to restart projects, including an expansion of Sri Lanka's main airport, which were suspended after the island nation announced in April 2022 that it was defaulting on its foreign debt. The crisis left Sri Lanka struggling to pay for fuel, medicine and cooking gas. But it has made a faster-than-expected recovery, aided by a $2.9 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which approved the fourth tranche of its program last week. \"Sri Lanka's journey to full economic recovery is far from over. We must continue on the reform path and within the parameters of the IMF program to ensure that Sri Lanka does not fall back into a crisis,\" Mahinda Siriwardena, Sri Lanka's finance ministry secretary, told reporters at the signing ceremony. Sri Lanka entered into a preliminary deal with key lenders to restructure bilateral debt last June. It still needs to sign similar agreements with China for about $4.75 billion in debt and with India for $1.4 billion in debt to continue the IMF program. China and Sri Lanka agreed on more investment and economic cooperation when Chinese President Xi Jinping met recently elected Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Beijing in January....",

The Social Security Administration (SSA) has responded by reducing its staffing target to 50,000 employees, down from the current level of approximately 57,000 employees. The agency has also identified cost savings opportunities in contracts, grants, property, and technology, as well as \"common-sense approaches to printing, travel, and purchase card policies.\" The total savings will exceed $800 million in fiscal 2025, according to the SSA.

        "content": "Image source: X A Rs 5,000 crore man, famous for his wealth, has disclosed that his key to happiness is a surprisingly modest daily routine. As his wealth was in the news, it was his job at home that really defined his marriage. Dividing responsibilities in a simple yet meaningful manner, this routine was a major factor in their enduring union. The surprising home custom is an expression of a greater value of mutual respect and affection, laying the groundwork for a distinctive path to marital bliss. Even with his staggering fortune, this man's insistence on keeping things humble in his relationship shows how little things can mean so much to one's own life. Man worth Rs 5,000 crore highlights the importance of cooking for strong relationships Dr. A Velumani , worth Rs 5,000 crore and the owner of Thyrocare , recently made a touching gesture in paying homage to his late wife, Sumathi Velumani, praising the importance of cooking in a relationship. According to him, people who indulge in cooking manage to form healthier emotional connections and are less likely to struggle to maintain relationships irrespective of their finances. In his X post, Velumani paid tribute to his wife for managing family work and her SBI career. He reminisced about how he made a contribution by doing the dishes, a small but significant action in their joint venture. Velumani also emphasized the need for educating children in cooking, especially in families with yearly incomes from Rs 5 to Rs 25 lakh,...",

Wang's remarks came during his annual press conference here as he replied to a question on how Beijing views the course of bilateral ties after the two countries ended the prolonged stalemate in the ties. \"China-India relations have made positive strides over the past year\" after the successful meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping at Kazan in Russia, Wang said. Both Xi and PM Modi provided strategic guidance for the improvement of ties at the Kazan meeting, Wang said on the sidelines of the annual session of China's parliament currently underway here. After this, both sides earnestly followed through on the important common understanding of the leaders, \"strengthened exchanges and practical cooperation at all levels and achieved a series of positive outcomes\", he said. India and China completed the disengagement process late last year after firming up a pact for the withdrawal of troops from Depsang and Demchok, the last two friction points in eastern Ladakh, ending over four years of freeze in ties. After the finalisation of the pact, PM Modi and Xi held talks in Kazan on October 23. In the meeting, the two sides decided to revive the various dialogue mechanisms. After that, National...",

One of cricket's longest rivalries, India vs Pakistan matches inspire intense emotion on both sides of the border. Despite Pakistan cricket's current predicament, the league stage encounter versus India made headlines for a number of reasons, including Virat Kohli's century, Shreyas Iyer's half-century, and Kuldeep Yadav's three-wicket haul. The India-Pakistan encounter attracted a record number of views, more than the 2023 ODI World Cup match between the two nations. In a lopsided Champions Trophy match on March 2 at the Dubai International Stadium, India defeated Pakistan by six wickets . Following 62 runs from 76 balls from Saud Shakeel and a grueling 46 from 77 deliveries from captain Mohammad Rizwan, India bowled out Pakistan for 241. Kuldeep Yadav (3/40), a left-arm wrist spinner, took three wickets, while Hardik Pandya (2/31) eliminated Shakeel and Babar Azam (23). Kohli (unbeaten 100), Iyer (56) and Shubman Gill (46) helped India finish the chase in 42.3 overs. Despite his recent slump, Kohli demonstrated why he is regarded as one of the best in the ODI format with a match-winning performance in a pivotal match. Rohit Sharma, the captain (20 off 15), also hit a couple bold strokes before getting caught off guard by Shaheen Afridi's beauty.",

        "content": "Gold hit new highs during February supported by a weaker US dollar, extending its y-t-d gains to 9%, according to a World Gold Council report, which adds that rising inflation expectations, lower rates, and continued geoeconomic uncertainty are playing in gold’s favour.Gold continued its uptrend in February, hitting multiple new highs before pulling back to end the month at US$2,835/oz – up 0.8% m/m. This performance was echoed across major currencies, all of which also registered new record highs. General interest in gold was bolstered by continued flows of gold into Comex Inventories, driven by continued tariff uncertainty.According to World Gold Council’s Gold Return Attribution Model (GRAM), US dollar weakness during the month was one of the primary drivers of gold’s performance, alongside an increase in geopolitical risk and a drop in interest rates. And while gold’s strong price performance in January created a small drag, it was counterbalanced by positive support from flight-to-quality flows. This was best illustrated by gold ETF activity, which saw massive net inflows of US$9.4 billion (100 tonnes) – the strongest month since March 2022 – led by the US and Asian listed funds.The “Trump trade” – which hinged on the pro-US growth agenda of the new administration and fuelled a dollar and stock rally post US election – appears to have faded. While European stocks continue to do well, the major beneficiaries have been risk-off assets such as Treasuries and gold.Trump‘s...",

The Sensitive Price Index (SPI) also showed a decline, reinforcing expectations that March’s inflation figures will be lower, further supporting sentiment. The Pakistan Stock Exchange's (PSX) benchmark KSE-100 Index gained 685.52 points, or 0.6%, closing at 114,398.69. The benchmark index touched an intraday high of 114,721.58, while the lowest level was recorded at 114,169.19. \"One factor driving the market is the news of circular debt resolution, which has led to a rise in PSO and other related stocks. Secondly, the cement sector is performing well, most likely in anticipation of a policy rate cut expected on March 10. The third factor is the positive momentum continuing from yesterday, supported by strong liquidity in the market,\" said Sana Tawfik, Head of Research at Arif Habib Limited. \"Lastly, the SPI (Sensitive Price Index) figure has shown a decline, which reinforces expectations that March’s inflation figures will also come in lower, providing another positive signal for the market,” she added.

On Thursday, two South Korean KF-16 fighter jet s mistakenly released four MK-82 bombs each on a civilian area in Pocheon, a city near the tense border with North Korea. The bombing, which injured nearly 30 people, two of them seriously, occurred when South Korean and U.S. forces were engaging in a live-fire drill in connection with their broader Freedom Shield command post exercise set to begin Monday.

South Korea and the U.S. announced details of the exercises on Thursday, but it was overshadowed by the news of bombing which drew intense public criticism in South Korea. Both the South Korean and U.S. militaries halted all live-fire exercises across South Korea. Military officials said that South Korea’s air force also stopped the flights of its entire aircrafts except surveillance planes and others needed for emergency situations.

        "content": "European leaders on Thursday agreed to support Ukraine and increase its defence spending after US President Donald Trump suspended military aid to the war-torn country. The European Commission plans to borrow up to $160 billion to ramp up investments in armed forces. The proposal was approved by EU countries that rely heavily on the US and NATO for defence. They urged their ministers to review these proposals on an urgent basis. The European Union's defence summit in Brussels came amid growing fears that Vladimir Putin, knowing that Trump has withdrawn support from Ukraine, may next target an EU country. Besides, Trump's decision vis-a-vis Ukraine has made the EU believe it can no longer rely on the US to come to its rescue. \"Today we have shown that the European Union is rising to the challenge, building the Europe of defence and standing with Ukraine shoulder to shoulder,\" European Council president António Costa said. The EU also said the countries were working to strengthen their own defences. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, presenting to leaders an ambitious €800bn (£670bn) plan to increase European defence spending, said it was “a watershed moment for Europe” and also for Ukraine. Some of this money could be used to extend military assistance to Ukraine, The Guardian reported. “The best security guarantees are the Ukrainians themselves,” Mr Costa said. EU diplomats, however, privately acknowledged that Europe can't fill the gap left by US...",

If you can step in while it's temporarily beaten down, you end up getting more net bang for your buck. With that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three great stocks you might want to add to your portfolio sooner than later, while they're still on sale at sizable discounts. 1. Constellation Brands If you happen to keep your finger on the pulse of the beer business, then you may be a bit wary of buying a stake in Constellation Brands ( STZ 2.74% ) right now. Beer sales in the United States are at a multi-decade low, boding poorly for the company behind brands like Modelo and Corona. Constellation's spirits brands like Casa Noble tequila and Nelson's Green Brier whiskey are also on the defensive, with price and health concerns leading people to consume less of the harder stuff. A recent survey from the marketing consultant NCSolutions suggests 49% of Americans intend to drink less alcohol in 2025, up from 2024's figure of 41%. The punishment, however, doesn't fit the crime. That is to say, this stock's 20% setback since the end of last year (also at least partly fueled by its fourth-quarter earnings miss and guidance that confirms the industrywide headwind) values it at only 13 times this year's expected per-share profit of $13.33, underestimating the prospect of a recovery driven by demand for Constellation's premium products. Analysts seem to expect a turnaround. Despite...",

The unexploded bomb was found in the middle of the tracks overnight during maintenance work carried out in the suburb of Saint Denis, the national SNCF rail company said. The bomb dated from the second world war, the RER B suburban train line wrote in a post on X. The device was found at about 4am on Friday by workers doing earth-moving work near the tracks at a location in the Seine-Saint-Denis département, 1.5 miles (2.5km) from the Gare du Nord. Minesweepers were quickly sent to the site. Bombs left over from the first and second world war are regularly discovered around France but it is very rare to find them in such a population-dense location. All traffic to the Gare du Nord, which hosts Eurostar trains from London as well as high-speed and local services, was closed as Paris police worked to disable the device. The Gare du Nord lies in the north of Paris and is the country’s busiest rail terminal, serving an estimated 700,000 people each day, according to the SNCF. The French transport minister, Philippe Tabarot, told French radio before heading to the scene that teams were “massively mobilised” to deal with the device. He said: “There’s nothing to be afraid of, but there are procedures we have to respect.” Tabarot said the teams were working as fast as possible within a large security perimeter,...",

China's gold reserves were valued at $208.64 billion at the end of last month, up from $206.53 billion at the end of January, central bank data showed on Friday. \"The PBOC's purchases are an important factor underpinning gold, so a continuation of its buying in February could help to build further strength behind the gold price,\" said Frank Watson, market analyst at Kinesis Money. U.S. import tariff fears, their potential effect on global economic growth and inflation as well as geopolitical uncertainty drove gold to a record high on February 24. Bullion rose by 27% in 2024, the most in 14 years. Washington has so far added an extra 20 percentage points on existing tariffs for Chinese goods, with the latest 10-point increment enforced on Tuesday, drawing Beijing's retaliation. China unlocked more fiscal stimulus on Wednesday, promising greater efforts to support consumption and cushion the impact of an escalating trade war with the U.S, while China's state planner said the country would accelerate the annual stockpiling of strategic commodities.

AI could be a game-changer, helping companies reduce costs, become more efficient, and even make major discoveries -- for example, in healthcare, pharma players might create better drugs faster. All of this could result in significant earnings gains for companies that got in on this story in its early chapters. Investors recognize this and realize that they, too, could set themselves up for a win by piling into the strongest players as the technology develops. That's why they've bought shares of companies making critical tools to power AI development or selling these products to others -- and players already applying AI to their businesses. The one negative point, though, is valuations of many surged, pushing them to levels considered expensive. As a result, some investors wondered if the AI buying opportunity was over. But I've got some good news for you today, especially if you're a bargain hunter. While recent market declines haven't been fun for anyone, they have accomplished one thing: They've pushed certain quality AI players into dirt cheap territory, creating a buying opportunity you won't want to miss. It's unlikely that even a period of headwinds such as economic troubles or government policies could derail the long-term prospects of these companies.

Unified super-middleweight world champion Canelo will fight the new IBF champion and mandatory contender William Scull (23-0, 9KOs) on May 3rd in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The celebratory weekend will be jam-packed full of the biggest fights in boxing, with Ryan Garcia, Devin Haney and Teofimo Lopez fighting on May 2nd in New York, and Naoya Inoue on May 4th in Las Vegas. Cinco de Mayo Fight Weekend May 2nd, New York: Ryan Garcia vs Rolly Romero Devin Haney vs Jose Ramirez Teofimo Lopez vs Arnold Barboza Jr May 3rd, Riyadh: Canelo Alvarez vs William Scull May 4th, Las Vegas: Naoya Inoue vs Ramon Cardenas 32-years-old from Cuba, William Scull claimed the vacant IBF strap with a unanimous decision over US-based Russian, Vladimir Shishkin, last October. It was scored 116-112, 116-113 and 115-113, for Scull after a close, tense, tactical match. The reason why the IBF belt was vacant is due to Canelo ignoring his mandatory challenger in favour of fighting Puerto Rican, Edgar Berlanga in September 2025. Canelo was ordered by the IBF to face their No.1 William Scull after defeating Jaime Munguia in May, but chose Berlanga instead and was subsequently stripped of the title.

While there are many checks you can make around the house to stop rats coming in, he said these are the ones that \"stop you from getting an infestation\". To begin, you need to go around your property and see if there are any breaks around your vents. Checking around your gas and electric meters for cracks is also vital, as rats will \"exploit\" any gaps. He explained: \"They'll go up the pipe and into the actual structure of the gas and electric meter and get into the property that way. \"You can also go and check your sewer drains. If the drain covers up, have a look in there for any breaks and gaps around the back of your property. \"Around the back of your property, check for any pipes or any old pipes that have been left empty. So the pipes have been pulled out, but there's a hole and a gap going in that hasn't been re-filled.

        "content": "I still find it hard to believe that automakers won’t be allowed to sell new gasoline/diesel cars in Europe in a mere 10 years. Technically, it’s not an outright ban on internal combustion engines, as the regulation mandates zero CO2 emissions rather than prohibiting ICE outright. In theory, this leaves room for carbon-neutral fuels. However, I find it unlikely that synthetic fuels or hydrogen will gain traction in such a short timeframe. As a result, this highly controversial target will effectively phase out sales of new ICE-powered cars in the 27 EU member states. This week, the European Commission (EC)—the EU’s executive arm—reaffirmed its commitment to the goal first announced years ago: no new cars spitting out CO2 emissions from 2035. Before that happens, emissions will have to go down by 55% by the end of this decade. However, things could still change: \"The Commission will also accelerate work on the preparation of the foreseen review of the CO2 Standards Regulation for cars and vans.\" In the meantime, automakers will receive support to help them meet intermediate targets. The CO 2 goals set for 2025 are around 15% lower than the previous standards introduced in 2021. The change puts many companies at risk of paying huge fines for exceeding the fleet emissions targets. In January, the Volkswagen Group estimated it would have to fork out around €1.5 billion at the end of the year. However, the EC plans to give automakers more time to meet lower CO2 targets.

Dozens of critics on social media ― from all political persuasions ― summed up the video with one word: “Cringe.” The Trump White House responded with its own take on the trend. “Hey @HouseDemocrats, we fixed this for you,” it captioned its version, featuring President Donald Trump and his top aides, that it shared on the Elon Musk-owned X platform, formerly known as Twitter. The text read: “America Chose Its Fighters Last November.” Hey @HouseDemocrats , we fixed this for you! https://t.co/8j9PzwF7l4 pic.twitter.com/ogHTclsu7w — The White House (@WhiteHouse) March 6, 2025 Surprise!

        "content": "Two cadaver dogs from the Kerala Police, along with their handlers, have been deployed to assist in the ongoing rescue operations at the site of the Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) tunnel collapse in Telangana. The cadaver dogs, which can sniff scents of human bodies under surfaces (like debris), were earlier involved in the rescue operation in Wayanad, Kerala, during the landslide in July last year. They will enter the SLBC tunnel today. The officials of the cadaver dog squad held a meeting with Nagarkurnool district Collector Badavath Santosh and officials of the Disaster Management Authority. They made an initial assessment of the situation inside the tunnel on Thursday. As attempts to find survivors and retrieve victims trapped in the rubble escalate, the Kerala Chief Minister's Office (CMO) said that the State Disaster Management Authority received a request from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). On Monday, NDRF Commandant VVN Prasanna Kumar stated that the effort to rescue eight workers who were trapped after the SLBC tunnel collapsed was in progress and operating at maximum capacity. Approximately 300 personnel, including 100 NDRF members, along with SDRF, Indian Army, and Singareni teams, are actively involved in the rescue efforts. \"The main hurdle for us is the TBM (Tunnel Boring Machine), which is a 1,500-ton machine that got damaged inside the tunnel, causing a major problem for us, a NDRF Commandant was quoted by The Hindu.

Originally shared in his cookbook ‘Jamie's Comfort Food’, it includes a “killer” method to bake Yorkshire puddings that are fabulously puffy and crispy on the outside. When prepared as per the chef’s instructions, this recipe serves eight and can be made in as little as one hour. Posting it on his official website, Jamie remarked: “You also need a killer Yorkshire pudding recipe , which I’ve given you here. I’m cooking one batch with the sausages so it's nice and gooey and stodgy, then doing a larger dedicated tray of unadulterated Yorkshire pudding that'll get really tall and crispy.” Ingredients Three red onions Sunflower oil Nine large higher-welfare sausages 14 large free-range eggs 700g plain flour, plus two tablespoons 500ml semi-skimmed milk 450ml Hoegaarden beer or similar A few sprigs of fresh rosemary Two tablespoons HP sauce Optional: one teaspoon wholegrain mustard One organic chicken stock cube Method Begin by heating the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark seven. To prepare the gravy, peel and finely chop the onions. Heat a large pan over a medium flame, adding a splash of oil. Squeeze the filling from one sausage and place it in the pan, then cook for around 20 minutes, stirring occasionally and using a wooden spoon to break the meat into pieces as it lightly browns. In the meantime, arrange the remaining eight sausages in a large baking...",

If it goes ahead, Operation Sky Shield would include aircrafts from the RAF sent to Eastern Europe to monitor a so-called Air Protection Zone over the war-torn region. The defence plan would function separately from NATO and comes after US President Donald Trump 's repeated warnings that he could cut Europe off to face the threat of Russia alone. The protection zone would help to shield key pieces of Ukrainian infrastructure including its nuclear power plants and the battered cities of Lviv and Odesa - but would not operate in eastern regions due to fears of a direct confrontation between Western and Russian troops. Operation Sky Shield was initially proposed back in 2022 but could be revived amid fears that the US will permanently withdraw its support from Kyiv. Military experts believe that the initiative could have a \"greater military, political and socioeconomic impact than 10,000 European ground troops,\" The Guardian reported.

        "content": "President Donald Trump on Thursday renewed doubts over his commitment to the NATO alliance, saying countries that are not spending adequately on their militaries do not deserve defense. \"If they don't pay, I'm not going to defend them,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office. Trump has frequently questioned whether the United States -- by far the biggest military in the transatlantic alliance and ultimate guarantor of Europe's security since World War II -- should continue its central role in NATO. The Republican, who began his second term in January, doubled down on his criticism that some NATO members do not spend enough on their defense budgets and overly rely on the United States. \"They should be paying more,\" he said. Trump was responding to reporters after NBC News reported earlier Thursday that he is considering a plan to calibrate US military support in a way that favors member countries which spend a higher proportion of more of their GDP on defense. The president has previously called for allies to lift annual defense spending to five percent of GDP from the current two-percent target, which NATO expected only 23 of 32 members to meet last year. Countries deemed to be underspending might not be defended if attacked, according to the reported plan. The move would weaken NATO's core Article 5 which stipulates that any member attacked will be defended by all the others. Trump also questioned whether allies, including France, would defend the United States. \"If the...",

He assured them, “We love you, and we’re coming to get you.” Trump criticised the Biden administration, suggesting the astronauts had been left there too long. He also made a comment about NASA astronaut Sunita Williams' hair. “I see the woman with the wild hair. She’s got a good, solid head of hair,” Trump said. Discussing their return, he quipped, “I hope they like each other up there. Maybe they’ll fall in love.” Trump claimed he had given Musk approval to retrieve the astronauts. “I asked Elon if he could get them. He said yes. He’s preparing his Starship now,” Trump stated. He even joked about joining the mission himself. A live feed showed the upper stage tumbling before losing signal. Footage online captured debris falling over the Bahamas. “We lost contact with the ship,” SpaceX spokesman Dan Huot confirmed. He compared it to a similar failure in January. This was Starship’s eighth orbital test. The rocket lifted off from Boca Chica, Texas, at 5:30 p.m. (2330 GMT). Earlier launch attempts on Monday and Wednesday had been scrubbed.",

SUBSCRIBE NOW! The situation unfolded when umpire Ajitesh Argal notified Harmanpreet that the slow over-rate meant only three fielders were permitted outside the circle for the final over of UPW's innings. Visibly displeased with the decision, she engaged in a short discussion with the official, while her teammate Amelia Kerr also participated in the conversation. Harmanpreet was also involved in a confrontation with UP Warriorz player Sophie Ecclestone when the latter, positioned at the non-striker's end, approached the umpire to communicate something. Harmanpreet responded assertively, apparently directing Ecclestone to not involve herself in the discussion. The situation required intervention from square-leg official N Janani and UP Warriorz skipper Deepti Sharma, who worked to ease the building tension. Subsequently, UP Warriorz posted 150 for 9, which Mumbai Indians chased down successfully, reaching the target in 18.3 overs.",

The controversy erupted when the Amar Singh Chamkila actor appeared in a chat with host Rannvijay Singha for Mashable Middle East, discussing their early job experiences. Rannvijay shared that he worked as a construction worker in New York during his student days, prompting Parineeti to respond with a remark that has since gone viral. “Oh fab...mine is not so embarrassing,” she said, a statement that quickly drew sharp criticism from fans and social media users who labeled her “classist” for seemingly dismissing construction work. The clip, which surfaced online on 7 March 2025, shows Rannvijay asking Parineeti if she ever took up part-time gigs while studying. After he mentioned his construction job, her reply caught attention, and his follow-up was firm: “Well, mine isn’t embarrassing either.” The exchange has fueled a heated debate, with netizens slamming Parineeti for what they see as an elitist attitude. “She lacks talent, good looks, charm or even basic decency. And yet she is being talked about,” one user posted. Another added, “I don’t know who told her that construction is an embarrassing job. If anything, it’s one of the most accessible jobs amongst Indian immigrants (especially Punjabis) within the West.” A post shared by Mashable Middle East | A Fork Media Group Co.

It comes as she came forward for the first time following the Charity Commission's stinging report, but was grilled relentlessly by the host and his co-star, Kate Garraway . Captain Sir Tom Moore captured hearts nationwide with his fundraising efforts for the NHS by walking around his garden. His valiant effort amassed close to £40 million, earning him a knighthood for his charity work. However, his daughter Hannah faced criticism after revelations that she personally gained from the Captain Tom Foundation in her role as director, alongside the now ex-trustee Colin Ingram-Moore. The regulator outlined a \"pattern of behaviour\" leading to personal gain for both parties. They also refused to contribute any part of the £1.47 million made from three books about Captain Sir Tom, despite initial promises of donations to the cause. Speaking on Good Morning Britain, she conveyed: \"Of course, my mother died a long slow death of dementia and that's why my father came to live with us ... He died in a very public way.\" She remarked: \"As I walk around, there are many people that talk about my father and the loss in my life. People weren't able to discuss loss. The headlines were very negative, and we lost control of any sense of the truth. I had to bury my own grief.\" Rob Rinder questioned her about...",

In the third episode of ' The White Lotus ' Season 3, the actor liberates a bunch of caged, venomous snakes , resulting in his character's girlfriend Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood) getting bitten before being rushed to the hospital, reports 'Variety'. But in real life, Walton was the one bitten by a snake. The actor, who plays miserable Thailand tourist Rick Hatchett on the HBO series , told the story on ' Jimmy Kimmel Live ', prefacing it by saying, \"I am terrified of snakes. I don't just have a phobia, it's like a missing link when it comes to snakes. There's something, like, genetically wrong with me when it comes to snakes\". As per 'Variety', the scene, which takes place at a snake sanctuary of sorts, required the actor to open various terrariums and pick up the snakes to let them free. A snake handler on set gave him a rundown on which of the reptiles were fine to touch, and which \"could kill you\". \"For Rick Hatchett, the snakes represented him, and metaphorically speaking, he was releasing these snakes because he wants someone to release him from his pain,\" Goggins said, setting up the scene. \"That meant nothing on the day. When I picked up the snake for the very first time, I started crying uncontrollably\". When he was pulling one of the snakes out, it \"didn't want to come\", lunging toward him and biting him. \"I wish I could have been...",

Well, if you have been in a situation like that, Amazon Prime Video is now testing a new way to fix that, it will use AI to help dub movies and shows into different languages. Prime Video already has a massive library of movies and TV series from around the world. But the problem is, many of them never get dubbed into other languages. Dubbing—where voice actors record new dialogue in a different language—takes time, effort, and money. So, a lot of great content remains out of reach for people who don’t speak the original language. To solve this, Prime Video is rolling out AI-aided dubbing for some movies and shows that wouldn’t normally get dubbed. It’s starting small, with 12 titles, including El Cid: La Leyenda, Mi Mamá Lora, and Long Lost. Right now, the AI-assisted dubs will be available in English and Latin American Spanish. So, how does it work? This isn’t just AI doing all the work. Humans have collaborated with AI to make it possible. The AI helps create the dubbed voices, but professionals check and refine the final product to make sure it sounds natural. The idea is to make more content accessible without sacrificing quality. Prime Video says this is just another way they’re using technology to make movies and shows more enjoyable for everyone. They already offer subtitles, captions, and audio...",

Speaking after a National People's Congress meet, Mr Wang said \"making the dragon and elephant dance is the only right choice\". He also said, \"Supporting, instead of wearing each other down, and strengthening cooperation, instead of guarding (against) each other, is in our fundamental interests.\" He also declared that if Asia's two largest economies were to combine, the \"democratisation of international relations and development and strengthening of 'Global South' will have a brighter future\". India has not yet responded to this statement. However, on Thursday Foreign Minister S Jaishankar said the Indian government is working with China to plot \" a more predictable and positive course \" for the relationship, measures for which will include resumption of pilgrimages to sites under China's control, direct flights, and exchange of journalists. Today, in a response to a question about evolving ties with Delhi, Mr Wang also pointed to \" positive strides \" over the past year, referring to military disengagement in Ladakh's Depsang and Demchok.

        "content": "JERUSALEM -- The Trump administration’s cuts to USAID have frozen hundreds of millions of dollars in contractual payments to aid groups, leaving them paying out of pocket to preserve a fragile ceasefire, according to officials from the U.S. humanitarian agency. The cutbacks threaten to halt the small gains aid workers have made combatting Gaza’s humanitarian crisis during the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. They also could endanger the tenuous truce, which the Trump administration helped cement. USAID was supposed to fund much of the aid to Gaza as the ceasefire progressed, and the Trump administration approved over $383 million on Jan. 31 to that end, according to three USAID officials. But since then, there have been no confirmed payments to any partners in the Middle East, they said. The officials, who have survived multiple rounds of furloughs, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. Two senior officials at aid organizations confirmed they have not received any of the promised funds, after spending millions of dollars on supplies and services. They said they could not afford to continue aid operations indefinitely. Some organizations have already reported laying off workers and scaling down operations, according to internal USAID information shared with the AP. That could imperil the ceasefire, under which Hamas is supposed to release hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Israel releasing Palestinian prisoners and ramping up the entry of humanitarian assistance....",

        "content": "Observing the activity of an individual brain cell in humans for the first time, scientists have found that neurons can differentiate objects or people regardless of the contexts in which they were encountered for the first time. The findings can help understand how humans develop abstract thinking, the researchers, led by those at the Hospital del Mar Research Institute in Spain, said. This behaviour of an individual neuron, described in a paper in the journal Cell Reports, allows for the forming of higher and abstract concepts in the brain, which constitutes the basis of human intelligence, they said. Abstract thought, or perceiving an object in ways not physically visible, is a higher-order form of thinking, examples of which include using metaphors and analogies. The skill has varied applications, such as understanding the big picture. The researchers explained that studies in animals have shown significant differences in how a neuron behaved in response to a concept — a specific place or object — when the context changed. For example, neurons in a rat responded very differently if it found the same object in different locations. It was believed that such memories were stored in different groups of neurons. The findings of the latest study, involving nine epilepsy patients in Argentina and the UK, contradicted the findings from the previous ones: the neurons were found to respond to a specific concept in the same manner when the context changed — such as remembering...",

Last year in conversation with GamesRadar, Rick Hoffman shared, \"I would return to that show in a heartbeat because it's the job that changed my entire life and it was such a wonderful experience. So of course I just hope that whatever, if they did it, it would match up to some of those seasons that were stellar. It was the role of a lifetime.\" Deadline Hollywood reported that Rick is expected to return for one episode in Suita LA as of now. However, if the season is renewed for a second season, he might be present as well. Series creator Aaron Korsh mentioned earlier, \"Harvey is not the only Suits original character that we're going to see this season. There will be at least one other original Suits character. I'm not going to say at what level.\" A new episode of Suits LA is aired on NBC, every Sunday, at 9 PM. Fans are eagerly waiting for Gabriel Macht aka Harvey Spectre to make an appearance soon.",

Speaking about the importance of financial independence, the actress shared, \"I realized years ago that money is power . It's not just about earning-it's about being in charge of your finances. You need to decide how to spend, save, invest, and grow your money because financial control gives you the strength to take on life unapologetically and fearlessly. Too often, especially for women, financial dependence keeps them stuck in situations-whether an unhappy marriage or a job that stifles their passion. Many are unable to chase their dreams simply because they haven't taken charge of their finances. I believe financial independence is empowering and essential for everyone, but even more so for women.\" The 'Dirty Picture' actress also reflected on her journey toward financial independence and the pivotal moment that changed everything. \"When I was getting married, my father handled my finances. He told me, 'Now that you're getting married, let your husband take care of it.' I asked, 'Where do I fit into this? Why won't you trust me to manage my own money?'

Yoon, 64, will not be released immediately, his lawyers said, as prosecutors have seven days to appeal the ruling. The prosecutors’ office did not immediately comment. Yoon has been in custody since his arrest on Jan. 15, when he became the first sitting president of South Korea to be detained on criminal charges. A previous effort to arrest him failed after an hours-long standoff at Yoon’s official residence in Seoul between his security service and authorities. South Korea, one of the most vibrant democracies in Asia and a key U.S. ally, has been in political turmoil since Dec. 3 when Yoon, citing “anti-state forces,” declared martial law before rescinding the order six hours later after lawmakers voted to reject it. Lawyers for Yoon have been pressing for his release, arguing that a second arrest warrant seeking to extend his detention after an initial period of 48 hours was illegal due to procedural issues. The Seoul Central District Court said it was canceling that Jan. 19 warrant because it was filed after the expiration of the 48-hour period. It also cited legal issues with the investigation, which involves two separate agencies. Suk Dong-hyun, a lawyer for Yoon, said the ruling “affirms that the rule of...",

The NHRC representatives were briefed about the campus unrest following the death of Prakriti Lamsal , a third-year Computer Science student at KIIT. Led by Registrar (Law) Joginder Singh, the NHRC inquiry team spent approximately five hours at KIIT University campus, where Lamsal was found on February 16 evening. They spoke with the deceased's friends, hostel mates, and KIIT officials allegedly involved in misconduct with Nepalese students. The team's investigation includes examining reported attacks on Nepalese students by institute staff, with findings due by March 10. The investigation follows a complaint...",

        "content": "The UK’s Eurovision entry for the 2025 competition has been unveiled as pop trio Remember Monday, who will perform their original song “What the Hell Just Happened?”. Originally called Houston, Remember Monday formed while members Holly-Anne Hull, Lauren Byrne and Charlotte Steele were at sixth-form college in Farnham, Surrey, where they would perform cover songs. Specialising in three-part harmonies, they first set out as a country-pop group, citing influences including the Dixie Chicks, Taylor Swift , Dolly Parton , Linda Rondstadt and Alison Krauss. However, “What the Hell Just Happened?”, which chronicles the aftermath of a messy night out, leans more into the pop sphere, with Eighties pop and rock influences and bombastic production redolent of 2024’s breakout star Chappell Roan . It was written by the group with songwriting duo Billen Ted (Tom Hollings and Sam Brennan), Thomas Stengaard and Julie “Kill J” Aagaard. Billen Ted have previously worked with acts including Little Mix, Anne Marie and MNEK, while Stengaard is known for writing Denmark’s 2023 Eurovision winner “Only Teardrops”. The group said: “‘What The Hell Just Happened’ is exactly how we’re feeling right now! It’s all very surreal; our friendship goes so far back, and we definitely never imagined that we’d be doing anything like this.” They continued: “When you’re a kid and people ask you what you want to be when you grow up, an absolute classic is ‘I wanna be a pop star’, so the fact that we’re getting the...",

The Kim Jong Un administration rolled out severe lockdown measures after Covid appeared in 2019, cutting the country off from the rest of the world by closing the borders, halting trade with China and banning fishing, allegedly leading to mass starvation. Human Rights Watch and Transitional Justice Working Group claimed Pyongyang implemented excessive and unnecessary measures to tackle Covid that made the \"already isolated country even more repressive\".

North Korea is accused of carrying out public executions in villages and prison camps . Pyongyang denies allegations of such systematic violations.

Harvey Elliott , coming on as a substitute, made an immediate impact by scoring the decisive goal with his first touch. However, it was Alisson Becker's heroics in goal , making a record nine saves, that truly secured the Reds' victory. Looking ahead, Liverpool will welcome PSG to Anfield for the second leg of their Champions League round-of-16 tie on Tuesday night. If they advance, a quarter-final clash against Aston Villa seems likely following Unai Emery's team's 3-1 triumph over Club Brugge. Yet, the PSG squad is far from defeated . Convinced they should have emerged victorious in the first leg, several of Luis Enrique's players are determined to overturn the deficit at Anfield, doubting Liverpool's ability to best them once more.

Here are some of the key topics covered during his Friday press conference. China has clashed frequently with the Philippines over ownership of and access to islands in the South China Sea, whose rich fishing grounds China claims virtually in its entirety. However, Wang was quick to place blame elsewhere, saying Manila was being manipulated by forces “outside the region,” its standard term for the U.S. Wang called the entire conflict a “shadow play,” saying an unidentified regional official had used the term at a recent meeting, and said each incident was a “line of script” disseminated by the foreign media with the goal of “smearing China.” “China will continue to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in accordance with the law. When managing Second Thomas Shoal and Scarborough Shoal, we will also reflect our humanitarian spirit according to actual needs. But I want to make it clear here that infringement and provocation will inevitably bear its own fruit, and those who are willing to be chess pieces will eventually be discarded.” Wang also said that Chinese cooperation with its neighbors had eliminated many of the compounds where Chinese nationals, many of them coerced or lured...",

The issuing of the certificates follows last month's announcement of more than $300 million investments by Apple in Indonesia, including on plants making components for its products and a research and development centre. Indonesia banned iPhone 16 sales last year due to Apple's failure to meet requirements on locally-made components. Apple was granted certificates for 11 phone models and 9 tablets because it had met the requirements, ministry spokesperson Febri Hendri Antoni Arief said. The company now needs permits from the communications and digital ministry and the trade ministry to be able to sell its products in the country, Febri added. Apple, Indonesia's communications ministry, and the trade ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Indonesia's industry minister had said the months-long negotiations with Apple had been tricky.

The rule change has been introduced for the 2025 running of the legendary race in a bid to improve on-track entertainment. The Monaco Grand Prix is a difficult weekend to digest from a fan's perspective. Qualifying is undoubtedly the session of the year and is enough on its own to warrant the race having a spot on the calendar. There is no sensation like watching F1 cars zip through the streets of the Principality on low fuel, holding nothing back as they flirt with the barriers. Sundays, however, are a different matter. Once the leader exits Sainte-Devote on lap one, there is typically little room for change in the running order. Only fortunately-timed safety cars, driver errors, or strategic blunders can shake up the field. To combat this, F1 and the FIA have approved a unique rule change for 2025. Teams will have to carry out two mandatory pit stops during the race, preventing everyone from bolting on hards during the early stages of the Grand Prix and running to the end without issue. According to Hamilton, this rule change was his brainchild. \"I'm pretty sure that was my idea anyways,” he said. “But if you go back and look at some of the transcripts of previous years, I've been mentioning the two stop for years. “I think Monaco has to be at least a two-stop. The one-stop was never really great. That [Monaco] Grand Prix is a great Grand Prix,...",

In a conversation with actress Mindy Kaling, Meghan publicly corrected her on the name and further highlighted the importance of a shared family surname. Sharing her two cents on the matter, royal expert Jennie Bond noted that while some critics argue Meghan should not use the Sussex title, she is entitled to do so, following a long-standing royal tradition. Bond explained that royal brides, including Sophie Wessex, have used their titles as surnames, and even Prince William and Prince Harry previously adopted ‘Wales’ in their military careers. \"She’s perfectly entitled to use the name Sussex, just as other royal brides have adopted part of their titles as a surname, for example, Sophie Wessex,” Jennie told The Mirror. “It's all rather confusing really, especially as titles change, either when someone dies or a new title is bestowed,” she added. The expert continued, \"The official royal surname for the late Queen’s descendants is Mountbatten-Windsor. But Prince George and his siblings were actually called Cambridge at school, and now Wales. Harry and William adopted the surname Wales in their military careers. \"So Meghan is quite within her rights to adopt a married name of Sussex and also use this for the children. “I don’t think she’s particularly trying to cling to her royal connections - more that she is celebrating the bond with her husband...",

Days after announcing that FBI spin-offs FBI: Most Wanted and FBI: International would be drawing to a close with their current seasons , the network has revealed its axed SWAT – for the third time. The series, which stars Shemar Moore and focuses on the Los Angeles Police Department, was previously cancelled in 2023 and 2024, but received surprise renewals. However, the show’s luck has run out with Deadline reporting this latest cancellation is “permanent”. The 2024 decision was believed to be an unceremonious one made due to budget concerns, without alerting the show’s creators Aaron Rahsaan Thomas and The Shield ’s Shawn Ryan. After the duo and their producing team spoke with the network, SWAT was renewed for a seventh season, with an eighth following in 2024. The news follows what has been a bloodbath at CBS this week, with FBI fans left distraught over the sudden end of Most Wanted and International . Fortunately, the shows have a few episodes left to shoot, so will receive series finales as opposed to ending on a cliffhanger, which was a fate suffered by the cancelled NCIS: Hawaii in May 2024. The reason for the glut of axings is reportedly due to an influx of new shows, including a Blue Bloods spin-off starring lead Donnie Wahlberg and a fresh FBI spin-off titled FBI: CIA . FBI fans aren’t happy with the development. “I knew one would be cancelled to make way for FBI:CIA...",

The Holy See had on Thursday evening reported the pontiff's condition was \"stable\" for the third day in a row, with no repeat of the respiratory crises that have punctuated his time at Rome 's Gemelli hospital. It then released an audio recording made earlier in the day in which Francis, breathless, thanked those who have been praying for his recovery.

Thank you,\" he said, taking laboured breaths as he spoke in his native Spanish. It was the first time the world has heard Francis's voice since he was admitted to the Gemelli hospital, which has a special suite for popes on the 10th floor, on February 14. - 'Good sign' - Pilgrims have been gathering in St Peter's Square at the Vatican every evening to pray for the pope's recovery, and hundreds of people there on Thursday applauded when they heard his message. \"We were very happy that he could speak,\" said John Maloney, a 76-year-old English pilgrim. \"It's a good sign that he's actually able to speak,\" he told AFP, adding: \"He's got a long way to...",

The statement is in reference to actor Anil Kapoor's character in the movie where he becomes the Chief Minister and takes action against corruption. According to Ms Gupta, winning the Chief Ministerial post was not a \"lottery\" but an honour for all the daughters of the country. \"I felt like the protagonist of the 'Nayak' movie. I won't say it was a lottery. It is an honour of all daughters in the country and PM Modi has realised the vision of women-led development and women-led government,\" she said at the India Today Conclave. Ms Gupta became BJP's fourth Delhi Chief Minister and its second woman leader to hold the post. She is also the fourth woman Chief Minister of Delhi, following the BJP's Sushma Swaraj, the Congress' Sheila Dikshit, and the AAP's Atishi, her immediate predecessor. Underlining that the women in Indian society do not get opportunities to go on the \"front foot\", she said, \"The appointment of a woman as chief minister was a very significant vision of the party and PM Modi and it was not just a symbolic facelift but a genuine effort to promote women to higher posts of decision-making.\" The Chief Minister also assured to develop Delhi into a modern city and work to strengthen the basic facilities across...",

I have asked Elon (Musk), I said, ‘Do me a favour.

There’s no kidding, there’s no games with her hair.” Williams (59) and Wilmore were originally on an eight-day mission to the ISS aboard Boeing’s Starliner in June 2024. However, technical problems, including helium leaks and thruster malfunctions, made the Starliner unsafe for their return. On bringing back the two Starliner astronauts, Trump said, “They have been left up there. I hope they like each other, maybe they'll love each other. I don't know. But they've been left up there. Think of it.\" Trump said SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is “right now preparing a ship to go up” and get them.

It is a low-impact yet highly effective cardiovascular exercise that increases the intensity of a regular walk without adding excessive strain on the joints. Incline walking enhances endurance, burns more calories, strengthens muscles, and improves heart health. To get started, begin with a slight incline, gradually increasing it as your strength improves. Keep reading as we list some of the many benefits of walking on an incline.10 Reasons why one should consider walking on an incline1. Burns more calories than regular walkingIncline walking increases calorie burn by 50% or more compared to walking on a flat surface. The body works harder to push forward against gravity, leading to greater energy expenditure, which is beneficial for weight loss and fat burning.2. Strengthens leg muscles and glutesWalking on an incline engages the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves more than walking on flat terrain. This helps tone and strengthen lower-body muscles without the need for high-impact exercises like running.3. Low-impact yet high-intensity exerciseUnlike running or sprinting, incline walking reduces joint stress while still providing an intense workout. It is an excellent option for those with knee pain, arthritis, or recovering from injuries.4.

At the U.S. National Coffee Association annual convention in Houston this week, attendees said they have been in shock at a 70% increase since November for Arabica coffee futures on the ICE exchange, the benchmark for coffee deals around the world. Renan Chueiri, director general at ELCAFE C.A. in Ecuador, said this year is the first time the instant coffee maker hasn't sold all of its expected annual production by March. \"We would usually be sold out by now, but so far we sold less than 30% of production,\" he said. \"The big price increase eats clients' cash flow, they don't have all the money to buy what they need.\" The coffee price hikes have stemmed from lower production in important coffee growing regions, particularly in top grower Brazil, reducing the availability of beans. \"Nobody wants to be exposed, nobody is buying for future delivery, it is all hand to mouth,\" said one coffee broker, asking not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. Many recent deals in Brazil, he said, have been conducted in a very conservative manner. \"You close a deal, and then you have seven days to go to the farm or warehouse and get your coffee. You check the quality, and if it is ok, you make the payment on the site and drive away with the coffee.\" A recent Reuters poll...",

Without spoiling anything about the series, it’s a historical drama that dives into the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, exploring its aftermath through a fictional lens. Directed by Ram Madhvani, known for Neerja and Aarya , The Waking of a Nation centers on Kantilal Sahni, a lawyer played by Taaruk Raina, who uncovers a supposed conspiracy behind the massacre while serving on the Hunter Commission. Alongside him are his friends Ali Allahbaksh (Sahil Mehta), Hari Singh Aulakh (Bhawsheel Singh), and Hari’s wife Poonam (Nikita Dutta), with British actors Alex Reece and Paul McEwan portraying colonial figures like General Dyer. The series’ ambition to tackle a pivotal moment in India’s freedom struggle is laudable, and it can possib;y be an enjoyable watch for history buffs, courtroom drama lovers, and anyone interested in India’s past. The performances are well executed, especially by the main cast. The series even avoids the pitfall of casting terrible British actors who keep talking in Hindi even though they clearly do not know or understand the language. But, problems start when we talk about the narrative structure. It is quite evident that the writing here is contrived. First off, whenever you watch a show or film based in colonial India, the good and bad guys are obviously clear. Almost everyone watching will be siding with the natives as they’re the ones...",

Twinkle Khanna sported a white wig, Gandhi cap and a pink salwar suit in the video. On first glance, it may seem funny and light-hearted but the underlying meaning is rich and truly invaluable. This skit pointed out one of the unspoken issues many women struggle with on a daily basis, celebrating self-achievements. Women sometimes hesitate to unconditionally celebrate their achievements.

'Bengaluru is a world player' The Bitcoin chief said that the city is “not just India's hub but a world player” and that it was ranked 21st worldwide. “Bengaluru is no sleeper. It is a launchpad drawing eyes from Silicon Valley to Shenzhen,” Palombo said. For the second reason, he said Bengaluru is a “tech talent hub”. “Over 100,000 engineers graduate yearly, powering 400+ R&D centers—Samsung’s biggest outside Korea, Intel’s AI labs. It is why 80 per cent of India’s global IT offices land here—a talent goldmine built over decades,” he noted. He noted that Bengaluru ranks third globally based on the number of tech startups it hosts and accounts for 57 per cent of India's startup funding in total. Bengaluru has also raised $31 billion (nearly ₹ 2.7 lakh crore) in the last 10 years. Breeding ground for unicorns Indian unicorns like Flipkart and BYJU's started in Bengaluru, along with several other decacorns.

Newsweek has emailed both the Chinese and Taiwanese defense ministries for comment. Why It Matters Communist China has long claimed that Taiwan , which is a democracy and a U.S. security partner, is part of its own territory, despite never having governed the island. Beijing has also warned that it \" reserves all options \" against Taiwan, which includes the use of force. Admiral Samuel Paparo, head of U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific region, said the Chinese military held the largest invasion rehearsal around Taiwan in his career last summer, while Marco Rubio , U.S. secretary of state, said Beijing will move on the island before 2030 . What To Know During the AFA Warfare Symposium on Tuesday, which was held in Aurora, Colorado, Brigadier General Anthony Mastalir, commander of the U.S. Space Forces Indo-Pacific, gave his opinion on the Chinese military drills, Air & Space Forces Magazine reported. \"It is clear in the increasing complexity with which the [Chinese People's Liberation Army ] exercises are done in a way, that it becomes very difficult, and will become very difficult, to discern an exercise from an invasion,\" Mastalir was quoted as saying. China has deployed military aircraft and naval ships around Taiwan on a daily basis for patrols and exercises, exerting pressure on the island. In...",

However, Motilal Oswal's report suggests that historical data indicates markets tend to stabilize after such corrective phases. Investors should focus on high-quality, fundamentally strong stocks, particularly in the large-cap space, to navigate ongoing market turbulence.While midcap and smallcap valuations have moderated, they still trade at a premium, warranting a cautious approach. A disciplined, long-term investment strategy focused on quality businesses will help investors capitalize on opportunities that emerge from the current market correction.Here’s a further peek into Motilal Oswal’s insight on the markets:Valuation reset but divergence persistsAccording to the Motilal Oswal report, the Nifty-50 now trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18.6x, reflecting a 9% discount to its long-term average.

The 12 people have been charged with a range of offences ranging from misconduct in public office, bribery and conspiracy to commit offences and includes former city politician Derek Hatton. The dozen are due to appear in Preston Magistrates Court on March 28 and range in age from 29-77. Anderson led Liverpool City Council from 2010 and was elected in 2012, serving as the city’s first directly elected Mayor until 2020. He has been charged with one count of bribery, one count of misconduct in a public office and one count of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office.

        "content": "M ore than a century ago, jazz’s early improvisers rarely strayed far from the secure consensus of a tune. That is, until the bebop revolutionaries of the 1940s started blowing impromptu ideas that often sounded better than the pop songs whose chords they borrowed. Post-1960s, free improvisation took themes and variations on epic, extemporised journeys that sometimes never returned to their starting point. Michael Wollny , the 46-year-old German pianist/composer, has long been familiar with the implications of that rapid evolution, and his powerful decade-old trio with David Bowie’s Blackstar bassist Tim Lefebvre and punk-to-postbop drummer Eric Schaefer has become one of the world’s most skilfully free-thinking contemporary jazz groups. Now comes the exceptional Living Ghosts, a live recording of one night on tour in Germany in 2024 that shows just why Wollny refers to the group’s recent concerts as “seances where the ghosts of the trio’s songbook visit us at their will”. There’s no setlist, no agreed arrangements or forethought about which tunes might be made to segue into each other or for how long. Two night-themed miniatures by Alban Berg and Paul Hindemith are recast in racing solo piano streams, bowed-bass sweeps, a tramping rock-drums pulse, and then flat-out postbop over Lefebvre’s fast bass-walk. The harmonic implications (though only barely the tune) of Duke Ellington’s In a Sentimental Mood give way to the lovely pop-song melody of Jon Brion’s ballad Little...",

        "content": "China’s crude oil imports over the first two months of the year fell 5% on 2024 as the parting round of sanctions that the Biden administration imposed on Russian energy affected international flows. The total that China imported over the first two months of the year came in at 83.85 million tons, according to a Reuters , which translated into an average daily import rate of 10.38 million barrels. A year ago, the average daily was 10.74 million barrels. Natural gas imports also slowed during the first two months of the year, by a sizable 7.7% to a total 20.31 million tons in pipeline flows and LNG imports. A relatively warm February contributed to the weaker demand, which led to China slipping to the global number-two spot in LNG imports, overtaken by energy-hungry Japan. In addition to the weather, demand in China was also weaker due to lower industrial activity and ample gas in storage. Crude oil imports into China also declined last year, for the first time in some 20 years, excluding the pandemic lockdown period. The daily average stood at 11.04 million barrels, down by 1.9% from 2023. The 2023 figure, however, was an outlier with record imports of 11.28 million barrels daily. The import growth rates of the last 20 years are unlikely to return as China’s economy moves to a more measured pace of growth as it matures. Both China’s state energy giants CNPC and Sinopec have predicted peak oil demand growth on the horizon, with CNPC forecasting it for this year and Sinopec...",

        "content": "A couple’s holiday to the Canary Islands was ruined after airport staff misinterpreted a post- Brexit passport rule. Grant Hardy and his wife were travelling from Guernsey to Tenerife in February when they were stopped by an airport official who said Mr Hardy’s passport was not valid for travel. The passport, issued in March 2015, expires in October of this year, giving it eight months of validity beyond the couple’s return date. You can travel until your passport is ten years old (in this case, March 27), as long as it has at least three months left on it when you return. But a Swissport official applied a reportedly ‘non-existent rule’ and told Mr Hardy that his passport was no longer valid for travel, leaving the couple stranded in Jersey. The couple had to spend several hundred pounds on flights home and miss their holiday, bringing their total losses up to about £4,000. Their travel insurance did not cover the incident. Mr Hardy claims the Swissport official called the police when he asked to record their response after showing them Government guidance on his passport’s validity. He says he was calm and polite, with the police officer shaking his hand at the end of their encounter. A Swissport spokesman said: \"Our teams adhere to official travel document guidelines to ensure compliance with the entry restrictions of the destination. We have investigated this incident and the decision to deny boarding was in line with the available guidance on Schengen rules.\" But Mr...",

The company is leaning heavily on artificial intelligence (AI) to elevate the user experience even further, and it's having an incredible amount of success. With that said, after recently setting a new record high, Duolingo stock is coming off a rough month in February with a decline of 14%. The sell-off in the broader stock market was one contributing factor, but the company also reported its financial results for 2024 on Feb. 27, and while they were strong, its guidance for 2025 points to slowing revenue growth. Should investors treat the recent dip as a buying opportunity? Duolingo is leaning heavily on AI Duolingo ended 2024 with a record 116.7 million monthly active users (MAUs), which was a 32% increase from the prior-year period. A record 9.5 million of them were paying a monthly subscription, up 43% year over year. The platform uses a freemium business model, so it monetizes most users by showing them ads during their lessons, while a small (but rapidly growing) portion pay a monthly subscription to unlock additional features and accelerate their learning. AI is playing a key role in converting free users into paying ones. In 2023, Duolingo launched its Max subscription tier, which introduced new AI-powered features, including Explain My Answer and Roleplay. The former provides users with...",

Dubbed the world’s most powerful launch vehicle, Starship tumbled, spinning out of control, and exploded with a fiery re-entry within minutes. The lift-off began at 6:30 ET from the company’s rocket facilities in Boca Chica, Texas. During the live stream, a SpaceX spokesperson cheekily stated, \" Unfortunately, this happened last time too, so we've got some practice now.” This is the second test mission in 2025 since January’s eight-minute flight, which ended in a similar explosion and a rain of debris over the Caribbean Islands. The SpaceX’s Starship Flight 8 was earlier cancelled moments before the launch three days ago. The mission failure also ended up being a disaster for its satellite deployment demonstration. Meanwhile, not dismayed by the failure, SpaceX took to X/Twitter and remarked that, “ With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today’s flight will help us improve Starship’s reliability .” The aerospace company stated that it will conduct a thorough investigation of what went wrong with the launch. Earlier, the company used the term “ rapid unscheduled disassembly .” However, the Mechazilla caught the super-heavy first-stage booster that lifted the 5,000-ton Starship to space.

Economists had forecast that exports would rise 5% year-on-year and that imports would edge higher. China’s overall trade surplus grew to $170.52 billion in the first two months of the year. China’s customs agency typically publishes combined trade data for January and February to avoid any distortion from slowdowns during the week-long Lunar New Year holidays. “Export growth cooled over the first two months of 2025, with tariff front-running providing less of a boost to demand than we had anticipated,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics . “This slowdown comes before any substantial hit from tariffs, which will almost certainly lead to sharp falls in shipments to the U.S. before long,” he said. Evans-Pritchard said that the slowdown in imports suggests that the pick up in demand driven by government stimulus spending late last year has “already partially reversed.” This week, U.S. President Donald Trump 's second of two 10% hikes in tariffs on imports from China took effect and that is likely to hurt Chinese exports in coming months. To a certain extent, buyers and Chinese suppliers had rushed to beat those increases in import duties. Chinese officials have slammed the tariff increases but also expressed confidence that the economy is resilient and that...",

According to Variety, sources at CW have confirmed that the footage is real, though it was never turned into a final trailer before the project was scrapped. At the time of its cancellation, the network may have been preparing a promotional video, but insiders claim the leaked footage would not have met CW’s quality standards. Since CW sometimes worked with outside companies to create trailers, it is possible that the leak originated from a rejected version created by a third party. Some also speculate that it might have been a Warner Bros. TV trailer intended for events like San Diego Comic-Con. The leaked footage quickly spread across social media, showing a reimagined version of the beloved superhero trio. Bennet played Blossom, Cameron portrayed Bubbles, Perrault took on the role of Buttercup, and Faison starred as Professor Drake Utonium, the scientist who originally created the Powerpuff Girls.

'Tareef kum, aur tariff pe baat kijiye (talk about the tariffs issue and less about your praise),\" Ramesh said in an interview with PTI. Ramesh indicated that the Congress would address Trump's reciprocal tariff threats in the upcoming Budget session's second half, advocating for a unified approach to counter these challenges. The Budget Session's second phase commences Monday and concludes April 4. Ramesh also took a jab at external affairs minister S Jaishankar, claiming he speaks more like an American representative than an Indian minister. Ramesh criticised Trump's approach to international trade, noting that the established WTO framework, negotiated with 170 countries, is being disregarded in favour of Trump's individual interpretation of trade relations. \"'You tariff, I tariff', that is not the way international trade functions. These rules have been negotiated. The WTO is World Trade Organisation not World Trump Organisation,\" he said. Ramesh also expressed concern over the deportation of illegal Indian immigrants from the US, noting that while smaller nations voice their concerns, India's...",

You know it happened once, are forever being warned it could again, but so far... well, actually, let’s not go jinxing anything just now. The point is that though while James famously played part of his teenage loan spell at Wigan in the middle of the park, and has been touted as having the skill set to transition ever since, it is an option almost no Chelsea manager has used. In turning to it twice in the last fortnight, Enzo Maresca has already done so more often from the start of matches than all of his predecessors combined. Following a trial in the 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa last month, James was again stationed at the base of midfield here in Copenhagen, and from there strode forward to drive the opening goal in his side’s Conference League victory by the same score . In both instances, you suspected the Englishman’s redeployment was a case of needs must. With Romeo Lavia injured, Cesare Casadei, Carney Chukwuemeka and Renato Veiga all sent out on loan, and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s Chelsea career so far a non-event, Maresca has few options beyond his first-choice pair of Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez. At Villa Park, with his forward line so depleted, Maresca tried to compensate by strengthening in midfield, starting James alongside both Caicedo and Fernandez in a rarely-seen three. Here in the Danish capital, James playing 90 minutes allowed the overworked pair...",

While these narratives hold value, they risk redundancy. A more compelling perspective lies in how women can strategically navigate their unique relationship with risk, understanding their financial boundaries and willingness to embrace uncertainty, to formulate an investment roadmap that drives success. This is not merely about participation; it is about redefining the framework.Risk capacity: the cornerstone of strategyRisk capacity refers to the financial resilience an investor can maintain without jeopardizing essential goals. For women, this often reflects a broader context—balancing roles as providers, caregivers, or both—where decisions impact not just personal wealth but household security. A professional with a robust safety net has greater leeway for loss than, say, a single parent with limited reserves. This is not risk aversion; it is a pragmatic assessment of one’s fiscal boundaries.Investment strategies must begin here. A woman with high risk capacity might allocate 70% of her portfolio to equities, confident in her ability to absorb volatility. Another, with tighter constraints, might prioritize fixed-income assets for stability. Tailoring a portfolio to this...",

Henry has been key to New Zealand's hopes in the 50-over tournament and returned figures of 5-42 against India in a dead-rubber group match that the Black Caps lost. \"We've had some scans and stuff done on him and we're going to give him every chance to be playing in this match,\" Stead said on Friday. \"So still a little bit unknown at this stage.

By comparison, Walmart ( WMT -1.40% ) generated revenue of $181 billion, marking the first time it ever came in below Amazon. For what it's worth, Walmart still took the top spot for the year. The company grew its revenue by 5% year over year to $681 billion, which was well ahead of Amazon's full-year net sales of $638 billion. However, considering Amazon is growing roughly twice as fast as Walmart right now, it's likely that Amazon will pass Walmart on a full-year basis in 2025. Here's what Amazon has done to take away Walmart's crown and what it will keep doing in the coming years to stay atop the world of retail. What's driving Amazon's growth? Sales on Amazon's website are the largest part of the business, and this is what many people think of when they think about the company. But it's important to note that its biggest growth is occurring elsewhere in the business. For starters, Amazon sells things on its website but enables third-party sales, as well. When it comes to facilitating third-party sales, the company makes money with things such as commissions and fulfillment fees. In Q4, this was a $47 billion revenue stream, jumping 9% year over year and helping it move ahead of Walmart. Additionally, Amazon's advertising business is one of its fastest areas of growth.

From mopping floors and washing dishes to picking up his wife from work, he takes on responsibilities typically assigned to women in conventional households. But his contribution doesn’t end there. To support his family further, he also works as a Swiggy delivery partner at night, balancing fatherhood, housework, and financial support seamlessly.

The announcement was met with both shock and disgust, but the truth turned out to be quite different.

It's not actually real.\" Mr Yardy, whose real name is Nicholas Hunter, says he has been in a relationship with both women for nearly two years. While the pregnancies were fake, Mr Yardy maintains that his unconventional relationship with both Jade and Dani is real. Born in Jamaica, Mr Yardy launched his social media career in 2017 after spending a year in jail for a marijuana conviction. Since then, he has made a lucrative living by creating skits and content with OnlyFans models and internet personalities. Jade, a fellow content creator, has built a substantial online following, including an OnlyFans presence that she claims has helped her purchase a Florida restaurant.

The group, who previously reached the quarter-finals of The Voice, will head to Switzerland this May with a song called What The Hell Just Happened? Calling themselves \"pop girlies with a little bit of yeehaw\", the band was formed by school friends Lauren Byrne, Holly-Anne Hull and Charlotte Steel in 2013. In a press release, they said: \"We're going to be the first girlband to represent the UK since 1999, which feels like such a crazy honour. We're going to bring loads of fun, energy and hopefully do something that you won't have seen before on the Eurovision stage.\" Premiering their song on BBC Radio 2, the band added: \"We feel like we're on another planet. Nothing is sinking in.\" They'll be hoping to improve on Olly Alexander's performance at last year's Eurovision Song Contest. His song, Dizzy, took 18th place after receiving the dreaded \"nul points\" in the public vote. He was only saved from last place by the jury vote - where professional musicians and songwriters awarded him 46 points. But the former Years and Years star shrugged off the loss with typical good humour. Playing at Radio 1's Big Weekend Festival a month later, he introduced Dizzy as \"the 18th most popular song at Eurovision.\" Remember Monday's song is markedly different from the decadent electro-pop of Dizzy. In fact, it's in an entirely different realm. Try to imagine, if you can, that Abba and...",

One of the few female coaches to have broken that convention in football is among those who wants things to change. Packed stadiums, increasing professionalization and a 50/50 athlete gender split at the Paris Olympics — the growth in women's sport is visible. But while the pace of change in a few sports has picked up, decades of underfunding, prevention of opportunity and sexism are taking some time to unpick in a broader sense. That's particularly true in leadership positions, such as coaching. While equality was achieved at the 2024 Olympics for athletes, it was far from the case for those tasked with improving them. Though the International Olympic Committee (IOC) have not released data, most estimates put the percentage of female coaches in Paris somewhere around the same level as the Tokyo Games three years earlier, 13%. It's a pattern repeated across the sporting landscape — just over a third of coaches at the Women's football World Cup in 2023 were women — and female coaches in men's sports are exceptionally rare.

Alfred, due to make landfall early on Saturday , has already brought heavy rain and left nearly 82,000 homes across the Gold Coast and the New South Wales without power . It has also forced Brisbane to halt all public transport and prompted the city airport to suspend operations. People living in the projected path of the cyclone have been asked to “act now” and evacuate before the situation gets worse. Prime minister Anthony Albanese has urged the public to “be sensible” after TV footage captured surfers riding massive swells and people walking along the shoreline. “This isn't a time for sightseeing or for seeing what it's like to experience these conditions firsthand,” he said. “Please stay safe.” Forecasters expect the cyclone’s projected path to go through Byron Bay , close to where several celebrities have their homes. Meteorologists have cautioned it could bring destructive winds of up to 120kmph, life-threatening flash floods, and 8m waves. American rapper Ice Cube said on Thursday he was stuck inside his hotel in Australia , joking that the local beach could be “in the lobby” at any minute. “It is pretty cool, I haven't been through a cyclone before.

The North Carolina Senate advanced measures this week amplifying recent GOP-backed laws eroding powers of Democratic executive branch officials. Emboldened by Trump's 3-point victory in November — his third in battleground North Carolina — Republicans approved a bill Tuesday that would force some law enforcement agencies who report to Gov. Josh Stein to cooperate with federal immigration agents . That would include having the State Bureau of Investigation, Department of Public Safety and adult correction system officially participate in the 287(g) program, which trains officers to interrogate defendants and determine their immigration status. Republican lawmakers in over a dozen states this year have filed legislation seeking to require or incentivize cooperative agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural . The bill also would direct Stein’s budget office to determine if immigrants in the country unlawfully are wrongly receiving state benefits. Another measure given tentative approval Wednesday will prevent the attorney general — former U.S. Rep. Jeff Jackson , now in Stein's old job — from challenging any...",

Despite over 3,500 PAs and anaesthetic associates (AAs) currently employed within the health service, researchers found a significant gap in studies examining their roles. Published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), the review highlights the absence of research into safety incidents related to PAs. Furthermore, existing studies suggest PAs face challenges when working in general practice settings. Researchers also cautioned about the limited scope of some studies, noting that one key piece of research on PAs in GP surgeries only included data from seven PAs. They also warned that “conflating absence of evidence of safety incidents...with absence of safety concerns when physician associates directly substitute for doctors is an error of logic that is likely to cost lives”. While some research has suggested PAs could support the work of hospital ward teams and A&E when appropriately deployed and supervised, “the number of individuals and settings studied was small, and those findings should be considered preliminary”, the team said. Furthermore, the researchers found some NHS staff had concerns about the competence of PAs and AAs “to manage undifferentiated, clinically complex, or high dependency patients... or prescribe”. The review continued: “No evidence was found that physician associates add value in...",

        "content": "Proposed changes to the tax-free allowance for cash Individual Savings Accounts ( ISAs ) could affect over a million people in Scotland, the Scottish National Party ( SNP ) has warned. The party has slammed the speculative plans, calling them a \"tax on savers\" and urging that there be no cuts to the allowance in the Chancellor's spring statement later this month. SNP economy spokesman Dave Doogan MP said: “The Labour Party must ditch its damaging plans to impose a punishing new tax on savers, which would clobber more than a million Scots and could cost many households hundreds or thousands of pounds.” Research from the House of Commons Library shows that 25% of adults in Scotland hold cash ISAs, equating to around 1.12 million people. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is reportedly considering lowering the annual contribution limit for cash ISAs from the current £20,000 to just £4,000, with some speculation that the allowance could be cut entirely. Cash ISAs allow savers to earn interest without paying tax, and the proposed changes could see savers losing out. The SNP has claimed that under the new limit, savers could lose up to £5,132 in taxes over five years, assuming a 5% interest rate and annual deposits of £16,000. Ms Reeves has previously spoken about fostering \"a culture of retail investing\" similar to the United States, aiming for better returns for UK savers. However, Mr Doogan argued that this move contradicts promises made by the Labour Government not to raise taxes on...",

Pope Francis has released an audio message thanking well-wishers around the world who have been praying for his recovery, his first public sign of life since he was hospitalised three weeks ago. The short, two-line message was recorded by Francis on Thursday from Rome’s Gemelli hospital and broadcast to the faithful who had gathered in St Peter’s Square at the Vatican for the nightly recitation of the rosary prayer. Recommended Stories “I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your prayers for my health from the square, I accompany you from here,” the pope said, speaking softly in his native Spanish and with laboured breaths. “May God bless you and the Virgin protect you. Thank you.” Pilgrims had been gathering in St Peter’s Square every evening since the 88-year-old pontiff’s hospitalisation on February 14 . The hundreds of people there applauded when they heard the message. On Friday, the Vatican said the pope had a “calm night” of rest and woke up just before 8am. Francis was initially diagnosed with bronchitis but this developed into pneumonia in both lungs, requiring continuously evolving treatment and prompting alarm across the globe. Double pneumonia is a serious infection that can inflame and scar both lungs, making it difficult to breathe. The pope has not been seen in public since entering hospital, his longest such absence since his papacy as head...",

China on Friday vowed to retaliate against the United States for its “arbitrary tariffs,” accusing Washington of unfairly penalizing Beijing despite China’s cooperation on key global issues. Speaking at a press conference Friday on the sidelines of China’s annual parliamentary session, foreign minister Wang Yi criticized the US for implementing punitive tariffs while benefiting from China’s assistance in tackling its fentanyl crisis . Why it matters The US recently imposed new tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico over accusations of fentanyl smuggling. Beijing, which has repeatedly asserted that it has taken substantial steps to curb the export of fentanyl precursor chemicals, views the latest tariffs as unjustified. The escalating trade measures mark a continuation of economic hostilities that have intensified since US President Donald Trump ’s return to office. What they are saying “No country should fantasize that it can suppress China and maintain a good relationship with China at the same time,” Wang said. “Such two-faced acts are not good for the stability of bilateral relations or for building mutual trust.” Wang also criticized Washington’s approach to international cooperation, warning that a self-serving strategy could lead to global instability. “Small and weak countries will get burnt first, and the international order and rules...",

It was observed that butter consumption can increase the risk of early death by 15 percent. The study did a comparison between butter and plant-based oils, and it was observed that there is a winner when it comes to increasing lifespan. While butter can bring down your lifespan, consumption of plant-based oils can reduce mortality risk by 17 percent. The researchers added, “It is well established that substituting saturated fatty acids with unsaturated fatty acids and eliminating trans fatty acids confers substantial health benefits, particularly in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

Given the 10% levy imposed by the US that came into effect last month, Chinese exports to the U.S. are set to face duties of up to 20% at least. During Trump's first terms, tariffs valued at nearly $380 billion had been imposed on Chinese products. Later, towards the end, both parties conciliated and inked a deal to redress the issue of trade deficit. Under phase I of the US-China trade deal in 2020, Beijing had pledged to increase imports from Washington to the tune of $200 billion over a span of two years. However, Trump, after beginning his second stint as President, has now indicated that he wants to put the Phase I deal back on the table to give US businesses equitable access to the Chinese market. 'Unreliable Entities' The issue of trade deficit looms large even five years later. In 2024, Washington's imports from Beijing stood at $438.9 billion, an increase of 2.8% compared to 2023, according to statistics compiled by the US Trade Representative's office. On the other hand, Chinese imports from the US were $143.5 billion in 2024, a decrease of 2.9% from the previous year. Thus, last year, America's trade deficit in goods with China was $295.4 billion. In response to America's actions, China has announced 15% tariffs on wheat, corn, cotton and poultry, in addition to 10% duties on soybean,...",

The government has launched the national supervised toothbrushing campaign in a bid to \"revive\" the country's oral health. Teeth health can vary significantly between poorer and more affluent areas of England, data shows. Figures reveal the most common reason children aged five to nine are admitted to hospital is to have treatment for decayed teeth. One in four children aged five have experienced tooth decay in England, with higher rates of up to one in three in more deprived areas. The new scheme will be rolled out in early years settings such as nurseries and schools and children will be encouraged to brush their teeth with a fluoride toothpaste.

With that as the backdrop, if you've got a couple thousand extra bucks -- or any other amount of money -- you're ready to put to work producing immediate income, here are three top-notch dividend stocks to consider buying. 1. British American Tobacco There's little doubt that anti-smoking activists are winning the war against tobacco usage. But not as much or as quickly as you might think. Even within the United States, where the cessation effort is gaining the most traction, data from the CDC indicates that nearly 1 of out every 5 U.S. adults is a regular tobacco user. And the movement's progress is slowing even more outside of the U.S. The World Health Organization reports there are still roughly 1.25 billion smokers worldwide, versus 2000's count of 1.36 billion. Moreover, the organization predicts there will still be almost 1.2 billion smokers come 2030. In other words, while the tobacco business as it stands isn't exactly growing, it's probably going to be around for a long, long while longer. Enter British American Tobacco ( BTI 1.21% ) , which isn't nearly as \"American\" as the name implies.

But certain Wall Street analysts see the drawdown as an opportunity to buy shares of Tesla ( TSLA -5.61% ) and The Trade Desk ( TTD -2.34% ) Dan Ives at Wedbush recently set his bull-case target price on Tesla at $650 per share. That implies 136% upside from its current share price of $275. Ives expects demand to improve and the Trump administration to fast-track its entrance into the robotaxi market. Chris Kuntarich at UBS recently raised his target price on The Trade Desk to $148 per share. That implies 124% upside from its current share price of $66. The stock fell sharply after a disappointing fourth-quarter report, but Kuntarich says the sell-off was overdone. Here's what investors should know about Tesla and The Trade Desk. Tesla: 136% implied upside Tesla disappointed investors in the fourth quarter. Apart from recording its first decline in annual deliveries, revenue increased only 2% to $27.5 billion, operating margin contracted 2 percentage points, and non-GAAP earning increase only 3% to $0.73 per diluted share. Tesla has now missed Wall Street's consensus earnings estimate in five of the last six quarters. Tesla narrowly maintained its leadership in electric vehicle sales last year, but it slipped to third place behind Chinese automakers BYD and Geely in January 2025. Unit sales declined by a...",

And while tacking on AI to the name feels out of place for a gaming handheld, the experience largely has been very positive. With a bigger 8-inch display, longer battery life, and Intel’s improved Core Ultra 200V “Lunar Lake” chip, the Claw 8 AI+ makes a strong case for itself in an increasingly competitive gaming market.The bigger screen makes it easier to get lost in sprawling RPGs, high-speed racers, or open-world adventures, though some may find the increased size a bit unwieldy. In addition to better drivers and performance stability from Intel, MSI has also upgraded the joysticks and bumpers for a more responsive feel and improved thermals with the new Cooler Boost Hyper Flow system. The Claw 8 AI+ stands out with a clear performance advantage—roughly 10-15% better than its closest AMD rivals in many modern AAA titles.At $899, the Claw 8 AI+ sits in premium territory and may make you think twice about getting this handheld or putting that cash towards one of the best gaming laptops. But for those who love playing their favorite games on the go, this is shaping up to be one of the best handheld gaming consoles of 2025.MSI Claw 8 AI+: Cheat sheetWhat is it?

Also read | Aspirin can reduce risk of heart attacks, strokes in pneumonia patients: Study In the study, published in Nature, the scientists say that discovering the mechanism will support ongoing clinical trials, and could lead to the targeted use of aspirin to prevent the spread of susceptible types of cancer, and to the development of more effective drugs to prevent cancer metastasis. Studies of people with cancer have previously observed that those taking daily low-dose aspirin have a reduction in the spread of some cancers, such as breast, bowel, and prostate cancers, leading to ongoing clinical trials. However, until now it wasn't known exactly how aspirin could prevent metastases. Also read | Can aspirin reduce risk of second heart attack? What cardiologist says In this study, led by researchers at the University of Cambridge, the scientists say their discovery of how aspirin reduces cancer metastasis was serendipitous. They were investigating the process of metastasis, because, while cancer starts out in one location, 90% of cancer deaths occur when cancer spreads to other parts of the body. The scientists wanted to better understand how the immune system responds to metastasis, because when individual cancer cells break away from their originating tumour and spread to another part of the body they are particularly vulnerable to immune...",

        "content": "Actress Neetu Chandra has taken legal action against rapper Yo Yo Honey Singh, filing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Patna High Court over his latest track, Maniac . The song – released as a bonus track as a part of Honey Singh’s album Glory – has sparked controversy for its explicit lyrics and visuals, which Neetu claims degrade women. The PIL, lodged on 6 March 2025, also names singer Jazzy B, the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), and several government bodies, demanding accountability for content that she alleges promotes misogyny. Neetu, known for roles in films like Garam Masala and Traffic Signal , argues that Maniac portrays women as mere “sex objects” and could harm societal values, especially among the youth. “The song Maniac from the album Glory objectifies women and has obscene lyrics and visuals,” her petition states. She’s pushing for strict action, including a potential ban on the song, and has called out the CBFC for certifying it without proper scrutiny. “The CBFC failed to do its job by allowing such content to pass,” the PIL asserts. The PIL also states, “Women should never make the mistake of treating anyone as an object because insulting a woman has always resulted in painful consequences.” In fact, the PIL also mentions other artists who have collaborated with Honey Singh on the song, including lyricist Leo Grewal and Bhojpuri singers Ragini Vishwakarma and Arjun Ajanabi. The case is likely to have a hearing later this month. Neetu...",

Ukrainian news website Militarnyi reports the disconnection was the result of Trump stopping the flow of intelligence to Ukraine . The satellite blackout applies to both government and personal users, the outlet reports. Maxar has been approached for comment via email. The firm has provided commercial satellite images for Ukrainian users showing the movement of Russian troops, and they've also been used to show the aftermath of attacks in the occupied territory and within Russia , the outlet reports. These images have also been a key resource for analysts covering the conflict. It follows the explosive bust-up between Trump and Zelensky in the Oval Office on Friday, with appearing to be visibly rattled as Zelensky sought to communicate the threat Putin poses to Europe and the US. The meeting soon descended into chaos as Trump and his VP JD Vance berated Zelensky, accusing him of being ungrateful for the billions of dollars in aid that Washington has provided to Kyiv since Putin's invasion began in February 2020.

The selection of the country-inflected female trio – who describe themselves as “pop girlies with a lil bit of yeehaw” – was announced by Scott Mills on his Radio 2 show this morning. Remember Monday participated in series eight of The Voice in 2019, where their performances included a cover of Seal’s Kiss from a Rose. They also appeared on the US TV show of their Voice mentor Jennifer Hudson in January 2024, covering Alanis Morissette’s Hand in My Pocket . Their selection as the UK’s participant has not been a well-kept secret. In February, the Radio 1 presenters Natalie O’Leary and Vicky Hawkesworth devoted a segment of their show to discussing Remember Monday’s status as the official act, saying: “They’re so good. They are going to be representing us in Eurovision this year.” The presenters likened their musical direction to that of Beyoncé’s album Cowboy Carter , talking up their chances because “country is having its moment”. The day before the announcement, the song also appeared to be circulating online, with numerous Eurovision fan sites linking to a 20-second snippet. Some sources also claimed that merchandise themed to the song’s title had appeared briefly on Remember Monday’s Spotify account before disappearing, sharing screenshots that seemed to show branded tops.

        "content": "Coventry Building Society has reported a drop in its annual profits after seeing mortgage costs reduce, as it kicks off merging with The Co-operative Bank after buying the rival lender at the beginning of the year. The building society, which is the second largest in the UK behind Nationwide , made a pre-tax profit of £323 million in 2024, down from £474 million the prior year. It said it generated less income during the year due to the impact of mortgage costs coming down, as UK interest rates were cut, while savings customers moved money into higher interest-bearing accounts. This dragged on the group’s net interest margin – the difference between what a bank generates from loans and pays out to savers. But the building society saw mortgage and savings balances grow through the year, which it said was partly driven by offering competitive rates to members and incentivising savings. Coventry’s chief executive Steve Hughes said it grew savings and mortgage balances in an “uncertain environment, with the UK economy experiencing more persistent inflation and higher interest rates than many believed to be the case at the start of the year”. The building society completed the £780 million acquisition of rival lender Co-op Bank at the start of 2025. The tie-up created a banking giant with millions of customers and an estimated £89 billion worth of assets. It returned the Co-op Bank to a mutual structure, meaning it is owned by individual members rather than shareholders and...",

The Swedish forward has been on United’s radar for months, and his connection with manager Ruben Amorim, who coached him at Sporting Lisbon, fueled speculation of a summer reunion. However, Gyokeres is determined to play at the highest level in Europe, which could derail United’s plans. United’s struggles this season have left them far from securing a top-four Premier League finish. Even if Amorim sparks a late turnaround, qualification for next season’s Champions League through league position seems out of reach. Their only remaining hope lies in winning the Europa League , but that path is far from guaranteed. Gyokeres has been in sensational form for Sporting Lisbon, scoring 37 goals in 39 games.

That is the crux of Nadaaniyan , a passably lively but spectacularly shallow rom-com produced by Dharmatic Entertainment for Netflix. The strictly superficial buoyancy that the film seeks to exude is as affected as the idea that the plot revolves around. Directed by first-timer Shauna Gautam from a script by Riva Razdan Kapoor, Ishita Moitra and Jehan Handa, Nadaaniyan sputters to life only intermittently, banking on the youthful charm and energy of the young lead actors. The film juggles sundry ideas from Karan Johar's early blockbusters ( Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, K3G , et al) and updates them, without much originality, for the consumption of Gen Z social media addicts who would rather die than go off the grid. The film places aloo-gobhi in opposition to squid ink pasta, plays off Noida natives against Ivy League aspirants and sets up a flippant love story around a brainy, career-minded boy and a poor little rich girl whose parents dote on her but with a dispiriting degree of condescension. Naadaniyan appears to address serious themes couched in frivolous narrative methods - patriarchy, family prejudice against a girl child, class divide, friendship and ambition. But with its tone being steadfastly glib, its well-meaning postulations do not quite hit home. Debutant Ibrahim Ali Khan and Khushi Kapoor (in her third...",

Robbie Hummel, a former Purdue player, believes that Indiana should pursue Creighton’s Greg McDermott. Here is Hummel’s reasoning behind why he thinks the Hoosiers should ink a deal with McDermott: \"I like [Greg] McDermott,” Hummel stated. “And maybe that’s biased because I’ve seen so much of Creighton, but I love their offense. It’s modern. They shoot a ton of threes. He’s won with – not that Creighton has bad resources, but fewer resources than what Indiana has. He’s a really good coach. I think his demeanor is perfect for that. He’s a great guy.” Hummel raises an important point when it comes to NIL. If McDermott has been able to win consistently at Creighton, the sky’s the limit at Indiana, especially with one of the top NIL funds in college basketball....",

Market experts including Bhatia were speaking at Moneycontrol’s Global Wealth Summit as a part of the panel titled: “Finding the next multi-billion-dollar titans: The growth-valuation conundrum” Bhatia noted, \"More women working means more women earning and spending on themselves. That changes consumption patterns significantly. Women traditionally managed household finances, but their spending behavior is different when they earn their own money.\" According to Bhatia, convenience is a key factor in this shift, influencing markets like quick commerce, e-commerce, and home gadgets. \"It's about making life easier at home, whether through electronic gadgets, personal mobility solutions like scooters and compact cars, or personal well-being products,\" she said. She pointed out that fashion and beauty alone form a $110 billion market, with beauty products accounting for just $20 billion but projected to reach $90 billion by 2027. \"We have seen these trends take off in markets like South Korea and the U.S., and they are now taking hold in India. These are major shifts, and a lot of investment opportunities will emerge from this space,\" Bhatia added. Managements rather than themes would be a better focus area, according to Utpal Sheth,...",

Speaking from the Oval Office on Thursday whilst signing executive orders, Trump discussed Canada's high tariffs, particularly noting their 250% charge on American dairy products and significant levies on lumber, despite America's abundant timber resources. Trump indicated that whilst current tariffs are \"temporary\" and \"small ones\", the primary reciprocal tariffs starting April 2 will significantly impact the country's trade relationships. \"Because we've been ripped off by every country in the world, and now whatever they charge us, they charge us 150-200% (and) we charge them nothing. So whatever they charge us, we're going to charge them, and there'll be no getting out of it. So we look forward to April 2. I've been looking forward to that date for a long time. And that'll be something very big,\" Trump said. This marks Trump's second commentary on India's tariffs in recent days. During his Tuesday address to Congress, his first since beginning his second White House term, he criticised various nations' high tariffs as \"very unfair\".

As per PTI reports, this has led to a new interest in the research on the surface of the Moon and its past, and what this has revealed is that the potential for ice is located in places more than had been imagined. Chandrayaan-3 uncovers possible new ice deposits in several locations The research targets the significant role temperature variations play in the formation of ice. According to lead author Durga Prasad Karanam of Ahmedabad's Physical Research Laboratory, large-scale, localized temperature variations on the Moon significantly impact the formation of ice. These temperature variations are closely related to the properties of the surface of the Moon and the conditions of solar radiation across its surface. The study of the ice particles formed under these varying conditions can potentially provide useful information on the formation of the Moon, its geological history, and the manner in which the processes across its surface have evolved over time. Karanam continued to clarify that through the observation of how ice formed and migrated on the Moon's surface, researchers would learn about early geologic processes that created the natural satellite. The discovery could hold essential information regarding the Moon's past climate and whether it can sustain life. Chandrayaan-3 captures key...",

Levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) - a toxic gas that exacerbates asthma, impedes lung development, and raises the risk of lung cancer - across all of London is estimated to have decreased by 27%, the report found. The zone, which aims to cut pollution by charging drivers of vehicles which do not meet emission standards, was expanded by London's mayor Sir Sadiq Khan to outer London in August 2023. The Labour mayor praised the results while the Conservatives on the London Assembly said the data relied on \"maybes, possibilities, assumptions, and straight up fantasy\". When the scheme was expanded, it sparked protests as opponents said the scheme was rushed and the benefits were not worth the financial cost for those who had to change their vehicles. Opponents also said the changes would have happened anyway as drivers took notice of the existing Inner London Ulez zone. According to the study, which looked at data for 12 months from September 2023, air quality has improved at 99% of air quality monitoring sites across London since 2019, and London's air quality is improving at a faster rate than the rest of England.

China, Russia and the Arab world, however, spent less during the period. But it might be different this time. On March 6, China announced a 7 percent rise in its defence Budget to $245 billion. Beijing's move comes amid rising tensions between the world's two biggest economies over trade, with rhetoric getting shriller by the day. Two days earlier, the European Union proposed to borrow up to 150 billion euros ($157.76 billion) for its rearmament push after Trump stopped aid to Ukraine.

        "content": "An expert has just gotten honest about the chances Meghan Markle would ever have to deal with a stripping down of her Sussex title. The expert in question is royal commentator Phil Dampier and he spoke of this with The Sun. In his chat, Mr Dampier got right to it and said, “I doubt King Charles would like Meghan making references to the importance of Sussex as her name but I’ve always felt he's reluctant to start any process of stripping her and Harry of their titles.” Plus “It would be difficult to do and he doesn’t want to make the rift any worse, hoping one day there might be a reconciliation with his son.” And in terms of where the show itself stands Mr Dampier said, “The show won’t do anything to help mend the rift between them as it’s mainly just drivel about re-arranging fruit and lighting candles,” and the idea is that “at least Meghan is trying to make money out of something else besides criticising the royal family.” In terms of where their personal sentiments stood he admitted, “I’m sure if you asked their spokesmen both the King and William and Kate would say they won’t be watching Meghan’s show but it’s hard to believe they wouldn’t take a sneak look out of curiosity.” Given that “Archie and Lilibet are growing up in the US with American accents and it’s very sad for Charles that he doesn’t really know them or see them.” After all, “he dotes on William and Kate’s kids and I’m sure he would be a loving grandfather to Harry and Meghan’s children if given the...",

        "content": "Elon Musk is reportedly telling Republicans he is not to blame for the firings of thousands of federal workers in a push to downsize the US government. Tesla's CEO has said in private talks this week that those decisions are left to various federal agencies. The message from one of President Donald Trump 's most influential advisers came as Republicans publicly supported Musk's work at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), but privately raised questions as personnel cuts reverberate across the country. Republican Representative Richard Hudson said \"Elon doesn’t fire people\" after a dinner-time pizza meeting with Mr Musk in the basement of the Capitol. Mr Hudson added: \"He doesn’t have hiring and firing authority. The president's empowered him to go uncover this information, that’s it.\" It's a remarkable shift of emphasis away from the chainsaw-wielding tech entrepreneur whose vast power has made him a revered and feared figure in the second Trump administration. The Republican president said on Thursday he has instructed department secretaries to work with DOGE but to \"be very precise\" about which workers will stay or go, using a \"scalpel\" rather than a \"hatchet\". Mr Trump told reporters in the Oval Office: \"I don’t want to see a big cut where a lot of good people are cut.\" He suggested Cabinet and agency leaders would take the lead, but Mr Musk could push harder down the line. The president said: \"If they can cut, it’s better. And if they don’t cut, then Elon will...",

We got a chance tomorrow night to rate the ship and get that win and hopefully build confidence from there.” The Red Wings will have their opportunity to snap the losing streak when they face Alex Ovechkin and the Washington Capitals in their next matchup.

More than 100 witnesses, including members of Maradona’s family and doctors who tended to him over the years, will take the stand over the course of the four-month trial, which starts on Tuesday in the Buenos Aires suburb of San Isidro. Recommended Stories The seven defendants risk between eight and 25 years in jail if convicted. Diego Armando Maradona died on November 25, 2020 at the age of 60 while recovering from brain surgery for a blood clot, after decades of battling cocaine and alcohol addictions. He was found dead in bed at a rented house in an exclusive Buenos Aires neighbourhood where he was brought after being discharged from hospital two weeks after surgery. He was found to have died of a heart attack. The night nurse said he had seen some “warning signs” but had “received orders not to wake him up”. Maradona’s death, which came in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, plunged Argentina into deep mourning. Tens of thousands of people queued to bid farewell to him as his body lay in state in the presidential palace. Who are the main accused?

Bayer has paid about $10 billion to settle disputed claims that Roundup, based on the glyphosate herbicide, causes cancer. About 67,000 further cases are pending for which the group has set aside $5.9 billion in legal provisions. The German company has said plaintiffs should not be able to take Bayer to court invoking U.S. state rules given the federal U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has repeatedly labelled the product as safe to use, as have regulators in other parts of the world. \"Without regulatory clarity (Bayer) will need to exit the business. Bayer have been clear with legislators and farmer groups on this,\" analysts at brokerage Jefferies said in a note on Thursday, citing guidance Bayer's leadership provided in a meeting. Bayer, which acquired Roundup under the $63 billion takeover of Monsanto in 2018, said: \"We are exploring every possibility to end this litigation.\" It declined to comment further. Disclosing glyphosate sales numbers for the first time, Bayer on Wednesday said the product, one of the most widely used weedkillers in U.S. field farming, generated 2.6 billion euros ($2.8 billion) in revenue last year. \"Bayer could reach a point in the future where the company is...",

When stock prices plummet, many investors rush to buy high-quality stocks at a discount, believing in their long-term potential. But what exactly makes certain stocks stand out during downturns?The answer lies in trust and fundamentals. Some investors rely on strong financials, visionary leadership, and robust management when selecting stocks. Others gravitate toward legacy brands that have consistently weathered market turbulence.Take the Tata Group, for example. If any Tata stock were to drop 60% from its recent price, investors would likely seize the opportunity—not just because of valuations, but because of the brand’s reputation and proven resilience. Millions trust Tata, believing that, over time, its stocks will rebound and generate strong returns.As Warren Buffett wisely said: Only buy something that you’d be perfectly happy to hold if the market shut down for ten years. For investors, market corrections aren’t just downturns—they’re windows of opportunity.Introducing quality factor In the dynamic world of investing, quality is a crucial factor that helps investors identify companies with robust business models, efficient management, sustainable profitability, and strong cash generation.

Now it is clear that the team has multiple positional needs that need to be addressed if it is going to make the playoffs for only the second time since 2015. One of its needs is pass-rushing. No one on its roster had more than 5.0 sacks, and an edge rusher who will consistently create pressure on opposing quarterbacks would be a game-changer for Arizona. On Thursday, Cincinnati Bengals star pass rusher Trey Hendrickson asked to be traded, and the Bengals granted him permission to seek a trade. ESPN's Mina Kimes named several teams she expects to call Cincinnati about Hendrickson, and the Cardinals were one of the teams she mentioned. \"With [Trey Hendrickson and DK Metcalf] having a year left [on their contract] that does depress their trade value.\" @MinaKimes spoke on teams she believes should \"be on the phone\" for All-Pro pass rusher Trey Hendrickson📱 pic.twitter.com/0sMsbt5sMe Hendrickson led the NFL with 17.5 sacks and also registered 36 quarterback hits, 19 tackles for loss and six passes defended in 2024, which earned him his fourth straight Pro Bowl nod and his first All-Pro First Team selection. He also finished second in the Defensive...",

        "content": "Indian companies returned the lowest share of their earnings as cash to shareholders in 2024, a trend that reflects both the country’s high-growth aspirations and its corporate governance challenges, according to valuation guru Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at New York University.In his latest analysis of global cash return policies, Damodaran found that Indian firms distributed just 31.1% of their earnings in the form of dividends and stock buybacks—far lower than their global peers. While one can argue that this signals a strong reinvestment cycle fueling long-term expansion, it can also be seen as a symptom of weak shareholder rights and management’s reluctance to part with excess cash.Damodaran noted that among global markets, Indian companies stand out for their reluctance to distribute earnings to shareholders, with payouts trailing significantly behind other regions. With the benign explanation being that they are reinvesting for growth and the not-so-benign reason being poor corporate governance, he wrote. He pointed out that in publicly traded firms, management decides how much cash to return, and in the absence of shareholder pressure, they, not surprisingly, hold on to cash, even if they do not have no need for it. Reinvestment or retention?Damodaran acknowledged that some firms may be holding back cash to fund future growth. “A healthy market is built on cash being returned by some businesses (older, lower growth) and being plowed back into growth...",

Former star Kendrick Perkins took it a step further when he claimed the ball club is “saving the NBA”. This came in the wake of a winning streak sparked by Luka Doncic’s takeover since last month’s groundbreaking arrival from the Dallas Mavericks. Left infuriated, Charles Barkley himself didn’t hold back dismissing Kendrick Perkins for his take. Barkley blasted the big man, and anyone else willing to disagree, during a rant on Inside The NBA. He hit out at a recency bias showing, arguing there is an obvious disregard towards the league’s truest elites. Charles Barkley detonates over Kendrick Perkins’ bold crowning for the LA Lakers It can’t be denied that the entire basketball world directed its spotlight towards Los Angeles upon the Lakers’ blockbuster acquisition of Luka Doncic . Doncic’s brilliance is having an effect already. They have won nine of their last 11 games, allowing them to deliver a dramatic emergence atop the Western Conference as the current No. 2 seed (40-21). With how great the Lakers are right now, most talking heads in the media are busy highlighting the team as the subject of their discussion. And upon the recent statement by Perkins, Barkley immediately got fed up, calling him a “fool” while ripping ESPN in NBA on TNT pregame show on March 6. “He said the Lakers saved the NBA season.

        "content": "A “delicate balance” was seen in the housing market in February, with the average property price dipping by £213 month-on-month, according to an index. Property values fell by 0.1% on a monthly basis, taking the average house price in February to £298,602. Annual house price growth remained at 2.9%, which was unchanged from January. Amanda Bryden, head of mortgages at Halifax , said: “February’s figures highlight the delicate balance within the UK housing market. “While there’s been talk of a last minute rush on new mortgages ahead of the changes to stamp duty, inevitably we’ve seen some of the demand that was brought forward start to fade as the April deadline ticks closer, given the time needed to complete a purchase.” From April, stamp duty discounts will become less generous for some home buyers. Stamp duty applies in England and Northern Ireland. Ms Bryden added: “While house price growth has slowed overall, market activity remains strong and comparable to pre-pandemic levels, demonstrating a resilience amongst buyers that’s been evident in the face of higher borrowing costs. “While those affordability challenges persist, the ongoing shortage of housing supply coupled with sustained demand suggests property prices will continue to rise this year, albeit at a more measured pace compared to last year.” Andrew Montlake, chief executive of Coreco Mortgage Brokers said: “There is no shortage of economic headwinds facing the property market, and affordability is a constant...",

Trump made the wildly incorrect claim and a series of other bold accusations during his speech to Congress on Tuesday (4 March) night. He used the speech to highlight several initiatives he's started in his first six weeks in office . During his address, Trump complained about the amount of money the United States has spent on certain projects under Joe Biden including: “$8m to promote LGBT+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of, $60m for indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian empowerment in Central America. $8m for making mice transgender. This is real.” On his show on Wednesday (5 March), Kimmel pointed out that Trump’s statement about the mice was not true. In his opening monologue, the TV host said: “You know, you hear the president of the United States say we’re spending $8 million to do sex change operations on mice. You say, ‘Well, I’m sure he’s exaggerating, but there must be something there.‘ Turns out there’s not. It’s not real.” Kimmel explained: “The government spent money on transgenic mice, which are genetically modified mice they use in lab tests to study disease. It has nothing to do with being transgender.” Continuing, Kimmel asked: “Other than the word, the ‘trans’ part of the word.

        "content": "Every market euphoria or excess eventually requires a reset, and what follows is often healthier, said Sunil Singhania, founder of Abakkus Asset Managers, while talking about the recent market correction. Drawing an analogy, he shared a personal example—recently shaving his head for healthier regrowth. \"Markets function the same way,\" he explained. \"Once excesses are removed, the growth that follows is far more sustainable.\" Singhania said that India will experience a W-shaped recovery rather than a V-shaped one, as stock valuations remain elevated. India is seeing a correction after a long period of three-to-four years and the correction needed reasons to support it, he said. The reasons for the market correction were disappointing GDP numbers, weak corporate profit numbers, and uncertainty of dollar movement, he said. Singhania said that investors should maintain a constructive outlook. The US represents 4% of the world's population, yet holds 70% of the global market share and 50% of the world's debt. At some point, even a 3-4% capital shift between countries translates into $3-4 trillion in movement. \"If India captures just 5% of that shift, it could bring in $150-200 billion in capital inflows. If that's the case, profit growth will be at least 11.5%,\" he added. On Trump tariffs Singhania added that it was the relevance of Trump tariffs is gone. \"On Monday you said tariffs, Tuesday you said no tariffs, Wednesday you said tariffs, and so on,\" he said.

        "content": "Pakistan cricket team spinner Abrar Ahmed found himself in the headlines after he gave a fiery send-off to Shubman Gill during the Champions Trophy 2025 match against India. Following Pakistan's loss in the encounter, he came under a lot of fire with Wasim Akram slamming him for his gesture. Abrar has now revealed that he teased Virat Kohli during the match and asked him to hit the spinner for a six. Virat was the top performer for India as he slammed a brilliant boundary while Abrar produced a solid performance. In a recent interview, he explained his admiration for the star batter and said that he was excited with the prospect of bowling to Kohli and took the opportunity to tease him. “My childhood dream of bowling to Kohli has come true in Dubai,” Abrar told Telecom Asia Sport. “It was a great challenge and I took the liberty of teasing him, asking him to hit me a six, but he never got angry. Kohli is a great batter, we all know that. But he is a great human being too.” However, Virat's reaction left him stunned. “He said, ‘well bowled' after the match, and that made my day,” he added. “I have grown up idolizing Kohli and used to tell Under-19 players that one day I will bowl to him”. “Kohli's fitness is outstanding. The way he runs between the wicket is eye-catching and that's what makes him a unique cricketer.” The spinner also spoke about his send-off to Gill and said that it was his style and he found nothing wrong with it. “That's my style and I see nothing wrong...",

A tourism boss is warning that “out of control” inflation may seriously impact the island in the upcoming tourism season. Majorca is becoming less budget friendly thanks to its increasing popularity as a holiday destination, causing accommodation, dining and tourist attractions prices to all rapidly increase. And now Juanmi Ferrer, president of the CAEB Restaurants Association, is expressing his concern about the eye-watering costs restaurants are facing. He told the Majorca Daily Bulletin that last year eateries had to absorb price increases to keep customers, but that led to a loss of competitiveness. Mr Ferrer warned that businesses do not want a repeat of the 2024 scenario as forecasts had suggested last summer would be an exceptional one - but in reality turnover was lower than anticipated and there was a drop in productivity. He said: \"Unlike other tourism sectors that have been able to adjust rates upwards, the restaurant sector continues to have difficulties in transferring the increase in costs to final prices. This has generated a stagnation in profitability, with businesses working with increasingly tight margins.\" Visitor numbers are up, but tourists are spending less, he warned. Mr Ferrer said: \"Last year there were many people on the island, but there was less spending per...",

Speaking at an Oval Office event on Thursday, Trump described the upcoming levies as the big one among the many duties his administration has planned.India is expected to be hit particularly hard by these measures due to its high tariffs compared to the US. The comments come as Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal is in Washington for discussions with Trump administration officials on trade policy between the two nations.Trump, known for his strong stance on trade, has repeatedly accused India of imposing unfair trade barriers that hurt American businesses. He has previously called India the biggest tariff abuser and the tariff king. His latest remarks follow a meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump at the White House in February, where both leaders agreed to boost bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. They also pledged to finalise a trade deal by autumn this year. Indian officials hope that ongoing negotiations could help India secure relief from the impending tariffs.Trump has not clarified whether any countries will be exempt from the new duties. However, he has granted major reprieves to Mexico and Canada, exempting certain goods covered under the USMCA trade agreement from his 25% tariffs.In recent weeks, Modi’s government has taken several steps to ease trade...",

The anthology movie also features segments by Imtiaz Ali, Rima Das and Onir. Themed around the four pillars of diversity— sexuality, gender, disability, and race— the anthology film features four unique stories directed by Khan, Imtiaz Ali, Rima Das and Onir. They are inspired by true incidents. Khan's segment, titled “Setara”, brings to life the journey of a 15-year-old Afghan girl, who has come to Melbourne after fleeing the Taliban. She finds her sense of belonging through cricket amid family tensions and past trauma. \"It was an uplifting story because Setara's dream was fulfilled through cricket, and also to show a city with the heart to do this. It's an important story to tell the world that if you see immigrants and refugees with just one perspective, then they'll never be able to contribute to society. \"But if you welcome them and make them feel at home, they contribute to you. In the film, Setara also helps Melbourne, so that's why, for me, it became an important story,\" the director, known for blockbusters such as “Ek Tha Tiger”, and “Bajrangi Bhaijaan”, told PTI in an interview.

A similar trend was observed on Indian exchanges, where platforms like CoinDCX, Giottus, and CoinSwitch reported a five percent decline, with Bitcoin trading around $90,575 (roughly Rs. 79 lakh).“In one of the historical moments yesterday, President Donald Trump has signed the executive orders to establish what people are calling a “Digital Fort Knox” which directs its administration to hold the seized assets from criminal and civil proceedings. The market reaction to this news was a bit negative as people were expecting the US to deploy fresh capital to Bitcoin,” the CoinSwitch Market Desk told Gadgets 360.Ether also succumbed to the market pressure and continued to trade in losses throughout the week. On Friday, Ether price dropped by six percent to trade at $2,168 (roughly Rs. 1.90 lakh) on international exchanges.

The research paper titled ‘Fare-free Bus Travel Scheme for Women: Lessons from Delhi’ by WRI India researchers Harshita Jamba, Aravinda Devaraj, and Chaitanya Kanuri, shows that the scheme --- women passengers can choose to not pay for their travel on state-run buses, those opting for free travel issued a pink single-journey ticket --- primarily benefits women from low-income families with half of the surveyed women saving at least ₹ 500 per month. The researchers, based on a survey that included 28% of respondents from economically weaker sections (EWS) with annual household incomes below ₹ 3,00,000, and an additional 57% from households earning under ₹ 6,00,000, found that the share of female ridership rose from 33% to 42% from 2019-20 to 20222-23, going by the state’s planning department data.

The brokerage warned that if corrective mechanisms are not put in place, the current downturn could mirror past collapses.Using previous crashes as reference points, Ventura’s analysis outlined possible downside scenarios for Nifty. In a severe correction, the index could drop to 20,510—based on a 15x forward P/E similar to the 2020 COVID 19 crash. In an extreme bear case, where valuations mirror the 10.5x P/E seen in 2008, Nifty could plunge to 14,357. A median scenario would place the index at 17,434, implying a steeper correction ahead.The market turbulence can be attributed to a combination of global macroeconomic headwinds, including the reversal of US trade policies, fiscal deficit concerns, and a shift toward onshore manufacturing. Liquidity constraints due to quantitative tightening (QT) have exacerbated the downturn, Ventura said.Adding to investor concerns is the growing risk of a US debt crisis. With government debt...",

US prosecutors have unveiled a new indictment of ‘forced labor’ against the 55-year-old rapper. They claim he forced employees to work long hours and threatened to punish those who did not assist in his sex trafficking empire, which is alleged to have run for 20 years. A trial for Combs is set to start on May 5 in Manhattan . He is facing federal charges of sex trafficking, transportation to engage in prostitution, and racketeering conspiracy. Combs has pleaded not guilty to the charges. “Mr Combs has said it before and will say it again: he vehemently denies the accusations,” his lawyer Marc Agnifilo said in a statement. “He looks forward to his day in court when it will become clear that he has never forced anyone to engage in sexual acts against their will.” Combs has also been hit with dozens of civil lawsuits from both men and women, who have accused him of sexual assault and other misconduct. He has denied all wrongdoing. While the new indictment added no new charges, it described what prosecutors called the \"forced labor\" that Combs demanded in connection with the racketeering conspiracy. It said that Combs and his associates “maintained control” over some employees by forcing them to work long hours with little sleep, through the use of or threats to use physical force, financial harm, psychological harm and reputational harm. \"In doing so, Combs, assisted by...",

The Prime Mininster and French President have called for a \"coalition of the willing\" to protect Ukraine once a deal is reached to end Russia 's war. Australia, Ireland, Luxembourg, Belgium and Turkey have all suggested they would be prepared to offer their soldiers. Denmark, Sweden, and Canada have not ruled out involvement. Some European governments appear more scepitcal but are still keen to play some kind of peacekeeping role. Poland, for example, has said it wants commitments to ramping up NATO's eastern flank before committing troops. Italy has the largest military in Europe, with around 338,000 troops.

It's nine o'clock on a Sunday morning, but in this coffeehouse in central Moscow, the party is just getting started. So-called \"coffee raves\" - an early-morning take on late-night club raves, dominated not by alcohol and drugs but by cappuccinos and macchiatos - are cropping up all across Russia after taking global capitals like Amsterdam, London and New York by storm. Many enjoy the chance to socialise with friends in a party-like atmosphere - without the brutal hangovers that result from traditional drug-dominated nightclub culture. \"I think it's a very cool thing for the community,\" says Marina, a music editor. The event's co-organiser, Alexander Zhiganov, says he wants the parties to feel as fun as big nights out. \"I want to give people an idea that you can listen to great music, gather without alcohol, without drugs, and so on - in a more familiar atmosphere with coffee, delicious food and friends,\" Zhiganov says. Although the crowd on Sunday skewed younger, people of all ages were in attendance, coffee mugs in hand. Some even brought their young children along. \"I think we need to have events like this every day,\" says Alexandra Kovalski, a restaurant manager, who describes herself as \"not a night party animal at all.\" \"I'll be happy to dance in the morning, drink delicious coffee and go somewhere...",

But I am here to implore you to add this German flick to your Netflix watchlist.The movie arrives on Netflix this week (Friday, March 6) and it’s the perfect weekend watch. Initially, it offers a sunny escape to the stunning French countryside, but soon enough things get very twisted.So, if you’ve never heard of ‘Delicious’ (and I'm not hugely surprised, Netflix is currently dedicating all its marketing resources to poor-looking “The Electric State”), or just want a few more details before committing your precious movie-watching time to it, let me give you the full rundown.What is ‘Delicious’ about?Set over an idyllic summer in Provence, France, “Delicious” centers on a German family who own a plush villa in the region. Driving back from a swanky meal out, they accidentally hit a young woman (Carla Díaz) on a dark country road.Fearful she may report the incident, they agree to take her in and hire her as a maid for the summer. Over the next few weeks, the woman, named Teodora, becomes increasingly intertwined with the family.While at first all seems well, husband John (Fahri Yardım) and wife Esther (Valerie...",

So-called health experts once again talk about all of the physical and mental problems that changing the clocks cause in an effort to gain support for just one standard year-round time.Daylight saving time has a long history in many parts of the world. It can be traced in one form or another to ancient civilizations. And the purpose has always been the same: to allow for the enjoyment of longer days of sunlight in the summer. What can be wrong with that?To me, objections to daylight saving time are all a bunch of hogwash. Daylight saving time is the annual ritual that marks the unofficial end of the long, dark winter and the beginning of spring. It allows for later evenings outdoors, long walks, playing catch with the kids after dinner, family barbecues, a quick nine holes of golf starting at 6 p.m. and all of the other activities that draw us away from winter blues and back to the warmth and extended days of sunlight.Change is good. And daylight saving time draws that line between hunkering down in front of the television during cold winter months and getting back to outdoor fun with family and friends. Don’t believe all the noise about the evils of the time change. It represents new life and renewal. It’s a ritual that should be enjoyed. Peter JanoffFee affordabilityHolbrook, L.I.: A...",

Leaders across Europe are echoing the alarm sent out by the European Commission president, and rippling across the continent, Canada and elsewhere: that we face a “clear and present danger on a scale that none of us has seen in our adult lifetime”. She has proposed a plan that would offer €800bn (£660bn) for immediate rearming, with a European sky shield to protect Ukraine. The hooligan Russian asset in the White House has changed everything so profoundly that it is hard to keep track. The US, whose coat-tails we clung to, whose culture we revelled in, whose cleverness dazzled and stupidity confounded, is now the enemy. The shock feels viscerally personal because American culture is deep in our veins at all ages, from Sesame Street to Marvel, from Philip Roth to Philip Glass, the Oscars to Silicon Valley, like it or not. In Iraq and Afghanistan, we obediently followed their blunders, and 642 British soldiers died, as Keir Starmer adroitly reminded JD Vance in parliament. Our glamorous friend has turned fiend. How do we cauterise that off us? Or reconfigure the map of the world in terms of friends and foes?

We are both 36 and happy with our decision. But recently, a lot of our mates have had kids and Peter is struggling with it. I don’t want a child, but I do like them, whereas Peter just doesn’t. My reasons for not wanting children are to do with money, the climate crisis and not wanting to sacrifice my very nice life. But Peter just finds kids annoying and isn’t comfortable being around them. If there are kids playing on a train, he has to move carriages. His tolerance for child-created noise is very low. In the past three years, three couples we’ve known for years have had children, but Peter doesn’t want them to bring their kids when we invite them over. I’ve told him that life doesn’t work like that. Once, a friend had to bring their two-year-old to a child-free barbecue we’d organised because they couldn’t afford a babysitter. Peter later told me the child had “ruined the vibe”. He made it awkward and was noticeably annoyed whenever the child needed attention or interrupted the adult conversation. Our friend left early and we haven’t hung out with them since. Peter can’t accept that his friends have to bring their kids along in some social settings now. If a friend can’t stick to a plan because something’s come up with their child, he won’t say much, but privately he is annoyed. I don’t think he...",

Many people shy away from taboo topics such menopause, menstruation and endometriosis. To help shine a light on these important subjects, we’ve reached out to several top women’s health experts to help debunk some common misconceptions. Here’s 7 things they wish everyone knew about women’s health... 1. Women shouldn’t have to put up with painful heavy periods No woman should have to endure the burden of painful, heavy periods – yet for many, it is an all-too-common reality. “Painful, heavy and irregular periods are not normal and women shouldn’t have to just put up with it,” says Dr Samantha Wild, clinical lead for women’s health at Bupa Health Clinics . “We often see women in our clinics who have suffered in silence from this for years, even to the point where it stopped them from doing their daily routines such as exercising or going to work. “It’s so important to seek help for heavy, painful and irregular periods especially if they are having an impact on your daily life.” 2. Heart disease is not a ‘man’s disease’ Heart disease is frequently mislabelled as a ‘man’s disease’, but the truth is, it affects women just as significantly, often with unique symptoms and risks that go unrecognised. “Heart disease is the leading cause of death in women and coronary heart disease kills more than twice as many women as breast cancer in the UK every year,”...",

So as I was denied access to the clubhouses, that’s fine, I put my shoes on here in a parking lot. I asked two questions only. That was it.“Where was the first tee and what was the course record?

Dharma Productions, having survived a few major hurdles, has done just that with ‘Nadaaniyan’—pairing Ibrahim Ali Khan, son of Saif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh, opposite Khushi Kapoor in a neon-sprinkled, heightened candy-floss romantic dramedy. Unlike the hero of the film, this story gets a passing grade but falls well short of distinction. This is a Gen Z romance with dull comedy and shallow characters peppered throughout a paper-thin plot. A heiress caught between legacy and loneliness ‘Nadaaniyan’ opens with a harried heroine—Khushi Kapoor as Pia Jaisingh—who has to fake having a boyfriend. Her backstory, despite her 3 lakh-plus follower count on Instagram, is elaborate and complicated from a Gen Z point of view. Things at home between her parents (Mahima Chaudhary and Suniel Shetty) are strained. As the daughter of an ultra-wealthy clan whose primary business seems to be law (details like these are left to the imagination), she faces regular taunts from her paternal grandfather. In their glossy, designer-led world, a girl cannot inherit the family business—law. The family seemingly wanted a son.

Orr's driver's license had been updated with a male sex designation while his passport still listed female. Orr was pulled aside for further questioning, and it wasn't until he outed himself as a transgender man that security let him through. Shaken from the incident, Orr decided it was time to update his passport, apply for an expedited renewal, and send along important medical documents like his birth certificate on Jan. 16. A few days later, President Donald Trump took office and signed a sweeping executive order acknowledging only two sexes – male and female – designated at birth. Immediately, the U.S. State Department began to only issue passports \"with a male or female sex marker that matches the applicant's biological sex,\" the agency told USA TODAY in an email. The LGBTQ+ advocate was given two options: withdraw his passport application or receive one with his \"biological sex at birth.\" With his passport now in limbo, he's being forced to rearrange an upcoming trip to Ireland in March for a medical procedure. \"It's very isolating and concerning,\" Orr told USA TODAY. \"Receiving a passport that misgenders me is not just a clerical error; it's a profound denial of my identity and my existence.

        "content": "(Warning: Spoilers ahead) Discovering that Lumon Industries left a town with nothing more to show for itself than an addiction problem is hardly a surprise. Neither is finding out that Harmony Cobel’s (Patricia Arquette) rage is a complex response to early exposure to Kier Eagan’s philosophy. However, Severance delivers another bombshell by disclosing exactly why losing access to the severed floor makes Cobel furious. Cobel is much more than a supervisor and an Eagan fanatic. “Sweet Vitriol” digs into Cobel’s Lumon work history dating back to her childhood, and I was convinced a twist was incoming about her being an illegitimate descendant. The actual answer is (thankfully) more subversive than another branch on the Eagan family tree: Cobel is the true mastermind behind the severed procedure. Since Cobel has been absent since the third episode, having a standalone encounter with her character is much-needed. Cobel was last seen confronting Helena (Britt Lower) in the Lumon parking lot. Before this, the disgraced Lumon employee was on her way to Salt’s Neck, changing her plans to give Helena a list of demands to return to work. “I think you overestimated your contributions,” said Helena. The Eagan heir is probably not privy to the truth, and Cobel’s desire to prove her worth is understandable. Going home is never easy. Salt’s Neck is a husk of a coastal town boosted and then ravaged by Lumon. Everything is the same shade of gray as Cobel’s hair, and it isn’t just the cold...",

Lewis Hamilton ’s move to Ferrari, the Christian Horner scandal and Max Verstappen’s title win all feature in the new season of the popular Netflix docu-series, released on Friday . But Sky Sports F1 pundit Patrick, the former IndyCar and NASCAR racer who appeared in season six, does not feature in the latest season. Instead, Patrick’s Sky colleague Button – the 2009 F1 world champion – features briefly, alongside regular contributors Will Buxton and Claire Williams. Patrick, the only woman to win an IndyCar Series race, is a familiar face to British viewers of F1 in the UK, with the 42-year-old featuring as a Sky pundit at races stateside and beyond. In recent months, Patrick has been vocal in her support for US president Donald Trump, revealing prior to last year’s election that she would vote for the Republican candidate in what would be her first ever vote in a presidential election. Buxton, who is now commentating on IndyCar for FOX , has appeared since the first season while former F1 team principal Williams joined the show last year. Williams, the daughter of Williams F1 team founder Sir Frank Williams, is a regular voice of knowledge throughout the latest 10-episode season. Speaking to The Independent about whether the latest season could be his last on the show given his departure from F1TV, Buxton said: “To be honest with you, I don’t...",

The 'Stranger Things' actor previously fronted indie rock band Calpurnia and performed in pop duo The Aubreys, but he's now going it alone by announcing the launch of his new record 'Happy Birthday' and its lead single 'Choose The Latter'. In a statement, Finn, 22, revealed the album grew out of a challenge he set himself to write 50 songs by the end of 2022. He explained: \"I ended up writing a lot of terrible stuff, but a few of those songs I was really proud of went to the Aubreys. \"I started realising a general theme in a lot of the other songs involving my identity, anxieties, nostalgia, childhood and loneliness. All of that was a part of a bigger puzzle. I knew I wanted to make a record, but I didn’t know with which songs.\" He added of his love of music: \"Music for me has always been something that I can control. And while I’m really grateful for acting and for a long time, it really provided me that peace, it’s just a different thing now that I’m an adult and that it’s a career. \"I still enjoy it a lot, but when I am by myself and get to play guitar and write a song, it’s a different kind of feeling I’m after.\" 'Happy Birthday' is due for release on June 5. Finn is also hitting the road for a series of North American shows which kick off in Los Angeles on the same day he launches the album. Finn's tour will also stop in cities including San Francisco, Portland, Seattle and Vancouver, Canada. The actor previously opened...",

The trailer debuts below. Norwegian docu director Tommy Gulliksen , working alone, was allowed exceptional access to the organization’s inner sanctum through the current Norwegian finance minister and former NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, viewed as “one of the great diplomatic beacons,” as stated by CPH:DOX . Dubbed the “Trump-whisperer” by his fellow NATO colleagues for his ability to engage with the U.S. President during the latter’s first term in office, Stoltenberg was convinced by former U.S. President Joe Biden in 2023 to extend by a year his nine-year tenure as NATO secretary general to make sure the 32 member states would stay united, in the wake of Russia’s war in Ukraine. That period of extreme tension was captured by Gulliksen in a pure vérité style. The 600 hours of raw footage gathered over 22 months was then mixed with archive material and assembled into this 100-minute film. As Stoltenberg tries to stick to his promise made to president Volodymyr Zelensky that NATO will stand by Ukraine “for as long as it takes,” Gulliksen’s camera immerses us in the power play between leaders of this world. Maëlle Guenegues of sales outfit Cats & Docs, which just acquired international rights to “Facing War,” says “the film is remarkably...",

Before watching the new movie , it’s unclear just how many copies of him we’re going to see, each binned off after being sent on a life-threatening errand in the name of space science. Then there’s the story itself. In true Joon-ho style, we’re not getting through this without scathing commentary and enough off-the-wall ideas to leave you dumbfounded, so the idea of the space colony inhabited with creatures that look like “croissants made of sh*t” (an actual quote and my favorite part of the movie) is only just scratching the surface. But there’s something else that’s left us baffled too. To understand it, you’ll need to know the full Mickey 17 ending, including which Mickeys are left standing. Mickey 17 ending is one brave sacrifice Mickey 17 (the movie, not the clone) ends in all-out war between Kenneth Marshall’s (Mark Ruffalo) outer-space colony and creatures referred to as “Creepers.” To stop the Creepers wiping out everyone in the colony after Kenneth took a baby creeper hostage, Mickey 18 sacrifices himself to kill Kenneth and call a truce.

One of the biggest changes is Rules Check, which helps users avoid breaking subreddit rules before they even hit “post.” There’s a little wand icon in the post editor—click it, and Reddit will highlight anything in your post that might not follow the rules. This is still being tested on iOS and Android, but it should make things a lot smoother once fully rolled out. Another handy feature is Post Recovery. If your post gets removed because it breaks a subreddit’s rules, Reddit will now give you a clear reason why—and even suggest other communities where it might be a better fit. No more guessing where to repost! To make sure people post in the right place to begin with, Reddit is also adding Community Suggestions. As you start typing a post, it’ll recommend subreddits that might be a good match. It’ll also warn you if a community has posting requirements, like needing a certain number of karma points or an older account. And finally, for those who like to track their posts’ performance, there’s Post Insights. This feature shows stats like views, upvotes, and shares, which is especially useful for creators and businesses trying to boost engagement.

Major product segments include Stabilizers, Cables & Wires, UPS, Pumps and Electrical Appliances. In Q3FY25, VGIL reported a stable 9% YoY revenue growth led by the electronics segment. However, wires & consumer durables were impacted by higher inventory in channels, volatility in copper prices, and muted consumer demand. Despite a 230bps YoY improvement in gross margins, EBITDA margin declined by 50bps YoY to 8.2% due to higher employee & other expenses. Given lower operating performance and higher depreciation expenses, reported net profit grew by a modest 3.4% YoY. We anticipate recovery starting from Q4, led by strong summer demand leading to better scale and improved margin performance. We anticipate FY26 to see better growth led by a pick-up in government spending, healthy demand from the construction sector, and summer products that will drive growth in the near term.

She visited her uncle, Ramazan, who recently underwent heart surgery in Islamabad, and spent time with her maternal relatives, including Faiz Ahmad.

The same can be said about the two hours of yawn fest that is Nadaaniyan . And this is coming from someone who has cheered at Rohit Shetty’s OTT action films and laughed during Salman Khan’s brainless comedies (when they used to be done well). (Also read: Nadaaniyan trailer: Ibrahim Ali Khan is boyfriend-for-hire in college romcom with Khushi Kapoor ) Debut vehicle of Saif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh’s son Ibrahim, this high school drama is a page from the same book as Karan Johar's Student Of The Year. Imagine a film so bland, it makes you nostalgic for the silly, frothy fun of SOTY. The plot The story here revolves around rich Pia (Khushi Kapoor) dealing with personal issues even as she puts on a smile and faces the world. Arjun (Ibrahim Ali Khan) is focused on his career, and doesn’t want any ‘distraction’. After a misunderstanding with her friends, she convinces Arjun to act as her fake boyfriend in exchange for money. Of course feelings get in the way... there’s nothing more to the story. Nadaaniyan is directed by Shauna Gautam, who has assisted before on films such as Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahaani. While the skill can be learnt, art cannot. KJo still gets flak for directing a potboiler college romance like SOTY, but making a film that holds your attention for three hours is no small task. One has to go wrong on...",

Russian Tu-95MS strategic bombers targeted key sites in Ukraine and a missile strike blew up a gas pipeline in Ternopil on Thursday night. The Kremlin launched a huge missile and drone strike on Ukraine 's gas and energy infrastrastructure just hours after US President Donald Trump insisted that Vladimir Putin had \"no choice\" but to end the war, without revealing why the Russian leader's hands were tied. NATO warplanes were put on alert over Poland to shoot down missiles entering the Polish airspace amid the large-scale attack, which caused a gas pipeline in the western city of Ternopil to explode, with images showing flames leaping high into the night sky. Warsaw's armed forces operation command headquarters said a combination of local and \"allied\" aircrafts were on guard against Russian strikes in the country's airspace. Last night's onslaught saw the operational commander \"mobilise all the forces and means at his disposal\" to ensure security on the Ukrainian border, a statement read. The Russian attack came just hours after President Trump said Putin had \"no choice\" but to stop the war in Ukraine , without explaining the reason behind his statement. The missile strikes targeted energy and gas infrastructure across Ukraine , according to energy minister Herman Halushchenko, and injured eight people after damaging a residential building in Kharkiv.

According to the Health and Food Supplements Information Service (HSIS), which analysed UK dietary trends from 1997 and recent research on Brits' eating habits and nutrient intakes, our calcium intake has plummeted by 20% over the last two decades. Public Health Nutritionist Dr Emma Derbyshire from HSIS said: \"Bone density is accrued in youth, so calcium intakes are particularly important in these life stages. Yet 15% of 11 to 18-year-olds have calcium intakes below the LRNI (Lower Reference Nutrient Intake; level below which deficiency may occur). Among girls and young women (11 to 18), this rises to one in five (20%) and in women aged 19 to 64 the numbers of women failing to achieve this dietary target has climbed steadily from 6% to 11%. \"This is concerning given that bone reserves needed later in life are being laid down during these earlier life stages. These inadequate intakes can have hard-hitting effects later in life. \"It's estimated that healthcare costs for hip fractures alone are £5 million a day. That figure will only rise as the population ages. To put it another way, women over the age of 45 will spend more days in hospital due to osteoporosis than they will for diabetes, heart attacks or breast cancer, and every month 1,150 people die following a hip fracture. \"In...",

During a recent interview, she said that this advice —which was to forgo a stable job at IBM for a small startup that later became Microsoft — helped in her journey to becoming a billionaire. Gates mentioned that she got this advice from an IBM supervisor who made this suggestion despite the company’s interest. This made Gates leave a senior position at IBM to join the then-nascent Microsoft, where she spent nine years and played an important role in the company’s growth. She rose to the position of general manager of information products at Microsoft, which is now a $3.1 trillion tech giant. What Melinda Gates said about choosing Microsoft over IBM In an interview with LinkedIn (shared by Fortune), which is available only to the professional networking platform’s premium subscribers, Gates said: “My hiring manager at IBM, a female, said to me, ‘Okay, are you ready to accept the job offer?’ And I said, ‘Well, I have one more company to go interview—this little company, Microsoft. It was tiny. She said, ‘If they give you an offer, you should take it.’ And it dumbfounded me. Here's this woman who's supposed to be my manager, giving me a piece of career advice.” While the move to Microsoft on the West Coast required uprooting her life, the appeal of being part of something potentially groundbreaking was irresistible, Gates...",

Backed by Karan Johar’s Dharmatic Entertainment, the romantic comedy follows the story of college students Arjun and Pia, played by Ibrahim and his fellow star kid Khushi Kapoor. Well, we are quite excited to see Khushi romance Ibrahim onscreen this weekend. But fans were equally delighted to see Khushi with her real life rumoured boyfriend Vedang Raina earlier this week at the special screening of Nadaaniyan held in Mumbai. Well, we have another unseen treat for Khushi and Vedang’s fans! A post shared by Instant Bollywood (@instantbollywood) We came across a cute behind the scenes clip from the premiere of Nadaaniyan , where many celebrities were asked to reveal their love language for the camera. Vedang Raina, who arrived to support his alleged girlfriend, shared a delightful answer which was the same as Khushi Kapoor’s! Vedang shared, “What is my love language? Touch. Physical touch.” Meanwhile, Khushi stated, “Physical touch and words of affirmation.” This is proof that like minds think alike. However, there was another answer in this video which fans believed was the most relatable. We are talking about Khushi’s actor sister Janhvi Kapoor’s love language. A post shared by Netflix India (@netflix_in) The screening of Nadaaniyan was held on March 5, which marked Ibrahim’s birthday. Well, a day later was Janhvi’s birthday on March 6. Ahead of her special day, Janhvi...",

Taking to X, the BJP wrote, \"Karnataka presents a Halal Budget—appeasement at its peak!\" The party highlighted provisions specifically benefiting the Muslim community and questioned the lack of similar allocations for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and Other Backward Classes (OBCs). \"What about SCs, STs, and OBCs? Absolutely nothing!\" the BJP posted, accusing the Congress government of sidelining other communities while focusing only on minority welfare. BJP national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari on Friday launched a sharp attack on the Congress-led Karnataka government over the state Budget presented today. Escalating his criticism, Bhandari termed the Budget a \"modern Muslim League\" Budget, alleging that the Karnataka government is operating in a manner similar to how Muhammad Ali Jinnah governed Pakistan. He further accused the Congress government of undermining Constitutional values by introducing policies and statements that, according to him, solely favor minority communities.

As the tide goes down, whether IPO company or secondary listed entities, they will all come down. Singling out IPO companies alone as a big cause of value destruction is not right.\" \"IPO feeds on what is happening on secondary markets. First 3 months, we saw around 8-9 IPOs, whether or not we can see 25 IPOs this year or not is a tough task,\" he added. He also said that IPO valuations are reasonable considering the kind of returns they gave in the recent past. \"If you look at 120 IPOs, median returns are 25-28%, if pricing wrong it should be more towards negative. Pricing of IPOs are somewhat reasonable,\" he said. GV Ravishankar, MD, PeakXV, said domestic institutional investors are very important in the current scheme of things. \"DIIs have become so much more important in the current scheme of things. They have a massive say in pricing. They're pushing very hard for a more attractive price. It is a good balance.

Presenters Kate Garraway and Rob Rinder delivered the latest headlines to ITV viewers during the morning programme. The Duchess of Sussex's recent appearance on The Drew Barrymore Show, where she promoted her new Netflix series With Love, Meghan, was one of the first topics discussed. Meghan had appeared on the US chat show the previous day (March 6), sharing details about her home life in California with Prince Harry and their two children. She also showcased her culinary skills in the kitchen with Drew, demonstrating techniques featured in her new series. However, GMB viewers were not pleased with the continued coverage of Meghan, feeling that the show had discussed her too extensively that week. \"Why are they talking about Meghan AGAIN? They spoke about her being on the Drew Barrymore show yesterday! My god this show are obsessed with her, living rent free in their minds,\" one viewer complained on X (formerly Twitter). Another user criticised the show's producers, saying: \"Whoever the @ITV producer of @GMB they really have an obsession with Meghan Markle for the last 8 years from Piers Morgan , Dan Wootton . We are now in 2025 and they are still obsessing over Meghan.

Yet, for that specific demographic it is likely to appeal to (those who only want an iPhone, for starters), this does almost everything you’d expect an iPhone and iOS to do. That defines value. The demographic may include someone who is still rocking an iPhone X or iPhone Xs (these references are simply illustrative examples), and simply wants a new iPhone without having to spend a rupee more than absolutely necessary. In fact, as I see it, this could also be an ideal first iPhone for someone younger in your already iPhone-totting family. An iPhone that has all the bells but makes do without just the right whistles to keep this price what it is. Some could very well argue that ₹ 59,900 isn’t exactly an affordable iPhone in the typical “SE” avatar, as I pointed out earlier, the iPhone 16e sits somewhere between the last iPhone SE that we knew and the last iPhone 13 mini that we knew — that’s in terms of functionality, size and of course, perception of value. It isn’t exactly very far from the ₹ 79,900 onwards pricing of the iPhone 16 , and there is enough median there to negate any argument of overlap. Back to the question of value — unlike previous generations of the iPhone SE, an iPhone 16e is on a diet of the latest A18 chip along with Apple Intelligence (the entire suite is available, including writing tools) for parity with the iPhone 16.

        "content": "In the world of stock markets, SME stocks often shine as the darlings of bull runs, even rallying multiple hundred times in some cases. However, when the tides turn, these are one of the first and hardest to be hit. The recent market correction laid bare this reality with 15 stocks plunging 80% or more from the highs.This is considered a near wipeout of wealth, highlighting the volatile nature of such stocks in bearish times. Nearly five companies --- Waaree Technologies, Cina Healthcare, Ahalosar Technologies, Domcode Health Tech, and Kalahridhaan Trendz --- fell nearly 85% each. Further, if we take the ceiling of -70%, the number of stocks that make the cut goes as high as 36.This steep decline in SMEs is broadly in-line with the overall correction in Indian equities and serves as a reminder of the risks associated with chasing these high-flying stocks. Waaree Technologies, for instance, was once talk of the town for its stellar returns going into thousand percentage points. But when the market fell, the stock wiped out 87% of investors' wealth.The recent market slump is due to a multitude of factors. The strong bull run since the pandemic days meant that valuations have become quite stretched. This has been coupled with underwhelming few quarters of earnings, where the profits grew in mid single-digits.Then there is also the selling pressure from the foreign investors, who pulled out over Rs 2 lakh crore from Indian markets over the last three months.Investing in SME...",

The court stated that the project is \"subject to court orders.” This observation was made as the apex court accepted the plea from Seychelles-based SecLink Group. SecLink Group claims that the tender conditions were modified in favour of Adani Properties, a division of the Adani Group. According to SecLink, while Adani Properties offered Rs 5,069 crore, their bid was lower than SecLink's at Rs 7,200 crore, with the latter willing to boost it further to Rs 8,640 crore. The court issued notices to the Maharashtra government and Adani Properties and has listed the matter for hearing on May 25. According to the CNBC-TV18 report, the apex court sought a response on SecLink's ouster from the project. Observing that SecLink was the highest bidder in 2018, the court questioned if the state government is entitled to cancel the tender and also if conditions were altered to oust SecLink.",

        "content": "China’s foreign minister has accused the US of “two-faced” behaviour, condemning the imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods and warning against the “law of the jungle” that could emerge from Donald Trump’s “America First” policy. Speaking at the sidelines of China’s annual parliamentary gathering, Wang Yi said China would “firmly counter” US pressure. “No country should think that it can suppress China and maintain good relations,” he added. Wang’s comments came days after the US president announced an increase on tariffs on Chinese imports. This week, Washington increased tariffs on a range of Chinese goods to 20%. Wang condemned the levies as “arbitrary”. Customs data published on Friday showed that the value of China’s exports in January and February grew 2.3% year-on-year, well below expectations, underlining the pressure that China’s exporters will be under this year if China is to hit its GDP growth target of 5%. China’s foreign ministry this week made aggressive comments about the US, warning that in a “tariff war, trade war or any other war, China will fight to the end”. In contrast, Wang’s comments on Friday were more muted, but the frustration at Washington’s stance towards Beijing was clear. “A big country should honour its international obligations,” Wang said, adding that countries “should not bully” each other. If countries pursue their own interests without regard for the international order, “the law of the jungle would reign the world again” and small...",

        "content": "After years of wrangling with authorities, students in Thailand can now let their hair down. Literally. On Wednesday, Thailand's Supreme Administrative Court annulled a 50-year-old directive by the education ministry, which had previously set out rules on hairstyles for school students: short hair for boys and ear-length bobs for girls. In practice, hairstyle rules have been gradually relaxed across many schools. But some still used the 1975 junta-issued directive as a guideline, and would cut the hair of students who didn't adhere. The 1975 directive violated individual freedoms protected by the constitution and was out of touch with today's society, the court said. The court decision this week came in response to a petition, filed by 23 public school students in 2020, which argued that the 1975 directive was unconstitutional. Student activists have long campaigned for hairstyle rules to be relaxed, saying it infringes on their human dignity and personal freedom over their bodies. One of them is Panthin Adulthananusak, who recently graduated from university. \"In the eyes of kids like us back then... even though it seemed impossible, we wanted to do something,\" he told the BBC. \"If no student in Thai history rose up to challenge the power of the adults that suppressed us, it would be a lifelong embarrassment.\" In response to such campaigns, the education ministry in 2020 allowed students to have longer hairstyles - but there remained some restrictions. Boys' hair could not...",

China’s top diplomat has declared that Beijing will “firmly counter” United States pressure after President Donald Trump heaped tariffs on Chinese goods. Foreign Minister Wang Yi also accused Washington of “meeting good with evil” for provoking a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Speaking at a news conference on the sidelines of a key political meeting in the Chinese capital on Friday, Wang warned that the “law of the jungle” could take hold in the world if nations were to pursue purely their own interests. Recommended Stories The US and China have been reengaging in tit-for-tat retaliatory tariffs since Trump’s return to office in January. The US has imposed flat tariffs of 20 percent on all Chinese imports, and in response, China slapped additional 15 percent duties on US imports including chicken, pork, soy and beef, and expanded controls on doing business with key US companies. “China-US economic and trade ties are mutual,” Wang told reporters. “If you choose to cooperate, you can achieve mutually beneficial and win-win results. If you use only pressure, China will firmly counter,” he added. Wang also rejected Trump’s assertion that the imposition of new US tariffs is punishment for Beijing’s failure to help with the US fentanyl overdose crisis. “The abuse of fentanyl is an issue that the US has to solve itself,” Wang stressed....",

China reported lower than expected exports and imports for January-February, with exports growing just 2.3% and imports sinking 8.4%, the government reported. China's trade data for the first two months of the year are usually combined to make up for distortions from Lunar New Year holidays.

Tropical Cyclone Alfred was forecast to cross the coast of Queensland state north of downtown Brisbane, Australia’s third-most populous city, early Saturday, Bureau of Meteorology manager Matt Collopy said. “It‘s important to note that the exact track is still uncertain,” Collopy told reporters in Brisbane. Alfred was moving west with sustained winds near the center of 95 kph (59 mph) and gusting to 130 kph (81 mph). But the storm was expected to weaken as it approached Brisbane, Collopy said. “This will mean that destructive winds are unlikely for Brisbane itself, but damaging wind gusts to 120 kph (80 mph) are expected and they will develop quickly as the system approaches,” Collopy said. Two people narrowly escaped a large tree falling on their home in the Currumbin Valley on Thursday night. The couple were lying only centimeters (inches) from where the tree came to rest in their bedroom, police said. “Thankfully, both patients sustained only minor injuries,” Queensland Ambulance Service said in a statement.

The now-defunct American short-seller claimed that she and her spouse held investments in offshore funds controlled by Vinod Adani, the older brother of Gautam Adani, chairman of Adani Group, which was also at the receiving end of Hindenburg's allegations of wrongdoing.Also read | Lock, Stock & Madhabi Puri Buch: A miss here, a hit thereBesides, the Congress also leveled allegations against Buch for trading in listed securities during her tenure and...",

        "content": "Nelson [New Zealand], : Maddy Green's superb century and Hannah Rowe's impressive four-wicket haul guided New Zealand to a commanding 78-run victory over Sri Lanka in the second ODI in Nelson. With this win, the White Ferns secured an unassailable 1-0 lead in the three-match series, with one game remaining, as per ESPNcricinfo. After the rain-marred first ODI in Napier ended in a no-result, the two teams met under better conditions at Saxton Oval. New Zealand captain Suzie Bates opted to bat first after winning the toss, but the hosts found themselves in early trouble. Bates was run out for just five in the fourth over, followed by quick dismissals of Emma McLeod and Brooke Halliday, courtesy of Achini Kulasuriya and Chamari Athapaththu. Georgia Plimmer's departure for 28 left New Zealand struggling at 59/4 in 18 overs. Green, however, anchored the innings brilliantly. She built a crucial 51-run partnership with Isabella Gaze for the sixth wicket, stabilizing the innings. Contributions from the lower-middle order further strengthened New Zealand's total Jess Kerr scored 38 off 44 balls, while wicketkeeper Polly Inglis struck a brisk 34 off 21 balls not out, including five boundaries. Green remained the backbone of the innings, bringing up her century off 109 balls. She had been in outstanding form in the domestic One-Day Cup, scoring 125 and 126 in two of her last three matches, and carried that confidence into this game. New Zealand finished strongly, adding 84 runs in the...",

The move has come as a surprise to film producers, who frequently request ticket price hikes ahead of major movie releases. Also Read - Karnataka Budget 2025: Bengaluru to get 9,000 new electric buses as state focuses on green public transport During his budget speech, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah emphasized that ticket prices across all theatres would be capped at ₹ 200. While a similar price ceiling had been imposed earlier, it was not strictly enforced. Over the years, Bengaluru has seen a steep rise in ticket prices, with some movie tickets selling for over ₹ 600 during initial release days. To make cinema more affordable for audiences, the government has now decided to standardize ticket prices across the state. The new rule will be implemented soon across the state. This decision follows recent remarks by Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar, who made controversial statements about the film industry. At a public event, he remarked that film productions are dependent on government approvals for shooting and that he knew \"where to tighten the nuts and bolts\" when necessary.

Although this is based on the Australian feature Five Blind Dates, which came on the platform just an year ago, Picture This gets to the hilarious specificity of Indian NRI culture to deliver a harmless, fun and sincere romantic comedy.

She needs to find a man fast and get married. With her younger sister Sonal (Anoushka Chadha) just about to start her pre-wedding festivities, their mother Laxmi (Sindhu Vee) has yet another chance to remind Pia to settle down with a man.

She wants to focus on her career at the moment, given that her studio is not exactly doing that well.

Fresh off Wednesday’s announcement of the new boxing league formed by Turki Alalshikh , which will be run by UFC Founder & CEO Dana White , who said they will feature their own belt, the four sanctioning bodies (WBA, WBC, IBF & WBO) took a jab to the face which was unexpected. Canelo faced off with Skull at the end of the presser and Alalshikh signaled to Canelo that only the Undisputed and Ring titles would be displayed in the photo with the three of them. This move was a show of force and sent a message to the four sanctioning of what is to come. This is a mixed message as the four sanctioning bodies currently have business deals with Riyadh Season, which has made them a part of the Saudi takeover. On the other hand, White is not a fan of multiple sanctioning bodies which makes Alalshikh’s move a bit of a head-scratcher. Did his thinking change from when those deals were made, and now, with White involved, Alalshikh is leaning more towards the White/UFC model, which simplifies weight classes and features one title per weight class? Many interesting things are on the horizon, so let’s see how they all play out. With regard to the presser itself, it was a typical Canelo event where he displays a high level of...",

According to Mishra, the cost of maintaining liquidity in the economy stands high. \"Easing liquidity is needed.

Mishra shared these views as part of a panel discussion at Moneycontrol's Global Wealth Summit 2025 taking place in Mumbai today.

The cost of liquidity has gone up,\" Mishra said. Catch LIVE updates of Moneycontrol's Global Wealth Summit Aside from the monetary tightening, Mishra highlighted regulatory risk aversion and a slower government spending as factors that inflicted the \"self-induced\" economic slowdown in the country. \"There were three factors--fiscal, monetary and regulatory that caused the structural economic slowdown that we're seeing.

Arne Slot, who took over from Klopp last summer, has Liverpool 13 points clear at the top of the table. That lead could extend to 16 points before Arsenal plays Manchester United this weekend if the Reds can beat Southampton at home. While Slot and his players continue to insist that there is still work to be done, they are the overwhelming favorite to lift the league title trophy in May.

During a discussion on PTV Sports, Hafeez questioned the legacy of players who represented Pakistan in the 90s and early 2000s, saying that they failed to inspire the next generation by failing to win a number of ICC events during their time. Former Pakistan pacer Akhtar, who was also part of the side during the 90s and early 2000s, was also part of the same discussion, but he seemed agitated while Hafeez was having a go at the former players. \"I am a huge fan of those who played in the 1990s but when it comes to legacy, they left nothing for Pakistan. They didn't win an ICC event - they lost the (World Cups of) 1996, 1999 and 2003. We reached one final (in the 1999 World Cup) and lost that badly. As stars, as players, they were the mega superstars. But then they couldn't inspire us by winning an ICC event. Then came a difficult period that we had to go through and then in 2007 we lost the final (of the T20 World Cup).,\" Hafeez said on PTV Sports.On the contrary, Hafeez lauded Pakistan's T20 World Cup (2009) and Champions Trophy (2017) winning sides. He also explained why players like Babar Azam get idolised by fans.\" In 2009 we won under Younis Khan's captaincy and so there was an inspiration for the next generation.

Spurs were certainly in need of some advantage to take with them to London after playing AZ Alkmaar in the opening leg of the Round of 16 in the Europa League. Spurs witnessed the return of their coveted striker Solanke, which marks some good news for the Lilywhites. It was a must-win match for Ange Postecoglou , especially considering that he had stated at the beginning of the season that he delivers trophies in his second year, and now this was the only one left for them to win. Football pundits, as well as fans, were all backing the Lilywhites to win this one, but it was not the case, as AZ Alkmaar had picked up the lead. Now, we shall wait and see what comes next for Tottenham as they head into the second leg at N17. The first half did not go down well for AV Alkmaar, who were unable to recover after a very quick setback. A terrible own goal executed by Lucas Bergvall gave the opponent the lead in the 18th minute, and it seemed for the rest of the match that Spurs never fully regained their composure. Brennan Johnson and Son Heung-min had half-chances, and AZ were looking dangerous while Troy Parrott troubled Guglielmo Vicario. Kevin Danso was kept busy at the back, blocking multiple efforts.

As per accounts of the shoot, production designers Subrata Chakraborty and Amit Ray meticulously built a complex set at Film City, the appropriate backdrop for the recreation of this momentous event of Maratha history . Oscar-winning music director AR Rahman directed the music for ‘Chhaava,’ and for this specific song, he is known to have used traditional instruments such as the dholki, tuntune, and sambal with the intention of bringing out the original sounds of the period. The choreography was handed over to Vijay Ganguly, who had previously worked on films such as ‘Stree 2,’ and he created a colorful dance number with more than 1,500 people to represent the whole city of Raigad uniting for the special occasion.

Kyrgios trailed the Dutchman 6-7 (7-9) 0-3 at Indian Wells but was showcasing some good tennis in his latest comeback before being forced to bow out. The 29-year-old cut his practice session short earlier this week due to wrist pain, admitting at the time that he \"couldn't catch a break at the moment\" with his body. He looked bright against Van de Zandschulp and held a set point during the first-set tiebreaker, which he ultimately lost before falling 3-0 down in the second set. It was clear something was bothering Kyrgios, and he then grew visibly emotional during a conversation with his trainer before conceding the match. Van de Zandschulp progressed to face Kyrgios' close friend Novak Djokovic in the second round, while the injury-hit Australian continues to battle to overcome his long-term wrist problem. \"I wasn't too confident that I was going to be able to play today, to be honest,\" Kyrgios admitted after his Indian Wells exit. \"Two days ago in practice, I had to stop my practice because I felt pain in my wrist. I felt like it was OK to take to the court [but it] just got progressively worse. I started feeling sharp pain in my wrist.\" He added: \"This process has been probably one of the biggest challenges I've faced in my life.

In a conversation with The Express, Smith explained that the show wasn’t meant to change skeptics’ minds but to reinforce Meghan’s brand and appeal to those who already admire her. While it may not win over critics, Smith said she thinks it will achieve its goal of presenting Meghan as a lifestyle influencer who stays in her comfort zone. \"The show was never designed to convert skeptics—it was created to solidify her existing brand and appeal to the aspirational audience who already resonate with her,” she said. \"This is Meghan, staying firmly in her comfort zone, doing what she does best - being a fully fledged aspirational domestic goddess influencer—whether that’s well-received or not depends entirely on who’s watching.\"",

The Supreme Court today declined to stay the ongoing construction work for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP), refusing to overturn the Bombay High Court's decision in favour of the Adani Group. Hearing an appeal filed by UAE-based Seclink Technologies Corporation, the court said that work on the project had already begun, including the demolition of some railway quarters. Seclink had challenged the Maharashtra government's decision to award the Dharavi project to Adani Properties Limited after canceling Seclink's earlier bid. The Supreme Court, however, directed that all payments related to the project be made from a single escrow account. Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sanjiv Khanna, leading a bench that included Justice PV Sanjay Kumar, remarked orally that the Bombay High Court's decision was justified as the railway line would also be developed and incorporated into the project. The court issued notices to the Maharashtra government and Adani Properties and has scheduled the next hearing for May 25. Seclink Technologies, which had originally bid Rs 7,200 crore for the Dharavi redevelopment, informed the Supreme Court that it was willing to increase its offer by 20 per cent. The bench directed Seclink to submit an affidavit detailing its revised bid. In December 2024, the Bombay High Court upheld the Maharashtra government's decision to cancel Seclink's 2019 bid and issue a fresh tender...",

Raducanu was playing for the first time since dealing with a stalker at the Dubai Open last month. The former US Open champion, 22, is receiving extra security in California after the man was able to approach her twice while she was alone. Raducanu - who had been left cowering behind the umpire's chair in tears after receiving repeated unwanted attention from a \"fixated\" man before and during her second-round match against Karolina Muchova in Dubai - made a positive start against Uchijima. However, after taking an early break chance in the opening game to hold for a 2-0 lead, Raducanu seemed to struggle in the blustery conditions. Uchijima soon reeled off four games in a row after twice breaking back. Raducanu, though, dug in to win the seventh game with another break to love, only to then be unable to hold again and trail 3-5. Uchijima kept the pressure on and secured a first set point when Raducanu sent a return long. Raducanu - starting a trial period with Slovakian coach Vladimir Platenik - was moving freely enough at the start of the second set, but soon found herself facing another couple of break points, which Uchijima eventually converted. Despite Raducanu coming to the net, Uchijima's power proved the difference as another big forehand saw the world No52 open up a 2-0 advantage. Raducanu saved a break point in the next game with...",

Last week the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he planned to increase military spending to 2.5% of GDP to bolster the UK's defences. And The Telegraph has reported that more than 100 MPs and peers have now signed an open letter addressed to Britain’s finance industry urging it to “sweep away ill-considered anti-defence rules” that limit investments in the arms industry. Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor, is also reported as agreeing that investment in the British defence sector should not be considered a breach of ethics standards. The letter said: “We must rethink ESG mechanisms that often wrongly exclude all defence investment as ‘unethical’. There can be no more ethical investment than giving the Ukrainian people every ounce of support that can be mustered by their allies. “Our financial institutions can do more to enable our UK Defence sector to provide the vital military supplies President Zelenskyy needs. You can also help Britain to rapidly generate the capabilities needed to defend itself.” Signatories include high ranking military figures including Baron Robertson of Port Ellen, the former general secretary of Nato, and Baron West of Spithead, a former Admiral in the Royal Navy.

However, a lesser-known Aussie show has been gaining traction as a \"hidden gem\" that could potentially dethrone Vince Gilligan's multi-award-winning series as the crime-comedy king. Critics have lavished praise on the show, calling it \"tremendous\" and highlighting its exceptional writing, directing and acting. If you're a fan of Breaking Bad, it might be time to give this unsung hero a try. The show, which first premiered in 2018, is now streaming in its entirety on Disney+, with three seasons to binge to your heart's content. Set in Sydney, the program centers around Ray Shoesmith, a hitman-for-hire with a code of conduct that often leads him down some pretty twisted paths. Played to perfection by Scott Ryan, who also created the series based on his 2005 movie The Magician, Ray's story is a masterful balancing act of dark and light, with moments of humor expertly woven in to break the tension. So if you're ready for a show that's action-packed, thrilling, tense, touching, and downright side-splitting, look no further than the unforgettable Mr. Inbetween. The series Mr Inbetween is taking the critics by storm with a sterling 95% Rotten Tomatoes score. The Age’s Debi Enker hailed it as “a dark, glittering gem”, while Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter highlighted that “The secret sauce of Mr Inbetween that's essential is that the show is funny.

With a record of 19-11 away from Madison Square Garden, the Knicks are one of the best road teams in the NBA and presented several unique challenges to the Purple and Gold tonight. The score was 31-27 in favor of the Lakers after the first 12 minutes but it wasn't long before the Knicks went on a run to pull the game right back within reach before halftime. As the game dwindled into its final minutes, things slowed to a crawl, giving the Lakers a breath of life. Thanks to a final push by LeBron James in the fourth quarter ( who scored a game-tying three with 1:51 on the clock ) the Lakers forced overtime, which is when Luka Doncic took over to finish the job. In 43 minutes on the court, Doncic put up 32 points, seven rebounds, and 12 assists on 9-23 shooting. He was joined by LeBron James , who dropped 31 points, 12 rebounds, and eight assists on 11-23 shooting. Off the bench, Gabe Vincent finished with 12 points, one rebound, and one assist in 22 minutes. For the Knicks, Jalen Brunson contributed 39 points, four rebounds, and 10 assists on 13-26 shooting.

I said, ‘Haan, kaun?’ (Yes, who is it) Ugly hadn’t even released till then, but he watched it. I couldn’t believe it when he said that I am Ranbir Kapoor. In the last 13 years, nothing of that sorts had happened.” He added, “I thought that my friends are quite naughty and one of them was pulling a prank on me. I said again, ‘Kaun hai, bata de bhai?’ Then it got confirmed that it was him only. Then we talked for quite a while. He said so many good things about Ugly.” The actor also...",

The NCW, which had been closely monitoring the situation, swiftly responded, stating that the kind of language used during the show was not acceptable. The Commission highlighted that the comments made were not only inappropriate but also reinforced harmful stereotypes, particularly in the context of women and marginalized groups.

Samsung has just announced a huge deal on its ultimate wearable that makes it far more affordable than before. During its launch last year, the new Galaxy Watch Ultra would have set you back a whopping £599. Luckily, that's now changed with the Korean technology brand slashing the cost by £100 to just £499. SEE THE DEAL HERE That feels like a much more reasonable price and is also £300 cheaper than its Apple Watch Ultra rival . For those not in the know, the Galaxy Watch Ultra comes packed with upgrades you won't find on its cheaper siblings. Firstly, there's a rugged design that is made from titanium - Samsung says this is officially the \"toughest Galaxy Watch ever\" and it should mean it survives years strapped to your wrist. That upgraded styling also offers better water resistance, along with coping with high altitudes and bigger changes in temperature. So, if you head up a mountain and things drop to -20 degrees the Ultra will keep on working. Another addition to this device is the Quick Button, which takes you to favourite apps and other features via a simple tap. That means you can launch a workout or start a run without scrolling through endless menus on the big and bright display. Other extras worth a mention include an in-built alarm should you get in trouble and find you need some help, a special night mode which turns the display black and red plus there is highly...",

This trade created exciting new duos in the game of basketball. In Dallas, it would be Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving, while in Los Angeles, the pairing would be LeBron James and Luka Dončić. The trade made virtually no sense, yet it happened. Afterward, reports emerged that the Mavericks were dissatisfied with Dončić’s conditioning issues, with some claiming he had ballooned to 270 pounds at one point. Since the trade, the Lakers have surged to second in the Western Conference, while the Mavericks have continued to slide down the standings. Mark Cuban, the former owner of the Dallas Mavericks, sold the majority of the organization to the Adelson and Dumont families. Cuban was always known for his deep affection for Dončić. At one point, he even joked that he would choose Dončić over his own wife. In a recent exclusive interview, Cuban shared his thoughts on the trade, subtly taking a shot at Davis. “If the Mavs are going to trade Luka, that’s one thing—just get a better deal. No disrespect to Anthony Davis... If we had gotten four unprotected first-round picks, along with Anthony Davis and Max Christie, this would be a different conversation,” Cuban said. Cuban was then asked whether he would have ever traded Dončić, but he declined to respond, choosing instead to stay silent. The former full-time owner is clearly upset...",

On Thursday, two South Korean KF-16 fighter jets mistakenly released four MK-82 bombs each on a civilian area in Pocheon, a city near the tense border with North Korea . The bombing, which injured nearly 30 people, two of them seriously, occurred when South Korean and U.S. forces were engaging in a live-fire drill in connection with their broader Freedom Shield command post exercise set to begin Monday. This year’s Freedom Shield exercise is the allies’ first major joint training since President Donald Trump returned to office in January and comes amid concerns about North Korea’s booming military cooperation with Russia . South Korea and the U.S. announced details of the exercises on Thursday, but it was overshadowed by the news of bombing which drew intense public criticism in South Korea. Both the South Korean and U.S. militaries halted all live-fire exercises across South Korea. Military officials said that South Korea’s air force also stopped the flights of its entire aircrafts except surveillance planes and others needed for emergency situations.

None of the dozen are fully named in the BBC press release , but it is possible to work out who most of them are from their photos, first names and locations. They will play a tournament including some puzzle solving, with expert commentary by the three-time British champion and Olympiad gold medallist David...",

        "content": "WASHINGTON -- America's butterflies are disappearing because of insecticides, climate change and habitat loss, with the number of the winged beauties down 22% since 2000, a new study finds. The first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday's journal Science. “Butterflies have been declining the last 20 years,” said study co-author Nick Haddad, an entomologist at Michigan State University. “And we don't see any sign that that's going to end.\" A team of scientists combined 76,957 surveys from 35 monitoring programs and blended them for an apples-to-apples comparison and ended up counting 12.6 million butterflies over the decades. Last month an annual survey that looked just at monarch butterflies, which federal officials plan to put on the threatened species list , counted a nearly all-time low of fewer than 10,000, down from 1.2 million in 1997. Many of the species in decline fell by 40% or more. David Wagner, a University of Connecticut entomologist who wasn't part of the study, praised its scope. And he said while the annual rate of decline may not sound significant, it is “catastrophic and saddening” when compounded over time. “In just 30 or 40 years we are talking about losing half the butterflies (and other insect life) over...",

Fiscal transparency refers to the information and data available to the public about the government’s fiscal policy making process. Finance Commissions are constituted every five years to decide on the magnitude and criteria of tax transfers. However, the data with Finance Commissions and the tax transfer formula designed are completely opaque to the public. The processes of deciding the magnitude of devolution and the selection of criteria to decide the tax sharing formula are confined within the Finance Commission, even though recommendations of the Finance Commissions have so far remained “conclusive” as they have been accepted without any amendment by the Union government. A wealth of data that is beyond reach Fiscal transparency depends on the “clarity, reliability, frequency, timeliness, and relevance of public fiscal reporting and the openness of such information to public”, as explained by the IMF. Recently, the 16th Finance Commission Chairman Professor Arvind Panagariya made a powerful statement regarding the fiscal transparency of the Commission. He highlighted that there is no mechanism so far that brings together data generated by various Finance Commissions in one place. He highlighted that a lot of statistics are compiled each time by the Finance Commission, and there is a need to preserve this data, creating a data portal. This suggestion for fiscal transparency is welcome....",

He said that the state plans to borrow ₹ 1.16 lakh crore, pushing Karnataka’s total liabilities to ₹ 7.64 lakh crore from ₹ 6.65 lakh crore last year. “Karnataka is one of the fastest-growing states in India, contributing 8.4% to the National Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The state has continued its growth trajectory in 2024-25 and is poised to achieve a GSDP growth rate of 7.4%, outpacing the national growth rate of 6.4%,” Siddaramaiah said in his budget speech. “Many of the welfare programmes we offer, including the five guarantees, are not merely freebies; I can confidently say that these are strategic investments made on economic and social principles,” he said. The chief minister targetted the central government for failing to compensate Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue losses, non-devolution of cesses and surcharges, and lower tax devolution, which he said exacerbated Karnataka’s fiscal challenges. “The Union government’s failure to fully compensate for GST revenue loss, non-devolution of cesses and surcharges, and lower tax devolution has put Karnataka in a difficult position.

Yes, companies like Hindalco where Novelis has a huge presence in USA, something like these tariffs would actually not make a huge difference or a huge dent to them because they have a good presence in USA.

So, what we have seen in the past is whenever there is a tariff or anything like that, the metal prices usually go up in the near term and that is actually positive for companies like Hindalco. But give us a sense that do you believe that the metal prices, how will China dominate that because in the latest development from China, China has asked the select steel mills to actually cut production.

That rock in the sky heading your way fast is actually an asteroid called 99942 Apophis, named after the ancient Egyptian god of chaos. Roughly the size of Wembley Stadium, when Apophis hits it’ll do to our species what another asteroid did to the dinosaurs 66m years ago. Did I say “when”? I obviously meant “if”. After all, as Tom Phillips puts it, space is big, and little Earth easily missable – despite the nominative determinism of what he nicknames Smashy McDeathrock. Plus, in 2022 Nasa deliberately crashed the Dart spacecraft into the asteroid Dimorphos, knocking if off course. If Smashy hits London, hypothesises Phillips, it’ll engulf everywhere from Camden to Clapham in a fireball and leave a crater three miles wide that “would have previously contained approximately 150 branches of Pret”. Truly, any survivors will envy the dead. The serious purpose of Phillips’s jolly doomscroll through the apocalyptic sex cults, pandemics, nuclear armageddons, rapture-fetishising fruitloops, numerologically obsessed nincompoops, swivel-eyed preppers waiting out zombie apocalypses in their Utah silos, not to mention the Bible’s (spoiler alert!) troubling last act, is to work out quite why, after so many failed prophesies, doom-mongery still thrives.

Months of cold winds, indoor heating and lack of sunlight can strip the skin of moisture and leave it looking a little lacklustre. You may have found yourself scouting around your washbag trying to find something to brighten your skin now the sun is out. “The best way to revive skin is by using a face brush – it not only sloughs off dead skin but also boosts circulation and promotes lymph drainage, giving the face a natural lift,” explains nutritional health coach and co-founder of eyeam world Roxy Marrone . Following up with a hydrating moisturiser is the simplest way to restore bounce and luminosity. While exfoliation may be the obvious answer for brightening skin, Medik8’ s chief product officer Daniel Isaacs says it’s all about how you exfoliate. “A sluggish skin renewal process can cause a build-up of dead skin cells, making the complexion appear dull,” he explains. “To revive your skin, focus on gentle exfoliation to remove dead skin cells, deep hydration to replenish lost moisture and antioxidant protection to restore a healthy glow.” What skincare ingredients actually brighten skin? While drinking water and weekly exfoliation can help dead skin cell turnover and replenish the appearance of your skin, there are some particular ingredients that can help bring back that beam. Resveratrox and bakuchiol are emerging as superior brightening agents. Marrone and her...",

Evelyn Hockstein | Reuters Taken from CNBC’s Daily Open, our international markets newsletter — Subscribe today U.S. President Donald Trump expanded his tariff pause to goods coming in from Canada and Mexico, so long as they satisfy terms of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal between all countries. Unlike Trump's Wednesday reprieve to automakers, which bumped up stocks, investors weren't relieved this time. All major U.S. benchmarks sank, with the Nasdaq Composite limping into correction territory and losing its post-election Trump bump. That might be because the Trump administration seems to be doubling down on tariffs, even as it acknowledges — and dismisses — the repercussions of such levies. Trump brushed off the idea that he's watching the markets, causing dismay in investors who were banking on the \"Trump put,\" the idea that the current president would prevent a steep drop in the stocks. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent waved away the idea of \"cheap goods\" as integral to the \"American dream.\" What you need to know today Tariff pause on some goods Goods imported into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico, and which are compliant with the North American trade agreement known as the USMCA , will be...",

Gomes has been in the news for a while, given that his contract with his current employers is set to expire after the conclusion of the ongoing campaign, and the Manchester United academy graduate has been speculated to move in a high-profile free transfer with the likes of West Ham United, Man United, Aston Villa , and Tottenham Hotspur linked with a move for his signature. And transfer guru Fabrizio Romano has provided us with the latest on the 24-year-old’s situation. Looking at him from the North Londoner’s point of view, he could be exactly the midfield reinforcement that Ange Postecoglou has been striving for since he took over the reins at N17. Gomes brings that creativity, technical skill, and versatility in the middle of the park, and then you consider his ability to operate in multiple roles, from a central playmaker to a more advanced attacking midfielder, which gives a lot of tactical flexibility to the dynamics that the Australian head coach operates in. When you look at his age (and profile), he also fits into the transfer strategy at Hotspur Way, given his young age and the level of maturity that he has been showing for Lille and for England....",

Europa League: Where We At? Today was the first leg of the Europa League’s Round of 16 stage. Eight of these teams were well-rested, having earned a bye from the qualification round by finishing in the top spots. The others had to fight and scrum in a two-game knockout stage. Tottenham, to my surprise, were the former. Alkmaar (who finished in 19th place) had to take on Turkey’s Galatasaray, whom they beat 6 – 3 on aggregate. The 900ish Spurs fans who crossed the channel had some high expectations, and rightly so. A number of players were returning from injury (Dominic Solanke, Cristian Romero, Micky van de Ven). Manager Ange Postecoglou has a remarkable track record winning trophies in his second year. And with a squad valuation nearly 11x greater than the opposition, Spurs (despite their woeful EPL campaign so far) should be showing a group of jumped up cheesemongers who’s got the cheddar. That Didn’t Happen Tottenham’s baby-faced Lucas Bergvall did his best to amputate fellow Swede Mayckel Lahdo’s foot at the ankle in the 7th minute, forcing the hosts into an early substitution and removing an attacking threat. So it was perfect kismet that ten minutes later Bergvall whiffed a clearance off his shin and into his own net. Adding to the irony... the Alkmaar player who made the cross was...",

Dunn appeared in the series as Lester Kitchens. It started life in December 2022, with the follow up arriving more than two years later in January 2025. Responses to the show’s return were generally positive, but many drew comparisons to The Night Agent , a more successful spy thriller that returned for a second season just before The Recruit . Unlike The Night Agent ’s second season, The Recruit has underperformed – and fans of the cancelled show are now complaining that The Night Agent stole The Recruit ’s limelight.

According to the draft legislation, which was accessed by CNN-News18, it will allow an amendment to the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurements (KTPP) Act to insert Category II(B) allowing reservation for Muslims. The draft legislation states: “For the words, figures and brackets “Category-I and Category II(A) \" the words, figures, brackets and punctuation “Category-l, Category-II(A) and Category II(B)\" shall be substituted.\" “Category II(B) shall mean the backward classes specified as Category-II(B) in the orders issued by the state government from time to time without considering the income criteria,\" it states. Meanwhile, the SC/ST contractors enjoy a 24.1% reservation in government contracts and the government later extended the benefit to communities coming under Category 1. The government also increased the cap on the size of the contracts from Rs 50 lakh...",

Tropical Cyclone Alfred was forecast to cross the coast of Queensland state north of downtown Brisbane , Australia’s third-most populous city, early Saturday, Bureau of Meteorology manager Matt Collopy said. “It‘s important to note that the exact track is still uncertain,” Collopy told reporters in Brisbane. Alfred was moving west with sustained winds near the center of 95 kph (59 mph) and gusting to 130 kph (81 mph). But the storm was expected to weaken as it approached Brisbane, Collopy said. “This will mean that destructive winds are unlikely for Brisbane itself, but damaging wind gusts to 120 kph (80 mph) are expected and they will develop quickly as the system approaches,” Collopy said. Evacuations and power outages Two people narrowly escaped a large tree falling on their home in the Currumbin Valley on Thursday night. The couple were lying only centimeters (inches) from where the tree came to rest in their bedroom, police said. “Thankfully, both patients sustained only minor injuries,” Queensland Ambulance Service said in a statement. In Queensland, 46,000 homes and businesses had lost power due to falling trees, mostly in Gold Coast, officials said. In flood-prone northern New South Wales, 43,000 premises had lost power by early Friday,...",

As the video went viral on social media, several netizens mocked him for having teary eyes during the conference. Some netizens connected his cry with the election that is soon going to take place and he might loose it. The next Canadian election will be held no later than October 20, 2025. \"Justin Trudeau is a fraud. He didn’t cry when Canadian families were taxed into poverty. He didn’t cry when seniors were forced to die alone. He didn’t cry when he heard kids were in line at food banks across the country. He didn’t cry when he saw homelessness everywhere.

        "content": "India are attempting to break a 37-year-old curse as they take on New Zealand in the Champions Trophy 2025 final in Dubai on Sunday, March 9. Team India enter the game as favourites, having won seven ODIs in a row en route to the final. However, India do not enjoy a great record against New Zealand when it comes to tournament finals. In fact, the men in blue have not beaten the Kiwis in an international cricket final since 1988. India and New Zealand have faced off twice in the final of a major senior ICC event, and the Black Caps have won on both occasions. Overall, New Zealand lead India 3-1 when it comes to finals in international cricket. The first instance of a New Zealand win came during the 2000 ICC KnockOut Cup final (the previous name of Champions Trophy), which is the only instance of New Zealand winning an ICC final in white ball cricket. On that occasion, New Zealand beat India by four wickets in a closely-fought game. More recently, New Zealand beat India in the World Test Championship (WTC) 2021 final. In between, New Zealand also beat India in the final of a tri-series in 2005, which also featured Zimbabwe. Therefore, the last time India beat New Zealand in a final came in the Sharjah Cup final in 1988. In that game, India won by 52 runs with former India head coach Ravi Shastri starring in an all-round performance. That makes it 37 years since India beat New Zealand in a final in international cricket. Should India beat New Zealand in the final, this will be...",

The Starship rocket also failed minutes after launching from SpaceX's Texas facility in January, with falling debris causing damage to properties on the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean. Newsweek has contacted SpaceX for comment. What to Know Starship, the world's biggest rocket, exploded minutes after it took off from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas, on Thursday. According to SpaceX, Starship's huge first-stage booster, known as Super Heavy, successfully deployed 33 Raptor engines upon takeoff and propelled the rocket through its first-stage ascent. Starship then lit its six engines and separated from the Super Heavy booster to continue its ascent to space. While Super Heavy was able return itself to the launch site, an \"energetic event\" saw Starship lose several of its engines, according to SpaceX. This resulted in a loss of attitude control and communication. Final contact with Starship came approximately nine minutes and 30 seconds after takeoff. SpaceX said the rocket experienced a \"rapid unscheduled disassembly\" before contact was lost. Debris from the rocket was seen falling from the skies in Florida and the Caribbean.

Curry was 38 feet from the basket with 0.3 seconds left in the first half when he turned and scored, on his way to a 40-point haul. \"Most people can make that shot luckily,\" team-mate Draymond Green said. \"We all knew that shot was going in. That's a different thing. It's like watching Cirque du Soleil or something.\" \"That one, that's not in the practice routine,\" Curry said. \"It did surprise me, though.

He was injured taking the catch to dismiss Heinrich Klaasen in the 29th over but after spending time off the field returned to bowl two further overs. Pace bowler Jacob Duffy or fast-bowling all-rounder Nathan Smith would be the most likely replacements for Henry if he is not passed fit. \"It was pretty uncomfortable,\" Stead said. \"The positive thing for us is he got back out there to bowl. \"We are going to give him every chance to be playing in this match.\" New Zealand arrived back in Dubai on Thursday after playing their semi-final in Lahore a day earlier.

A comical own goal by Lucas Bergvall in the 18th minute proved enough for AZ to register a first victory over an English club in 12 attempts. Bergvall tried to clear Troy Parrott’s shot but only contrived to slice the ball up and over Djed Spence on the goal line. Despite eight days to prepare for this crucial fixture, Spurs failed to produce an adequate response and did not register a shot on target until the 88th minute. It was a thoroughly disappointing performance, especially given this competition remains the club’s last hope of silverware this term, and they have work to do to turn the tie around in the second leg in north London. “We’ll analyse it and have a look at the areas where we struggled with, but it’s fair to say it was nowhere near the level it needed to be,” Postecoglou said. “It wasn’t great from us tonight. Pretty much all facets of the game. We didn’t really get to grips with any part of the game. We struggled to gain any momentum with the ball, we weren’t as aggressive as we needed to be without the ball. “I don’t think it’s a matter of effort or attitude. I don’t think it is going out there and not trying, but, like I said, we didn’t really come to grips and have the right mindset to tackle an away fixture in Europe “It is always tough and we obviously conceded the goal, which was a...",

        "content": "Raise your hand if you saw this coming. When Audi unveiled the new A6 earlier this week, we had to do a double take to spot the differences from the smaller A5. Sure, the exterior has a few subtle tweaks beyond the bigger body, but inside? It’s borderline identical. In fact, the base A6 has that odd design choice we called out on its smaller sibling nearly a year ago. Skip the optional passenger screen, and you’re left with this. I might be making a big deal out of a minor issue, but it’s clear Audi really wants you to spring for the 10.9-inch display. I had hoped that with the A6 being the fancier car, things would be different. As they did with the A5 , the Four Rings claim the touchscreen is \"perfectly integrated into the dashboard design,” but that’s debatable. Its role is to cure boredom by allowing the passenger sitting next to the driver to access websites and stream video content. Additionally, the person can also look for the nearest gas station. Seeing the glass half full, at least it’s not a distraction for the driver. The third screen's content remains hidden from view behind the wheel, thanks to a privacy mode. When the car notices there's no front passenger or the display isn’t in use, an image is shown instead. On the base A6, however, you’re left with a glossy black plastic panel—perhaps a subtle reminder that paying Audi extra for the screen might have been the better choice. Even with the passenger display, one issue remains—thick bezels that feel more...",

The post on the X account of Pope Francis was sent out on Tuesday ahead of Ash Wednesday, the start of the season of Lent when the foreheads of Roman Catholics are marked with the ashes of burnt palm leaves. \"The #Ashes remind us of who we are, which does us good,\" the message started. England Cricket's account reposted it along with the message, \"Even @Pontifex loves the Ashes\", a reference to the Ashes rivalry between the England and Australia cricket teams. \"This was an ill-judged post and was swiftly deleted,\" an ECB spokesman said. \"We apologise for any offence.\" Pope Francis, an Argentine soccer fan, on Thursday sent his first audio message since being taken to hospital nearly three weeks ago, expressing thanks to well-wishers from around the world who had offered him their support. The next edition of the Ashes cricket series, which gets its name from a satirical obituary published in a British newspaper after Australia first won a test in England in 1882, takes place later this year.",

Both India and New Zealand have consistently been among the main contenders for the big titles in cricket for over the past decade or so and former England captain Nasser Hussain has said that the Kiwis are no pushovers. India stand a chance at winning a second ICC title in less than a year, having beaten South Africa in the final of the T20 World Cup last year. South Africa, who are still trying to shed the ingominous tag of “chokers” when they play big tournament, had lost the match despite needing just 30 runs to win off the last five overs of the match. Hussain said that New Zealand probably will be a tougher cookie to crack in those situations. “They will not bottle it, they won't choke. We were having dinner with [former Australia captain] Aaron Finch and he summed it up pretty well in saying New Zealand are never a side that beat themselves. And by that, he means that they will rock up and they will put in a performance,\" said Hussain on Sky Sports. \"All the way through the New Zealand lineup they have some very, very tough cricketers who turn up to every single game and give it their absolute best - that's why they will always be there around semi-finals and finals.\" New Zealand's incredible run in Pakistan New Zealand have been in sensational form throughout their tour of Pakistan....",

The decision to move the 33-year-old was made Thursday afternoon, and before the night was over, Nelson was a member of the Avalanche. Colorado acquired Nelson from the Islanders while they were in the process of stomping the last-place San Jose Sharks at Ball Arena. In return, general manager Chris MacFarland sent New York top prospect Calum Ritchie, defenseman Oliver Kylington, a first-round draft pick, and a conditional third-round pick.

Before it was halfway through, both the Isles and Avalanche made the deal official. As for the players and coaching staff who were still mid-game, they didn’t hear about the news until after the final buzzer. The consensus around the team is excitement. Starting with the head coach, who had perhaps the most in-depth breakdown of Colorado’s newest addition. “It’s a huge add. Huge add,” Jared Bednar said. “Looking at how hard it is, come playoff time, and you’re adding a player of Brock’s caliber, center position, big, long, strong, can skate, highly productive, getting better with age. “He’s always been a trusted 200-foot player.

He noted the ongoing free trade agreement negotiations between India and the EU, spanning nearly 23 years, expressing optimism about finalising it by year-end. \"The second aspect of it is, of course, Ireland as a member of the European Union. And here we have been negotiating and I'm afraid we've been negotiating quite long, almost 23 years now for a free trade agreement. We just had a visit of the EU president with 21 commissioners to India, and we are perhaps a little bit more hopeful now that this exercise would be brought to an end, ideally by the conclusion of this year. Now, I do want to share with you all our view that we find today increasing convergences with Europe as India becomes a bigger economy. We are the fifth currently, we will be the third definitely by the end of this decade. There is a lot that we see going on with Europe, and again Ireland as an integral part of that, would obviously reap the benefits,\" Jaishankar said.

The president won't be released from prison immediately because prosecutors have the right to file an appeal, Mr Yoon's lawyer said. If he is released from prison, the court ruling will allow Mr Yoon to face his criminal trial while not being physically detained between hearings. The president was arrested and indicted in January for rebellion, in connection with his 3 December martial law decree. The move sparked chaos in Seoul before it was voted down by lawmakers and rescinded in a matter of hours. Mr Yoon has claimed he was acting to root out \"anti-state\" elements and that he never intended to fully impose emergency military rule. Mr Yoon's lawyers had argued the warrant issued on 19 January was invalid because the request filed by prosecutors was procedurally flawed. \"South Korea's rule of law is still alive,\" Mr Yoon's legal counsel said, shortly after Seoul Central District Court made the ruling on Friday. The president's office welcomed the court’s decision, saying it hopes Mr Yoon “will return to work soon”. The court said it accepted the president's request to be released from jail because the legal period of his formal arrest expired before he was indicted. The bench noted that there were \"questions about the legality\" of the investigation process...",

The red-hot Lakers extended their unbeaten streak to eight games in a pulsating battle at the Crypto.com Arena that saw Doncic finish with 32 points while James poured in 31. Doncic and James had both been instrumental in dragging the Lakers back into the contest after the Knicks led by 10 points midway through the fourth quarter. The Knicks meanwhile were left ruing a potential victory that slipped through their fingers despite a majestic performance from Jalen Brunson, who scored a game-high 39 points. The agony of the Knicks' defeat was compounded by an injury to Brunson in overtime, with the mercurial point guard limping off the court after rolling his right ankle in a collision with the Lakers' Austin Reaves. \"Our physicality in the fourth quarter was next level,\" an exhausted Doncic said afterwards. \"Once we got started, we played basketball. \"They're a great team with great players and it's a tough win. We've got eight in a row now and every game is a battle for us.\" The Lakers looked to be struggling after trailing for most of the game against a fired-up Knicks, who led by as much as 13 at one stage. But after struggling for shooting accuracy for most of the contest, the Lakers began making shots in the fourth quarter. James bagged a crucial pair of three-pointers while Gabe Vincent...",

        "content": "Feminist activists in Spain say inaction and men's silence are hindering the eradication of abuse, as the country celebrates 20 years of a pioneering law against gender-based violence. The murder of Ana Orantes, a 60-year-old woman who had reported violence against her to the authorities and on television before being burned alive by her ex-husband in 1997, shocked the nation into action. Parliament ended up adopting a law that entered into force in 2005 and recognised gender-based violence as a human rights violation for the first time, inspiring other countries. The legislation laid the ground for a range of new support measures for women, including specialised courts, free legal assistance, emergency housing, prosecution even if the victim did not submit a complaint and tags keeping abusers away from the victim. It was the first law in Spain to be conceived with an explicit gender-based perspective, punishing abuse perpetrated by males against their partners or ex-partners. For lawyer and activist Altamira Gonzalo, the law stood out by aiming to \"undermine the patriarchal structure of society, which is what allows and perpetuates inequality and therefore violence\". It was the first European law which sought to change different areas including the health system, media, advertising and \"all those aspects of life in which inequality between men and women is reflected\", Gonzalo added. The measures helped bring down the number of femicides, which in 2024 dropped to a low of 48...",

        "content": "Gene Hackman ’s time of death could be “impossible” to determine, a medical examiner has claimed. Chief Medical Examiner for Connecticut Dr James Gill – who isn’t working directly on the case – has stressed the importance of finding more clues to how Gene and his wife Betsy Arakawa died at their Santa Fe home, along with one of their dogs. Hollywood veteran Gene, 95, and Betsy, 64, are thought to have been dead for at least 10 days before they were discovered. But Dr Gill explained: “Once you get to that mummification stage, there’s nothing to be able to distinguish the two deaths timewise. “Generally, dry environments will cause mummification to occur more quickly than in a non-dry environment,” he told People magazine. Forensic pathologist Judy Melinek added to the publication: “Once the body is decomposed, it’s a lot harder to do.” While early indicators like rigor mortis and body temperature can help to establish a time of death in the first stages, that’s a lot harder to deal with once the bodies are actively decomposing. Betsy was found on the bathroom floor of their home next to a fallen space heater, while Gene’s body was discovered in the mudroom. Their dog Zinna had been crated at the time and is thought to have died from dehydration or starvation. So far, carbon monoxide poisoning has been ruled out as a cause of death. A small gas leak was discovered in the couple’s home, but an investigation concluded it was too small to have killed the couple. Now investigators...",

The airdrop was carried out by the district administration and the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) after an avalanche on Wednesday blocked roads, leaving residents in need of essential services, they said. The Chamba-Tissa main road was also blocked near Pukhri on Thursday due to a landslide, further impacting connectivity, they added. The situation has been particularly tough for patients in the remote Pangi area. A 53-year-old man, Sher Singh of Hudan Batori village, who fell unconscious, had to be carried on a makeshift stretcher for 16 km on snow by local youths from Pangi to Killar, where he was hospitalised, reports reaching here said. It took the villagers 10 hours to cover the snow-laden stretch, highlighting the dire situation caused by the weather conditions, officials said. Meanwhile, Himachal Pradesh experienced dry weather in the past 24 hours. Moderate fog was observed in Mandi, while gusty winds swept through Tabo, the meteorological office said.

However, he has temporarily postponed tariffs on Mexican imports until April 2. His main concern is that these nations have failed to prevent the smuggling and illegal trade of Fentanyl, a powerful painkiller. Despite a decline in fentanyl overdose deaths, the tariffs have still been enforced. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the US recorded 87,000 drug overdose deaths between October 2023 and September 2024, down from 114,000 the previous year. But what is fentanyl? Fentanyl has become a major topic of discussion in the medical community, primarily due to its extreme potency and high potential for misuse. While it serves as a life-saving medication for some, it has also contributed to a global opioid crisis due to its illicit use. According to Dr Palleti Siva Karthik Reddy, consultant physician at Koshys Hospitals, Bengaluru, fentanyl is a synthetic opioid analgesic, meaning it is a lab-made painkiller that mimics natural opioids like morphine, but is far more potent. \"It belongs to the class of mu-opioid receptor agonists, meaning it binds to opioid receptors in the brain, altering pain perception and inducing euphoria and sedation,\" he explains. Initially synthesised in the 1960s by Dr Paul Janssen, fentanyl was designed for severe pain management in medical settings. However, in recent decades, its illicit...",

The 31-year-old, who secured gold medals at both the London 2012 and Rio 2016 Olympics, has announced her retirement from taekwondo to pursue a professional boxing career. Jones will be training in Liverpool under the guidance of Stephen Smith , a former British and Commonwealth champion. “Taekwondo has given me everything – an incredible journey, unforgettable memories and the honour of representing my country on the biggest stage,” Jones said. However, she is eager to embrace a new sport. “I’ve given everything to taekwondo and I’m now ready for a new challenge. Boxing has always fascinated me and I’m excited to test myself in a completely different arena.” Jones said she is ready to push her boundaries, despite the uncertainties ahead. “I know it won’t be easy and, if I’m being honest, I don’t really know what to expect, but I thrive on pushing myself beyond my limits and am excited by [the] journey ahead.” Jones's taekwondo career began with a victory at the age of 19, winning gold in the -57kg category at the London 2012 Olympics. She replicated this success in Rio four years later and captured a world title in Manchester in 2019. Her preparations for her fourth Olympic Games in Paris were marred by controversy surrounding a missed drugs test . However, UK Anti-Doping ultimately cleared her of any wrongdoing, citing a no-fault violation due to confidential medical...",

The show was dedicated to the theme of rising air pollution in Mumbai. Vineeth joked during the show, “Would you rather watch your parents breathe the 2.5 pm particulate or get the government to participate and solve it forever?” The comedian received huge applause and cheer from his audience. The comedian later talked about the bad air quality in Mumbai. He also compared the air quality with smoking cigarettes, claiming that breathing in Mumbai is like ‘smoking 2.9 cigarettes per day'. Vineeth also agreed that it will indeed save a smoker ₹60 a day. Besides Vineeth, other comedians also graced the comedy stage, including “Daniel Fernandes, Aditi Mittal, Raunaq Rajani, Aadar Malik and Supriya Joshi.

        "content": "Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah , while presenting his record 16th budget on Friday, strongly defended the state’s five guarantee schemes and attributed fiscal challenges to the Union government. He also underscored that the budget remains “development-oriented.” For the financial year 2025-26, the total estimated expenditure stands at ₹ 4,09,549 crore, comprising ₹ 3,11,739 crore in revenue expenditure, ₹ 71,336 crore in capital expenditure, and ₹ 26,474 crore allocated for loan repayment.

(Also Read: Karnataka Budget 2025: Bengaluru to get 9,000 new electric buses as state focuses on green public transport ) The government has the responsibility to ensure that available resources are accessible to everyone, by balancing economic development with people's welfare. The administration was shaping Karnataka's development model through the concept of \"Universal Basic Income\", said Siddaramaiah. “Many of the welfare programs, including the Five Guarantees, are not merely freebies but strategic investments based on economic and social principles, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said in his budget speech. He emphasized that these schemes aim to address deep-rooted social inequalities and uplift marginalized communities,” he said. Citing Muzaffar Assadi, a renowned scholar from the state, Siddaramaiah stated, \"Behind the guarantee schemes lie the suffering of the poor, the...",

Whether you’ve been waiting to pull the trigger on a triple captain and figuring out the best time to deploy the new assistant manager chip the basics remain the same and selecting in form players is the true way to build high-scoring squads. There were some surprising inclusions in the team of the week from Gameweek 27 including Ispwich’s Jaden Philogene and Everton ’s Jake O'Brien but other options were almost guaranteed to notch up big scores. Below we’ve selected five players who we think could come good this weekend and may be useful for the weeks ahead: Goalkeeper - Mark Flekken (Brentford, £4.4m) A cheaper option which may prove useful to differentiate your team from those around you in the league. Clean sheets have been hard to come by for most goalkeepers this season with plenty of goals being scored left and right in the English top flight. Flekken is is good form though having shut out both West Ham and Leicester in two of Brentford ’s three most recent games (and he only conceded one against Everton). The main draw here is the Bees next couple of opponents. Aston Villa will be a tough test but they will have one eye on their Champions...",

To help professionals navigate this challenge, a Kerala-based techie, Abhishek Nair, shared six key reasons why most job seekers fail to secure employment. His insights, based on personal experience and mentoring candidates, have sparked widespread discussion online. (Also read: Techie with decade of experience in US struggles to find job in India: ‘Need to support aging parent’ ) In a detailed post on X, Nair recounted a conversation with a recruiter friend who revealed why 90% of candidates struggle to get hired. The six biggest mistakes job seekers make 1. Zero practical experience “In today’s world, where it’s easier than ever to build websites and projects, if your resume or portfolio lacks solid projects, you don’t deserve a job. You don’t need to build the next Facebook or Twitter – but a calculator app won’t cut it either,” Nair advised, urging professionals to develop meaningful projects. 2. Applying blindly Many job seekers send out resumes indiscriminately, hoping for a response. However, Nair warned against this approach, calling it a sign of desperation. 3. Zero personal brand “If your only presence online is a private Instagram account and a LinkedIn profile with 12 connections, you’re invisible to recruiters,” Nair pointed out. He suggested that job seekers stand out by showcasing their work online, sharing...",

        "content": "A tearful Nick Kyrgios was forced to retire from his first-round Indian Wells match with a wrist injury as his tennis return suffered another setback. The Australian, playing his first match since January's Australian Open, trailed Botic van de Zandschulp 7-6 (9-7) 3-0 before ending the match early. Kyrgios became visibly upset when speaking to the trainer about his right wrist, which he had surgery on in September 2023. The 29-year-old also struggled with knee and foot injuries over an 18-month period before making his return at the start of the year. \"No-one in the sport has had a wrist reconstruction and tried to play after that,\" Kyrgios said. \"There's been players that have had wrist surgeries and nowhere near as bad as what I had. \"It's all an experiment at this point. I was told I was arguably maybe not ever playing tennis again. \"I feel I'm like right there, I feel like I can compete.\" Kyrgios, runner-up at Wimbledon in 2022, had cut short a practice session earlier in the week after feeling pain in his wrist. He came back from 4-1 down in the first set against Dutchman Van de Zandschulp and had a set point in the tie-break before he began to physically struggle. Kyrgios is scheduled to play the Miami Open, which begins on 18 March, but said he would see how his wrist responds before making a decision. \"We go back to the drawing board as a team and we try and figure out a way to get through these matches,\" Kyrgios added. \"I would have loved to be able to finish that...",

On,” the always fiery 70-year-old Michigan State coach said in October. The Spartans responded by defying critics and outside expectations, putting together another banner-raising season. With a 91-84 win at Iowa on Thursday night , No. 8 Michigan State (25-5, 16-3) secured an outright Big Ten championship. “Am I happy we won the Big Ten? I’m ecstatic, I’ll be ecstatic when I walk out of this building until I get to the plane,” Izzo said while noting the focus will quickly shift to Sunday’s regular-season finale against No. 17 Michigan as the Spartans look for a season sweep. Michigan State’s first Big Ten title in five years is the 11th regular-season crown for Izzo to tie Bob Knight and Ward “Piggy” Lambert for the record. The latest career milestone for the coach in his 30th year leading the Spartans is a first for the current squad that opened the season unranked and now has a title. “It was definitely one of my goals to start the season,” senior guard Jaden Akins said, “so I’m happy to be able to check that off and now be able to move forward to other goals.” The mottos – “Strength in Numbers” and “Be Different” – have been staples all season and continued Thursday night at Carver-Hawkeye Arena.

        "content": "U.S. tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as signals about comfortable supply levels have combined to pressure oil into ending the week with a substantial loss, which, according to was the biggest one since last October. At the time of writing was trading at $69.48 per barrel and was changing hands for $66.33 per barrel even as President Trump temporarily the 25% tariff rate he imposed on Canada and Mexico earlier in the week. The suspension is in effect until April 4. Canadian oil exports were not covered by the suspension. “It looks like the financial markets are in full panic mode, no longer easily pacified by Trump’s one-month postponements and exemptions on import tariffs,” energy analyst Vandana Hari told Reuters, adding that “That leaves crude stuck around four-month lows, albeit vulnerable to further slides.” Earlier in the week, media reported that OPEC+ had decided to go ahead with its planned partial reversal of oil production cuts at its next meeting, in early April. The rollback is minor, at less than 200,000 barrels daily, but it seems that oil traders are so nervous about supply right now even that small change in OPEC+ output is enough to tank prices. A robust state of U.S. oil inventories contributed to the price slide this week, with the Energy Information Administration a weekly build of some 3.6 million barrels, although it was accompanied by inventory dips in both gasoline and middle distillates.

While the couple has yet to address the rumour, Tamannaah opened up on her idea of love and relationships on Luke Coutinho’s podcast . Here’s what she said. (Also Read: Amid wedding buzz, Vijay Varma and Tamannaah Bhatia part ways: Report ) Tamannaah Bhatia on love and relationships Tamannaah was asked about her take on love, and she stated that she believes love can only be unconditional, be it when it comes to a partner, parents, friends or even pets. She also stated that relationships, on the other hand, turn into ‘business transactions’ when you begin to have expectations from a partner. She said, “I think people confuse between what love is and what a relationship is. The moment it is conditional, I feel it ceases to be love. Love can only be unconditional; it can only be ek tarfah (one-sided). Love is an inside job, it’s how you feel for someone. The moment you have expectations, you want people to do what you want them to be doing, then that's just a business transaction. I’ve realised if I have to love someone, I need to let them free, to be who they are.” Tamannaah also shared that she has ‘always been much happier’ when she’s in a relationship versus when single. But she’s guarded about whom she lets in her personal space, stating, “I feel like I've always been much more happier when I'm in a relationship versus when I'm not.

It’s almost strange because a foldable iPhone is expected, yet there has been no clear indication of when it might arrive. Some speculate a 2026 release, while others suggest it could be pushed to 2027. There are also reports that Apple might release a foldable iPad first.

        "content": "Spain, a European renewable energy leader, is coming under increasing pressure from the right and business groups to reverse its plans to phase out its nuclear power plants by 2035. At the height of enthusiasm for nuclear power in the 1980s, Spain had eight nuclear plants providing 38 percent of its electricity. Now it has five, providing 20 percent of its power. Under the country's nuclear phase-out plans, agreed in 2019 under the government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, these remaining plants will be closed over the next decade, as the country focuses instead on green energy sources such as solar and wind power. But as the planned closure of the country's oldest and most powerful atomic plant at Almaraz in western Spain in 2027-28 approaches, calls are growing for Spain to follow in the footsteps of other European countries that are reviving their nuclear power. The two reactors at Almaraz generate around seven percent of the total electricity produced in the European Union's fourth-largest economy. Spain's decision to close its plants \"was adopted in a completely different industrial, geopolitical, social and economic context\" and no longer makes sense without \"a viable alternative,\" the Nuclear Forum lobby group that represents the sector said in a statement. Atomic power will be needed to meet Spain's electricity needs as demand will soar due to growing sales of electric vehicles and the expansion of data centres to accommodate the greater use of AI, it...",

The Red Bull F1 CEO has been front-and-centre of countless episodes in the past six seasons, gladly playing the role of F1’s pantomime villain, with numerous scenes filmed at his country mansion home in Oxfordshire, alongside Spice Girl wife Geri Halliwell . Season seven is no different. The latest instalment, chronicling the 2024 season, begins with Horner at the wheel of his 4x4, locked in conversation with Geri about a record-breaking 2023 campaign , in which Red Bull won 21 out of 22 races. With an air of inevitability synonymous with Netflix’s exquisitely curated narratives, Geri strikes a warning to her husband: “You never know what life’s going to bring.” In actual fact, we all know what’s coming next. The latest chapter in the Drive to Survive behemoth, premiering on Friday 7 March, peaks unquestionably at the start. Episode one, titled “Business as Usual”, captures through a fresh lens the two biggest stories in F1 this time 12 months ago: Lewis Hamilton ’s swashbuckling 2025 move to Ferrari (starter), and Horner being accused of “inappropriate behaviour” by a female colleague (main course). Red Bull’s impressive launch of their 20th F1 car last year in Milton Keynes sets the scene. And credit to the team, firstly, for providing media access from all angles amid a torrid period off-track for the then-world champions. The episode then skips to Bahrain,...",

Addressing the 56th Raising Day of the CISF at RTC Thakkolam in Tamil Nadu's Ranipet, Shah said that it was Prime Minister Narendra Modi that CISF aspirants could now write their exam papers in their respective languages. \"Earlier, there was no place for your mother tongue in CAPF exams. You could not write CAPF exam in Bengali, Kannada or in Tamil languages but PM Modi decided that now candidates can appear for the CAPF exams in their mother tongue as well,\" Shah said in his address. \"I appeal to the Tamil Nadu chief minister to start the engineering and medical education in Tamil in the state for the benefit of students,\" Amit Shah further said. The Home Minister's remarks came after the CM Stalin said that the National Education Policy 2020 was like \"an LKG student lecturing a PhD holder\", claiming that the state has already achieved several of the new policy's goals. Hitting back at Stalin, Tamil Nadu BJP chief K Annamalai said that the Chief Minister should \"stop swinging his paper word\" against the \"delusional\" Hindi imposition in the state. \"Your fake Hindi imposition drama has already been exposed. It's unfortunate that you haven't realized it yet,\" he said on X. The two leaders have been at a war of words over the alleged Hindi imposition through the three-language formula in...",

The Seoul central district court accepted Yoon’s petition to cancel his custody in a ruling delivered on Friday, though the president still faces the serious criminal charges that could result in life imprisonment or even the death penalty if convicted. Ahead of his potential return, police and Yoon supporters were seen gathering around the presidential residence in the capital. Yoon has been detained in Seoul detention centre since 15 January, when investigators dramatically executed an arrest warrant after an initial failed attempt that saw presidential security forces block police from entering his residence . In a statement, Yoon’s legal team welcomed the court’s decision as confirming “that the rule of law is still alive in this country” and demanded that “prosecutors should immediately order the president’s release”. His team argued that keeping him detained during the seven-day period in which prosecutors can appeal would be unconstitutional. On Friday, the court ruled that prosecutors had indicted Yoon after his legal detention period had expired, calculating that the 10-day detention limit had passed when counting actual hours rather than full days. The court also cited procedural errors, including how the...",

        "content": "US President Donald Trump repeated his criticism of India’s high tariffs, indicating the country remains a target of reciprocal duties set to take effect April 2. “India’s a very high tariff nation,” Trump said Thursday during an Oval Office event, calling the upcoming reciprocal tariffs “the big one” among the many new duties he has pledged. India is expected to be hit hard by the like-for-like duties given the high tariffs it charges when compared with the US. Trump’s remarks are the latest criticism of India’s trade barriers, which the US president has said unfairly penalize American businesses. The remarks come as Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal visits the US this week to meet with Trump administration officials to discuss trade policy between the two countries. At a White House meeting in February, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump agreed to boost their bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030 and negotiate a trade deal by the fall of this year. Indian officials are hoping that ongoing discussions toward such a deal will give the country a reprieve from the April 2 duties. Trump hasn’t indicated whether any countries will be exempted from the reciprocal tariffs. However, the US president on Thursday offered major reprieves to Mexico and Canada, the US’s two largest trading partners, by exempting goods from those nations that are covered by the North American trade agreement known as USMCA from his 25% tariffs. Modi’s government has made numerous...",

It's making broad, sweeping claims not just on better general picture performance (in everything from improved color accuracy to higher brightness) but also several AI enhancements thanks to webOS 25.It's the same mistake I felt LG made last year with the LG G4 OLED: This is a great-looking TV, but I'm still not convinced a slew of AI enhancements is the sort of upgrade that most folks expect when spending $2,000 or more on a new TV.Getting to grips with this 4K upscaling guru(Image credit: Tom's Guide)To get a closer look at LG's C5 OLED, I traveled to a press event at LG's North American HQ in New Jersey. Much of the trip was focused on the LG G5 OLED, which we first saw at CES 2025, but LG's C5 OLED demo focused on its upscaling chops.

The Delhi high court in September 2024 granted Wadhawan medical bail. A bench of Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar issued notice on the CBI’s appeal against the high court order, seeking a response by the last week of April when the next hearing is scheduled. Additional solicitor general SV Raju, representing the agency, said Wadhawan is a 45-year-old man with no history of serious ailments. “He is a man with money bags...he procured reports from private hospitals and secured the relief,” Raju said. Senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing Wadhawan, cited medical reports detailing ailments. He added that his client had issues with kidneys, spine, and heart. The DHFL case is considered one of the biggest banking frauds in India, involving the alleged misappropriation of ₹ 34,000 crore. The CBI said Wadhawan and his brother Kapil Wadhawan diverted funds from banks to entities under their control by sanctioning loans without due diligence or adequate security, manipulating the company’s financial records to conceal their fraudulent activities. The Wadhawan brothers were arrested in July 2022. On December 3 of that year, a trial court granted them statutory bail, saying the CBI’s charge sheet...",

Aspinall endured a troublesome night with the Brighton crowd but battled through to move up to third in the table after week five. The Asp started his night by cruising past point-less Stephen Bunting 6-2 before completing a stunning comeback to pip Rob Cross 6-5, having trailed 4-2 when Voltage hit a nine-darter. He fell short against Littler, who triumphed 6-3 to win his second night of the competition and move two points behind Luke Humphries at the summit. However, unsavoury scenes struck before their latest clash when a rowdy fan aimed a pint at Aspinall from the crowd. The 33-year-old boasts one of the most popular walk-ons in darts, never failing to get fans in attendance going with The Killers' 'Mr Brightside'. It was no different at the Brighton Centre, orchestrating an impassioned rendition three times on the south coast. But the third turned sour. Sky Sports cameras showed a stern-looking Aspinall deep in conversation with referee Huw Ware after taking to the stage for the final against Littler. And The Nuke has since claimed it was because the TV coverage missed a pint of beer being aimed at Aspinall from the masses below the oche. In his post-match press conference, Littler explained: \"I think there was a pint thrown at Nathan as soon as he came up on the stage. Crazy.\" The 18-year-old had to correct...",

The suburban RER B train service confirmed on X (formerly Twitter) that the bomb dated back to the Second World War.

According to Eurostar’s official website, at least three morning departures were canceled as a precaution. Passengers traveling to London, Brussels, and other destinations faced significant delays.

        "content": "Did you know that not all fats are the same? While most of us focus on losing weight to stay healthy, research suggests that where your body stores fat and in what proportion can have a major impact on overall health. It turns out that shedding kilos isn’t the only thing that matters, understanding how fat is distributed in your body is just as important. (Also read: Woman who lost 54 kg reveals mistakes she made on her PCOS weight loss journey: ‘I went 100% gluten and dairy-free’ ) A study published in BMC Medicine by researchers from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, along with international collaborators, revealed surprising insights into visceral fat, the fat that surrounds internal organs. The study found that its impact on health varies depending on whether it’s measured by its absolute area or in proportion to other fat stores. Why fat distribution matters more than just BMI For years, doctors have known visceral fat is more harmful than subcutaneous fat. This study reveals new insights into obesity-related risks, emphasizing the importance of fat distribution over total fat loss. “These findings provide a new way to evaluate weight loss , focusing on what fat is lost and its impact on metabolic health,” says study author Iris Shai. Analyzing 572 participants over 18 months, researchers found that while the visceral fat area was linked to inflammation and insulin resistance, its proportion was associated with high triglycerides. Notably, participants lost 22.5%...",

The hearing took place at the Federal Anti-Corruption Court in Karachi, where Gilani appeared before the judge in person. During the proceedings, the judge addressed Gilani, saying that a verdict had been reached in three cases against him. Gilani responded affirmatively, acknowledging the decision. At one point, the court asked Gilani which prison he would prefer —Karachi, Multan, or Islamabad. In response, the Senate chairman said that he had no fear of jail, adding: \"Prison is nothing new for us. If you wish, you may even sentence me to death.\" His remarks prompted a smile from the presiding judge. The court further inquired why he did not prefer house arrest, to which Gilani replied that his ancestral home was in Multan, his family resided in Lahore, and his Senate office was in Islamabad. When the judge pointed out that the trial was being conducted in Karachi, Gilani remarked: \"Then people will say my party has a government in Sindh.\" Announcing the verdict, the court declared that no charges against Gilani had been proven, granting him an honourable acquittal. The judge further noted that those who had testified against him were now facing charges themselves. Following the completion of the trial in three cases, the court acquitted Gilani and 40 other accused individuals from the...",

Devina highlights the significant drop in stock prices, stating that 85% of stocks are down by more than 25%, despite the index not reflecting the full extent of the losses. She emphasizes the unpredictability and volatility in small-cap stocks and advises against relying on them for recovery. Devina mentions that the pain in the market may be behind, particularly for large-cap stocks. She cautions that staying out of the market now could result in missing out on potential upswings and that investors should stay invested with a long-term perspective. Pointer: Devina addresses concerns around US tariffs, particularly on Indian pharma. She suggests that while Trump's tariffs may have short-term effects, India is less impacted due to its smaller export share. She also underscores that geopolitical risks, like Trump’s unpredictable actions, add uncertainty to the global market. Devina highlights her portfolio’s exposure to ITC and AkzoNobel. She is cautiously adding some FMCG names as the consumption sector recovers. However, she still holds a selective view, particularly avoiding paints and real estate sectors.

In its submission to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) made on March 5, NASSCOM warned that restrictions on data flows could discourage investment, impact global competitiveness, and increase compliance costs for companies operating across jurisdictions. NASSCOM’s concerns carry weight, given that India’s IT and digital industries rely heavily on seamless data transfers for global operations, including cloud computing, AI services, and multinational business processes. Nasscom said that limiting Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs) from transferring personal data outside India contradicted the broader intent of the DPDP Act and could create regulatory uncertainty for businesses. The DPDP Act was passed in the Parliament in August 2023. The rules essentially act as the operating guidelines for implementing the Act. The draft rules were released for consultation on January 3, and the deadline for submitting comments was March 5. \"The new proposal in the Draft Rules to restrict cross-border transfers for Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDF) appears inconsistent with the spirit and objectives of the Act and should be reconsidered,\" NASSCOM stated.

He is putting a lot of emphasis on tech and on the use of tech as a game changer in global politics. That offers a lot of possibilities for us.”Jaishankar noted that the US administration under Trump is actively moving towards multipolarity, a shift that aligns with India’s vision for the future. “We see a president and an administration moving towards multipolarity, and that is something which suits India.”India and the US: A Relationship Built on Shared InterestsUnlike some nations that have had a complicated history with the US, India has maintained a steady and constructive relationship with Washington. Jaishankar explained that this has allowed both nations to focus on shared priorities. “We have never had any issues with American presidents, at least in recent times,” he said.One of the key aspects of this relationship is the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), comprising the US, India, Australia, and Japan.

Donald Trump on Friday hosts top cryptocurrency players at the White House, a political boost for an industry that has struggled to gain legitimacy -- and where the Republican president faces conflict of interest concerns. US crypto investors were major supporters of Trump's presidential campaign, contributing millions of dollars toward his victory in hopes of ending the Biden administration's deep skepticism toward digital currencies. Trump also has significant financial ties to the sector, partnering with exchange platform World Liberty Financial and launching the \"Trump\" memecoin in January, as did his wife Melania. The president's \"crypto czar\", Silicon Valley investor David Sacks, has invited prominent founders, CEOs and investors along with members of a Trump working group, to craft policies aimed at accelerating crypto growth, and providing legitimacy that the industry has long sought. On Thursday night, Trump signed an executive order establishing a \"Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,\" a move that Sacks said made good on a campaign promise to an increasingly important component of his coalition.

It has been a tale of missed opportunities for UP Warriorz. Apart from a few individual flashes of brilliance, they have failed to fire collectively. With just four points from seven matches, UPW are languishing at the bottom of the table and are only mathematically in contention. Defending champions RCB have also endured a tough season, with four points from six games and are coming on the back of four defeats on the trot. However, they have a game in hand over UP Warriorz, keeping their playoff hopes alive as Smriti Mandhana and Co will need to put their best foot forward. The heartbreak of their Super Over loss in their last encounter will be still fresh in their minds, and they will be keen to settle the scores. UP Warriorz batting order has been far from settled with frequent changes, especially at the top in the last three games. They have experimented with at least one overseas batter as an opener, but the strategy has yielded little success. While India's Kiran Navgire has been a constant in the top-three with mixed results, Grace Harris had an impactful innings, and Georgia Voll produced a sensational knock against Mumbai Indians in their last match.

The Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) said it would introduce fluoridation to more areas of north-east England. The plans had been out for public consultation last year. The DHSC said it hoped the move would cut the number of children admitted to hospital for tooth decay operations. The British Dental Association (BDA) said it \"welcomed\" the move. Dr Lucy O'Malley at the University of Manchester said the scheme would likely benefit children but there was no evidence water fluoridation reduced oral health inequalities. This meant other measures needed to be put in place as well, she said. Alongside its plans to increase water fluoridation in the North East, DHSC also announced a major nationwide supervised toothbrushing scheme . Prof Anne-Marie Glenny, also from the University of Manchester, said the widespread availability of fluoride toothpaste made the impact of fluoridating water less significant. \"While this effect is less than in the past and may not be felt on an individual level, this still may represent an important population level effect,\" she said. She said fluoridating water supplies should be considered against costs and potential harms, and fluoride levels should be \"actively\" monitored.

Both Xi and Modi provided strategic guidance for the improvement of ties at the Kazan meeting, Wang said on the sidelines of the annual session of China’s parliament currently underway here.

The 26-year-old leg-spinner got his chance to bowl to Kohli in the high-stakes India vs Pakistan clash during the 2025 Champions Trophy in Dubai. Although Pakistan suffered a six-wicket defeat, for Abrar, the match also held personal significance. Abrar, who was overlooked in both the 2023 ODI World Cup and the T20 World Cup clash in New York, made an impact with a disciplined spell of 1-28 in his ten overs. More importantly, he held Kohli in check with his tight bowling, ensuring the Indian maestro had to work hard for his runs. Abrar also dismissed Shubman Gill in the game. “My childhood dream of bowling to Kohli has come true in Dubai,” Abrar told Telecom Asia Sport. “It was a great challenge and I took the liberty of teasing him, asking him to hit me a six, but he never got angry. Kohli is a great batter, we all know that. But he is a great human being too.” It was Kohli’s reaction after the match that left Abrar in awe. “He said, ‘well bowled’ after the match, and that made my day,” he added. “I have grown up idolizing Kohli and used to tell Under-19 players that one day I will bowl to him.” The admiration extended beyond just cricketing skills. Abrar was particularly taken aback by Kohli’s supreme fitness and work ethic. “Kohli's fitness is outstanding.

Founders Amarpreet and Sahiba sought ₹1 crore for 1.67% equity, sparking curiosity among the Sharks. The entrepreneurs explained that their product could seamlessly blend into daily meals, making it suitable for all age groups. To demonstrate, they served two bowls of dal—one with their nutritional mix and one without. Surprisingly, none of the Sharks could tell the difference. However, Shark Azhar Iqubal remained skeptical about the product’s efficacy, arguing that relying on such supplements was no different from taking synthetic nutritional aids. Vineeta Singh, a mother herself, strongly resonated with the product’s purpose. She highlighted how picky eating among children is a common household challenge. Sharing her own experience, she mentioned grating nuts into rice for her kids to ensure proper nutrition, acknowledging that Good Monk offered a practical solution for parents. When it came to investment offers, Vineeta pointed out flaws in the brand’s strategy, advising the founders to onboard a celebrity mother as their brand ambassador while cutting unnecessary marketing expenses. She proposed a conditional deal of ₹50 lakh for 1.25% equity, along with ₹50 lakh as debt at a 10% interest rate for three years. However, she set...",

All broadcast interviews are edited, if only for length to fit the format of a program. The suit by Trump is unusual in that it appears to aim at control of editing decisions made by news organizations. Trump filed suit in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas, stating the outlet’s actions violated the Texas Deceptive Practices Trade Act, a law that regulates commercial business practices. CBS responded Thursday, stating the suit lacked the proper venue as well as personal and subject-matter jurisdiction, according to Axios . “Plaintiffs President Donald J. Trump and Representative Ronny Jackson, public officials at the highest ranks of our government, seek to punish a news organization for constitutionally protected editorial judgments they do not like,” CBS attorneys wrote in one of the court documents. “This lawsuit is an affront to...",

Foreign investors are losing confidence in the prime minister of Malaysia,\" reads Malay-language sticker text over a screenshot of a news report shared on TikTok on February 25.

A smaller image with text calling on Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to step down was also inserted into the image. The post includes hashtags reading \"failed government\" and \"Perikatan Nasional\", the main opposition alliance in Malaysia. Though Malaysia's economy grew in 2024, concerns about the economy and cost of living continue to plague Anwar, who recently drew criticism for his frequent travel abroad while neglecting domestic issues ( archived link ).

It was Thursday morning when the blockbuster news was released announcing the third fight between the future Hall of Fame fighters. Taylor and Serrano chose not to take interim fights after their brutal clash in November, which resulted in a unanimous decision victory for Taylor. One of the lasting images from that night was a nasty gash over the eye of Serrano, which was the result of a headbutt. This competitive rivalry has been one of the best things going for women’s boxing, and Netflix has decided to once again partner with MVP to stream the event on their platform. Below is the press release sent out by MVP on Thursday making the trilogy official for July 11 on Netflix. Irish sensation Katie Taylor (24-1, 6 KOs) looks to add another remarkable chapter to her incredible boxing career as she takes on Amanda Serrano for the third time in a historic trilogy. Taylor, a Matchroom fighter and Olympic gold medalist from Bray, Ireland, defeated Serrano at a sold-out Madison Square Garden in April 2022 in a stunning fight of the year contest that saw Taylor successfully defend her then-undisputed lightweight title.

        "content": "Millions of Australians on the east coast are bracing for rarer Cyclone Alfred, which is expected to cause widespread destruction in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. In what's likely to be the first such event in nearly 50 years, Cyclone Alfred poses a threat of dropping significant amounts of rain on a region not equipped to handle such tropical storms. The cyclone, currently a Category 2 system -- which depends on wind intensity -- is exceptional and more powerful because it is slow-moving and originated far too south. What makes it so dangerous Cyclone Alfred is heading towards the southeast coast of Queensland, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology reported. It has continuous winds of 95 km/h around the centre and wind gusts of up to 130 km/h. It is likely to “affect Double Island Point in Queensland to Grafton in New South Wales, including Brisbane, Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Byron Bay and Ballina,” the department added. Cyclones typically affect the northern regions of Australia. The last time a cyclone hit the Gold Coast region was in 1974. Brisbane is the third most populous city in Australia, and the south has a higher population density. This means about 4 million people are in Cyclone Alfred's path, and the infrastructure in this area is not storm-resistant. The Bureau of Meteorology further suggested that Alfred might become a Category 3 storm. However, when the storm hit land, it was predicted to stay on the stronger end of Category 2. With...",

Happiness, it has long been believed, follows a curve: It’s high when one is young, dips in midlife, and then rises again as one gets older. Scratch that – it may no longer be true. Recommended Stories A new research paper based on findings from six English-speaking countries suggests young adults are much less happy than generations before them. The United Nations-commissioned study published by the United States-based National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) reveals a consistent drop in life satisfaction and happiness among young adults in the last decade. Co-authored by San Diego State University psychologist Jean Twenge and Dartmouth University economist David G Blanchflower, the research looked at data collected from 11 surveys across Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the US. But studies from other parts of the world appear to suggest that these results broadly also hold true there. The conclusions of the study by Blanchflower and Twenge upend the long-held belief that happiness follows a U-shaped curve. How significant is this shift – and what’s driving rising unhappiness among youth? What has the research found? The researchers say a decline in unhappiness is especially apparent in younger adults and adolescents aged 12 to 25, many of whom are facing depression and psychological distress at rates that are much...",

The 40 Uyghurs, who had been in Thai custody since 2014 after fleeing state repression of their minority group in China's northwestern Xinjiang region, were whisked away from a Bangkok detention center under cover of darkness last week. We have worked with Thailand for years to avoid this situation, including by consistently and repeatedly offering to resettle the Uyghurs in other countries, including, at times, the United States, the State Department said in response to questions from The Associated Press. Earlier this week, Thailand's Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Russ Jalichandra said there had been no serious offers to take the men. If a third country was really committed to take them, it should also have negotiated with China to welcome Thailand sending them to that third country, he told reporters. The State Department slammed Thailand's decision as a violation of the country's commitment to the United Nations Convention Against Torture, and said the U.S. and other countries did not need Beijing's permission to offer the Uyghurs asylum. The obligation to ensure that individuals at risk of persecution or torture are not refouled is not up for negotiation with the persecutor country, the State Department said,...",

Months after the route closed, Mike struck up the idea while speaking to his wife and a landowner in the pub. Mike, who lives locally, then rented part of the field from farmer John Dinham and invested in Tarmac and loose gravel to build his 400m road. The toll was even affordable with cars charged just £2 to use the shortcut while motorbikes got access for just £1. Shortly after the new road opened, Mike told the BBC : \"As we expected, people are just enjoying the fact they can go about their daily business without the 14-mile detour that they've been having to suffer. \"If you've got a 14-mile detour you're going to spend far more than that in time and in fuel costs. It's been very well received.\" The route welcomed its 100,000th vehicle in October 2014 but the road would close just weeks later. When the route opened, Bath and North East Somerset Council confirmed a planning application had not been received. The council bosses asked for \"operating plans and health and safety conditions” with a proper plan sent in around September 2014, costing Mike around...",

His previous marriages were to musician Nikki Williams (2011–2012), Danielle Cage (2013–2016), with whom he shares two sons, and Hila Cage Coppola (2018–2024), with whom he welcomed twin daughters.

In July 2024, he was arrested on a felony assault charge following an incident involving Fulton, who later sued Cage, alleging he ignored Weston's mental health issues.

        "content": "The Devendra Fadnavis government in Maharashtra has faced a series of challenges since coming to power last November. In the latest, Maharashtra minister Dhananjay Munde has resigned after his close aide was arrested for the torture and killing of a village Sarpanch in Beed. The Sarpanch, Santosh Deshmukh, was kidnapped, tortured for hours and dumped on a road on December 9. Investigations reveal that he was beaten with a rod and subjected to unspeakable brutality, which led to his death hours later. Santosh Deshmukh had tried to stop an extortion attempt targeting a windmill energy firm. According to a police chargesheet, the mastermind of the killing was Dhananjay Munde's aide Walmik Karad, who was seen in videos of the incident. The videos provoked a huge backlash for the state's ruling Mahayuti comprising the BJP and its allies Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Dhananjay Munde is a member of Ajit Pawar's party. The decision to ask for his resignation was reportedly taken at a meeting on Monday night (March 3) between Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and his deputy Ajit Pawar. The Chief Minister already has one sulking deputy on his hands: Eknath Shinde. Shinde has lately been tossing out warnings: “ Mujhko halke me mat lena (Don't take me lightly)”. His threats have generated huge interest, speculation and theories in Maharashtra's political corridors. In an attempt to extinguish the speculation, Fadnavis presented a united...",

He was taking part in a live fire training exercise on the Brecon Beacons when he heard a gun fire close by. His friend screamed and Stuart thought somebody else had been injured. Rifleman Anderson rushed to give his comrade first aid but quickly realised that he could not move his left leg, which now felt warm. That was the moment when he realised that he had been shot in the foot. This report contains images of severe injury \"There was no way of getting me down from the mountains and I was left there for hours without pain relief,\" he said. \"They got me to hospital in Abergavenny and a surgeon told me that I'd probably have to have my foot amputated. \"I did what every hardened rifleman did, which was cry and ask for my mum,\" he said with a smile. A specialist surgeon managed to save his foot and all five toes over four separate operations, but the injury was too complex to ever fully recover from. His gunshot wound was caused by a fault in the assault rifle, which the British Army used at the time. Another solider's SA80 had overheated in training and fired by mistake, an error which is known as \"cooking off\". Despite \"having to learn to walk again,\" the 48-year-old, went on to serve in various campaigns, including Northern Ireland, Bosnia and Kosovo.

Until recently, however, she had always been resistant to the idea.“It is a trust when you do something like this,” she tells RadioTimes.com in an exclusive interview ahead of the release of a new documentary, simply titled Twiggy.“I had been approached many times over the last 20 years or so about doing my life story, and for whatever reason it didn’t work out or it wasn’t something that I felt comfortable with. It’s quite a big thing to put into somebody’s hands.”The circumstances which eventually led to the new film were rather fortuitous. Actress and fashion designer Sadie Frost had been a guest on Twiggy’s podcast Tea with Twiggy to promote her first documentary – about the iconic ’60s fashion designer Mary Quant – and during the episode Twiggy asked her if she had plans for any more features.Frost’s response was that she had especially enjoyed doing extensive research into the fashion and cultural scene of the ’60s, and would like to find somebody else to cover from that period. And then it struck her: Twiggy herself would be the perfect subject. So, the following week the pair met up for lunch and it quickly became clear that it was going to be a fruitful collaboration.“I loved the idea, number one, that she’s a woman, and could understand a lot of what I went through,” Twiggy...",

It’s also helpful to have access to a bench.However, I was able to do the workout with just one set of dumbbells and no bench, so while it’s not ideal, you can get a great session done without needing too much kit if it’s easier for you.Watch TIFF x DAN’s 25-minute full-body workoutAfter a quick warm up the main workout is broken down into five rounds, with each targeting a different area of the body.

The film, the government judged, was simply too “horrifying” for the public. Two decades after that, The War Game finally aired, prior to the release of the 1984 film Threads, which, in imagining the aftermath of a nuclear attack on the UK, was the first movie to deal with the scientific reality of nuclear winter. When I was 11, I had nightmares for a few weeks after seeing a trailer for a nuclear doomsday film ( The Sum of All Fears ) that ran prior to a cinema screening of The Fellowship of the Ring (I had just read the three Lord of the Rings volumes). The Nazgûl were disturbing, of course, but they were not of the real world, unlike nukes. This January, I was confronted with The War Game at an exhibition on The Atomic Age at Paris’s Museum of Modern Art; I finished the exhibit in near silence. A week later, I watched Threads; it ruined the remainder of my afternoon. Both films are the bleakest things I have ever seen – enough to induce nightmares in any adult. It is fitting that words fall short of the power of their imagery in revealing the pointless atrocity that would end healthcare, agriculture and even language itself for the mentally ruined, deformed, illiterate generations that would linger on, subsisting through a collective non-life.

Here you will find the largest contiguous bulb area in the country. April is the best time to cycle among the millions of colourful crocuses, daffodils, hyacinths and tulips. Between Schagen, Den Helder, Den Oever and Middenmeer you will find flower fields as far as the eye can see. I’d highly recommend the dune road from Callantsoog to Den Helder.

In the final year of his illustrious professional career, Cena turned heel. Moreover, The Cenation Leader broke a Guinness World Record in the process. According to the publication, Cena now holds the record for the longest babyface run before turning heel. The last time fans saw the WWE legend in a dark persona was in 2003. As such, the Elimination Chamber ending marked the end of a 21-year run as the ultimate babyface of WWE for Cena. The Franchise Player also holds the world record for granting the most Make-A-Wishes. After turning face two decades ago, Cena prospered as the poster boy of the Stamford-based promotion. Despite facing a polarizing fanbase, Cena stuck to being the good guy. However, the former United States Champion admitted to coming close to turning heel during his feud with The Rock. Since reverting to part-time status, Cena slowly but eventually won the majority of the crowd support. Last year, the Peacemaker star announced that 2025 would be his final year as a WWE Superstar. As such, what transpired at Elimination Chamber came as a shocker, not only to the wrestling industry but also to the entire world. From Shannon Sharpe berating Cena to Jon Stewart using the betrayal to explain geopolitics , that moment has sent the outside world into a frenzy.

The aim is to educate and empower female athletes, and address the gender gap that exists in sports science research, something three-times Paralympic champion Wiggs believes has held women back. \"When I stared my career everything that was being prescribed to us as female athletes was based off male research,\" says the 44-year-old. \"This alliance will be transformational. It'll be a real turning point for female athletes across the globe to have a trusted, relevant resource to go to that isn't just something you see on social media.\" The initiative has been driven by Dr Richard Burden, female health and performance lead at the UK Sports Institute. \"We just don't understand enough about many of the challenges that female athletes face,\" he said. \"For example 'how does the menstrual cycle influence performance?'

We've been told from a young age to brush our teeth twice a day, and any dentist will have hammered home the importance of regular flossing and using mouthwash to really keep your mouth healthy. But apparently, even if you follow the right steps and brush and floss twice a day, you could still be doing things wrong. To mark National Dentists Day today (March 6), one dental hygienist has claimed that many of us follow the correct steps but in the wrong order - and it means our teeth aren't as clean as they could be. Krysta Ambruson went viral on TikTok for sharing the \"correct order\" for taking care of your teeth and gums - which not only involved doing things in a different order than we're used to, but even included steps many of us don't do at all. The expert shared her advice in a video specifically talking about what your nighttime routine would look like, but she later explained that the morning routine should be pretty similar. While most of us would brush our teeth for two minutes, then floss afterwards and finish off with mouthwash, that isn't the correct order. In fact, we shouldn't even think about picking up the toothbrush until much later. The dental hygienist says that oil pulling should be your first step if you practice it. Oil pulling is the practice of swishing an edible oil around the mouth for between five and 20 minutes. It's believed...",

Jones, 31, who won gold at London 2012 and Rio 2016, will be trained by former British and Commonwealth champion Stephen Smith in Liverpool. Jones said: “Taekwondo has given me everything – an incredible journey, unforgettable memories and the honour of representing my country on the biggest stage. “I’ve given everything to taekwondo and I’m now ready for a new challenge. Boxing has always fascinated me and I’m excited to test myself in a completely different arena. “I know it won’t be easy and, if I’m being honest, I don’t really know what to expect, but I thrive on pushing myself beyond my limits and am excited by journey ahead.” Jones was only 19 years old when she won gold in the -57kg category in London and repeated the feat four years later before going on to clinch an elusive first world title in Manchester in 2019. Jones’ build-up to her fourth Games in Paris last year was overshadowed by controversy over a missed drugs test in December, for which she ultimately avoided a ban after UK Anti-Doping found she had committed a no-fault violation on confidential medical grounds. Jones’ boxing debut will be announced in due course and Smith, part of a family dynasty that includes championship-winning brothers Liam, Callum and Paul, believes she has what it takes to transition to her new discipline. “Jade is a born fighter –...",

With the days getting longer, it’s time to think about getting that floor clean – and a steam mop could be exactly what you need to do it. Steam mops are a great choice for hard floors. Whether you’re cleaning stone or tiles, the heat from a steam mop will shift dirt and sanitise in ways that a regular mop can only dream of. The Shark Klik n Flip Steam Mop is now £99 at Lakeland, saving you £40 . The Shark Klik n Flip Smartronic Steam Pocket Mop (to use its full name) has a water reservoir in the handle, with three steam settings to deal with all levels of dirt. It comes with two machine-washable cleaning pads and thanks to the design, these are easy to change without getting your hands dirty - a slightly clunkier option compared to the likes of the Dyson WashG1 but that'll set you back £599. When you get to a really stubborn area of dirt, you can flip the mop head out of the way and give it a blast with steam to loosen everything up, before getting the mop to go over and clean up. Steam mops are better than regular mops, because the heat from the steam is much more powerful for cleaning. That makes it easier to remove dirt, while the heat also kills bacteria. That can also help clean grout lines in your floor too, so any tiled area looks better.

Eight points from safety with 11 games of the season remaining – it is not a predicament many teams get out of and as such, many supporters seem resigned to the fact they will be relegated. They sit on 27 points, meaning they would need to almost double their tally in the final run-in to reach the 50-point margin that is often said to guarantee safety – and even as recently as last season, that wasn’t enough given Blyth Spartans failed to beat the drop having reached 50 points. Countless opportunities to get themselves out of where they are have come and gone, but it appears another window – perhaps the final one – is about to open up. March was always going to be a “make-or-break” month for Town’s bid to pull off the greatest of escapes, both in terms of the fixtures within it and the fact that by the end of it, there will be no real time left to pull off sustained moves. It started off in encouraging fashion as they produced a late fightback to rescue a point at Alfreton Town on Saturday – they are at the stage now where draws don’t do them much good but having found themselves 2-0 down with 10 minutes to go, it is one they will still be delighted to take. Now, as manager Paul Carden said after the game, building on it is crucial as they enter a run of fixtures many would describe as presentable.

The 'Be My Baby' songstress, now 75, is a British icon and was a prominent teenage model during the swinging '60s in London. But with her real name being Dame Lesley Lawson, how did she come to get the name Twiggy ? It's a question many people often ask on social media sites such as Reddit , and it all dates back to when the star attended a high school for girls. In 1965, at age 15, while working as an assistant in a London hair salon, she met hairdresser Nigel Davies (later known as Justin de Villeneuve), who called her “Twigs” because of her thin frame. Davies then led her physical transformation the following year – giving her a short boyish bob with big darkly lined eyes and false eyelashes. Twiggy’s petite frame was ideal for the rising hemlines and unisex patterns that were in fashion at the time, and her overall look made her stand out her from the curvaceous, glamorous top models of the era. After spotting her photo on a salon wall, a fashion journalist for Daily Express interviewed her and published an article featuring her. They christened Twiggy as the “The Face of ’66,” and she was later voted British Woman of the Year. After this, Twiggy's modelling career took off as she quickly gaining international recognition. Her appearance on the cover of the US edition of the leading fashion magazine Vogue (April 1967)...",

Speaking about the show, he said: \"We could have made a drama about gangs and knife crime, or about a kid whose mother is an alcoholic, or whose father is a violent abuser. \"Instead, we wanted you to look at this family and think, 'My God. This could be happening to us!' And what's happening here is an ordinary family's worst nightmare.\" The series is helmed by Philip Barantini, who previously collaborated with Stephen on the award-winning short film and TV show, Boiling Point. The unique continuous filming style - the one shot - was maintained for this series too, requiring the actors to undergo weeks of rehearsals with Philip to ensure flawless performances on the day of shooting. Stephen Graham is a 51 year old British actor hailing from Lancashire, known for his roles in Snatch and Gangs of New York.

Durga Prasad Karanam, a researcher at Ahmedabad’s Physical Research Laboratory, shared insights with PTI. He stated that understanding these ice particles could reveal crucial details about their history and evolution. The study was published in Communications Earth and Environment. The Chandrayaan-3 mission, launched by ISRO from Bengaluru, achieved a historic soft landing near the Moon’s south pole on 23 August 2023. The landing site was later named Shiv Shakti Point on 26 August. Located at about 69 degrees south latitude, the site experiences extreme temperature changes. Temperature Variations and NASA Connection At the landing location, which sits on a six-degree Sun-facing slope, daytime temperatures reached 82°C, while nighttime temperatures dropped to -170°C. A nearby flat surface, just a metre away, recorded a lower peak of 60°C. These conditions match NASA’s proposed Artemis landing sites, which aim to establish a long-term lunar presence.

        "content": "Ahead of the 2025 season, Toronto Blue Jays star Vladimir Guerrero Jr. spoke about his contract extension negotiations. During this, the 4-time MLB All-Star claimed that his final asking price was “much less” than Juan Soto . Soto shattered sporting records in this offseason as he landed the biggest contract in professional sports. The Dominican international penned down a huge 15-year $765 million deal with the New York Mets after becoming a free agent. While doing so, he passed up the 16-year $760 million offer of the New York Yankees which would have seen him return to the Bronx. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is in the final year of his contract with the Blue Jays. He and the team were recently reported to be in talks about a contract extension. However, things did not materialize and the time to agree an extension was passed. Guerrero Jr. will now become the next big free agent in the next offseason. During an interview with Ernesto Jerez and Enrique Rojas of ESPN, the first baseman revealed that his asking price was below $600 million, which is way less than Soto’s current contract. It’s much less than Soto. We’re talking about many fewer millions than Soto, more than a hundred million less. ... It was the same number of years (as Soto’s contract), but it didn’t reach ($600 million). The last number we gave them as a counteroffer didn’t reach 600. The 26-year-old later added that he knows the business. He claimed that he was looking for a contract near 14 years. He would have...",

The same was witnessed during the Women's Premier League (WPL) encounter between Mumbai Indians and UP Warriorz at the Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow on Thursday. Harmanpreet, who is the skipper of Mumbai Indians, got into a heated argument with Warriorz' all-rounder Sophie Ecclestone, forcing umpires to intervene the scene. The incident took place right before the final over of the Warriorz innings as due to slow over-rate umpire Ajitesh Argal informed Harmanpreet that she could only field three players outside the circle. Harmanpreet tried to protest the call and was soon joined by teammate Amelia Kerr also expressing her displeasure. This led to Ecclestone walk up to the umpires to present her case, however, it didn't sit well with Harmanpreet.

This ruling comes in the wake of a legal challenge by Dubai-based Seclink Technologies Corp, which challenged the Maharashtra government's decision to award the project, touted as Asia's largest urban rehabilitation initiative, to an Adani Group firm.The Supreme Court issued notices to key parties involved, including successful bidder Adani Properties, the Maharashtra government, and Dubai-based Seclink Technologies Corp, which is challenging the award.Seclink Technologies had initially challenged the Maharashtra government's decision in the Bombay High Court, claiming that its bid was superior to that of the Adani Group. The Bombay High Court in December 2024 dismissed Seclink's plea, stating that the grounds presented lacked merit and emphasizing the authority of the government in determining the appropriate bids for such projects. In the latest, the bench led by CJI Sanjiv Khanna asked Seclink to undertake that its bid of Rs 8,640 crore is substantially higher than Adani's bid of Rs 5,069 crore. However, the court clarified that Seclink must adhere to all obligations previously agreed upon by Adani, which includes a Rs 1,000 crore lease payment to the Railways and a Rs 2,800 crore indemnity payment, as well as the construction of 812 railway quarters.The top court asked the...",

The Johnnies won the regular-season conference championship for the first time in several years. What Pitino has accomplished in just two quick years—from upgrading team facilities to leading his squad to a conference title and potentially a two-seed in the NCAA Tournament—is remarkable. In year two, Pitino has broken more head coaching records. The Johnnies are receiving heavy national attention, especially after sweeping back-to-back national champion UConn this season. Pitino is well-liked in the basketball world, but his coaching philosophy is far from a buddy-buddy approach. On Thursday, Pitino appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. The second-year head coach sat down with Fallon to discuss the regular season up until this point. Fallon also brought up the viral video of Pitino ripping into his team during halftime. Pitino seemed to enjoy his time just sitting and talking with Fallon. Although the show airs at night, it is filmed in front of a live audience at 5:00 p.m. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the show was the song that Fallon, Pitino, and St. John’s players came up with. The song was a lighthearted rendition of their season so far, along with their aspirations for March. The Red Storm hope to make a run in the March Madness Tournament, and that was evident in the music video. Jimmy, the @StJohnsBBall team & Coach @RealPitino sing a sea shanty...",

This evolution isn’t just about adding AI-powered buttons like “Expand,” “Rewrite,” or “Convert to Bullets.” Instead, it’s about reimagining CMS platforms as Agentic CMS —intelligent systems that don’t just store content but actively think, assist, and collaborate in the creative process. Imagine a CMS that allows creators to publish low-fidelity content—whether through writing, voice input, or even rough ideas—and then handles the intermediate steps. The CMS would refine the content, structure it, and ensure its coherence before publication. This shift represents a fundamental rethinking of how content is produced and managed. The media business is a complex machine, with interdependent processes—ideation, research, production, editing, packaging, and distribution—all working together. Traditionally, scaling these operations meant hiring more people, increasing overhead in an industry already struggling with thin margins. Today, content creation isn’t just for media organizations. Brands, businesses, and even individuals now function as media entities, requiring efficient content workflows to engage audiences effectively. Agentic AI presents a transformative opportunity : rather than relying on large editorial teams, an Agentic CMS can become an active participant in content creation—guiding, assisting, and even automating aspects of the workflow...",

The 2002 and 2013 champions have excelled on pitches offering turn, while the batting group led by Virat Kohli has excelled under pressure with masterful run-chases in victories over Bangladesh, Pakistan and Australia.

The hunger, the commitment and the eagerness to try and do something special for the country is always there.

The money guru has urged holidaymakers to make sure they have travel insurance ‘ASAB’ - as soon as the holiday is booked. During his Martin Lewis Money Show Live on Tuesday, March 4, Martin gave an impassioned plea to those who have booked a trip abroad in 2025. He said: “Most people book their holidays for the summer in January and February, especially most families. The key thing to understand - travel insurance is not just to cover you while you’re away. “It’s also very important to cover you in case something happens before you go that stops you going. \"So I have a rule - you should get your travel insurance ASAB - as soon as you book. “But right now, many people have already booked. \"If you don’t have your travel insurance and your holiday's booked, do it right now.” Martin talked through two scenarios whereby tourists needed help when they found they were unable to go on holiday due to medical issues. But he said without travel insurance, he is \"impotent\" to support those who have to cancel their holidays. He stressed: “Do not get your travel insurance the day before you go.You get your travel insurance ASAB. “Very simply, just think about it for a second.

However, the broader market showed resilience, with the smallcap index outperforming by rising up to 1 percent intraday. Global uncertainties, including concerns over US trade policies and continued foreign fund outflows, kept investors cautious. Market sentiment was impacted by the latest move from US President Donald Trump, who decided to delay imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico until April 2, raising concerns over prolonged trade negotiations. By 12:15 PM, the Sensex was down 67.31 points or 0.09 percent at 74,272.78, while the Nifty declined 11.80 points or 0.05 percent to 22,532.90. Stock Market LIVE Updates Among the laggards were IndusInd Bank , Infosys , NTPC, and Shriram Finance. On the other hand, Bajaj Twins, Axis Bank, Grasim Industries, and Eicher Motors led the gainers list. Market breadth remained positive, with 2,319 stocks advancing, 1,133 declining, and 128 remaining unchanged on the BSE. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, noted that Trump’s stance on tariffs has created uncertainty in global markets. \"His decision to postpone tariffs indicates that he is more inclined toward negotiations than implementing high tariffs permanently. However, markets are wary of the long-term implications,\" he said. The US markets witnessed a sharp sell-off on Thursday as investors...",

The photo dump also included a picture from Mexico City, featuring a wall with an optical illusion art with abstract, geometric patterns.

He also tried to emphasise that the budget was \"development-oriented\". The total expenditure for the 2025-26 budget is estimated to be ₹ 4,09,549 crore. It includes revenue expenditure of ₹ 3,11,739 crore, capital expenditure of ₹ 71,336 crore and loan repayment of ₹ 26,474 crore. The chief minister presented the budget in the Assembly sitting due to knee pain, which he has been suffering for some time now. The government has the responsibility to ensure that available resources are accessible to everyone, by balancing economic development with people's welfare. The administration was shaping Karnataka's development model through the concept of \"Universal Basic Income\", said Siddaramaiah. \"Many of the welfare programmes we offer, including the five guarantees, are not merely freebies; I can confidently say that these are strategic investments made on economic and social principles,\" he said. The chief minister noted that this year's budget will focus on implementing programmes across six key developmental dimensions: Welfare Programmes Budget, Agriculture and Rural Development Budget, Development-Oriented Budget, Prioritizing Urban Development, Investment and Job Creation and Governance Reforms. \"In addition to these initiatives, we will prioritise new...",

The FBR projected that the current high tax rates have significantly reduced transaction volumes in these sectors. By lowering the rates, the tax machinery expects to generate over Rs100 billion in additional revenue between April and June of the ongoing fiscal year. Pakistani authorities have conveyed their proposal to the IMF but remain uncertain whether the tax cuts will be implemented within the current fiscal year or incorporated into the 2025-26 budget. The IMF has assessed that with full-fledged enforcement and recovery, FBR’s tax collection could touch Rs12,480 billion till end of June 30 against fixed target of Rs12,970 billion. The FBR high-ups presented simulation under historical trends of revenue collection made in the last four months over a certain timeframe. They made all-out efforts that with recovery in the stuck-up revenue cases in the courts, the annual tax collection target could be materialised. After hearing the Pakistan side, IMF’s fiscal team incorporated all the available data and details in its model.

        "content": "The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCII) has not announced the list of annual contracts this year and according to a report by Times Of India , Virat Kohli , Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja may end up losing out on their Grade A+ contracts. The report claimed that players who excel in all three formats are given preference for Grade A+ contracts and the trio's retirement from the T20 format has complicated matters. The report added that the central contracts are generally announced before the Indian Premier League (IPL) but the BCCI have decided to wait till the end of the Champions Trophy. However, a good show in the Champions Trophy can mean that all three can retain the top tier of the central contracts. The only other cricketer with a Grade A+ contract is fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah but there seems to be no problems with his situation. According to the report, Shreyas Iyer is expected to be awarded a central contract after he was ignored last year due to disciplinary issues. The batter has performed brilliantly in the Champions Trophy and his showing on the domestic circuit will certainly bolster his case. “The board will wait for Rohit's decision after the Champions Trophy. If by any chance he chooses to retire, then the board will see what needs to be done. One can't discount the fact that he won the T20 World Cup in July and has led well in the Champions Trophy as well,” a source told TOI. Meanwhile, ormer South African cricketer AB de Villiers hailed star...",

The 31-year-old won taekwondo gold at London 2012 and Rio 2016 and was World Champion in 2019 as well as being a three-time European champion. Jones has been boxing for two months and is training with former professional boxer Stephen Smith. She is \"dreaming big\" as she aims to become a two sport world champion. Jones is not the first, and unlikely to be the last, to switch sports in the pursuit of further success. BBC Sport looks at those who have made sporting switches – with varying levels of success. Eight-time Olympic champion Usain Bolt is regarded as the greatest sprinter of all time and still holds the world record for the 100m and 200m. The Jamaican ended his glittering track and field career in 2017 and turned his attention to forging a new sporting career – as a footballer. Bolt trained with Borussia Dortmund, South African club Mamelodi Sundowns and Norway's Stromsgodset before joining Australian club Central Coast Mariners for an \"indefinite training period\" in August 2018 but left after eight weeks. A professional career never materialised and Bolt has had to settle for appearances at charity fixture Soccer Aid. Rees-Zammit shocked rugby union in January 2024, when he announced before the Six Nations he was quitting the sport in a bid to make a breakthrough in American football.

The officer aged between 35 and 40 years, succumbed to his injuries at the scene. Law enforcement officials arrived at the scene after receiving reports of the incident and initiated an investigation. Police confirmed the death and said no foul play was suspected. Authorities are currently probing the circumstances leading to the incident. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), in a statement said, “An officer of the Ministry of External Affairs passed away in the morning of March 07, 2025, in New Delhi. The Ministry is providing all possible assistance to the family and is in touch with the Delhi Police.” \"The Ministry stands with the family in this hour of grief and difficulty. Further details are not being released bearing in mind the need to respect the family’s privacy in this time of bereavement,\" MEA added. Chanakyapuri, known as the diplomatic enclave of Delhi, houses various embassies and government offices. Further details regarding the officer’s professional background and any potential reasons behind his actions are yet to be ascertained. Discussing suicides can be triggering for some.

The fake news of his death spread quickly because he shared his first name with Shashi Prabhu. Speaking to the news agency IANS, Shashi Sinha confirmed, “I have been receiving numerous condolence messages and calls on my phone since the false news of my death circulated. Since I share the same name as Govinda's old friend and former secretary Shashi Prabhu, the confusion led to this false news. Shashi Prabhu was his secretary at the time of Ilzaam, after that, I have been looking after this work.” Shashi Sinha, in a conversation with ETimes , shed light on Govinda's equation with his former secretary and “childhood friend”.

Trump, speaking from the Oval Office, said, “We have two astronauts that are stuck in space. I have asked Elon (Musk), I said, ‘Do me a favour. Can you get them out?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ He is preparing to go up, I think in two weeks.” He went on to remark about Williams’ appearance, saying, “And I see the woman with the wild hair, good, solid head of hair she’s got. There’s no kidding, there’s no games with her hair.” The two astronauts, who embarked on what was initially an eight-day mission in June 2024, have remained aboard the ISS for nine months due to technical failures in Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft, including helium leaks and thruster malfunctions. Blaming Biden for the delay, Trump asserted, “Biden left them up there... He allowed that to happen to you, but this president won’t let it happen. We’re going to get them out. We’re coming up to get you.” He also suggested the situation was dangerous, saying, “It can have some failures up there. That would be very bad.

The expansion was driven by borrower additions of over 0.15 Mn onboarded in January and February 2025. While most geographies exhibited stable growth, Karnataka saw relatively muted expansion due to regulatory uncertainties, impacting loan disbursements and collections in the region. Despite short-term pressures, asset quality showed signs of stability across most operating geographies, except for Karnataka, which experienced a sharp increase in delinquencies. The company's Portfolio at Risk (PAR 0+) rose to 7.5% in February 2025 from 6.8% in December 2024, largely due to stress in Karnataka, where PAR 0+ surged from 4.3% to 7.9%. Other states like Tamil Nadu witnessed a marginal deterioration in asset quality, with PAR 0+ rising from 8.9% to 9.3%, primarily due to the lagged impact of heavy rains and cyclones in late 2024. Outlook This revision accounts for faster-than-expected asset quality stabilization, sustainable loan portfolio expansion, and the recent stock price uptrend.

In October 2024, when director-producer Karan Johar’s Dharma Productions was gearing up nervously for the release of its Hindi-language film Jigra [Courage] in theatres, few knew that the 45-year-old production house, which has made some of India’s most loved films, had been struggling to survive. Since 2019, most of Dharma’s films had not done well, and only one of the four films they released in theatres in 2024 had recovered some money. Dharma’s net profits had plummeted, from $1.2m in fiscal year 2023 to $68,135 a year later. Its managers and directors had reportedly not been paid for months. And Johar, 52, who had inherited the production house after his father’s death in 2004, was in talks to sell 50 percent stake. Jigra, a thriller set in Thailand, had been made at a cost of 800 million rupees ($9.2m) and starred Alia Bhatt, one of Bollywood’s leading actresses who had also come on board as a co-producer. There were murmurs within Dharma and the film trade that the movie wasn’t likely to be a commercial success. Dharma did its best to maintain the illusion that Jigra was going to be a hit. A few weeks before its release, it put out the film’s poster and trailer. On its social media handles it claimed that the trailer got more than 40 million views in 24 hours and shared fans’ excited reactions: “Goosebumps all over,” said one. “Absolute banger,”...",

With the new league year set to begin on March 12, teams are working to position themselves within the constraints of the NFL salary cap. Right now, the Atlanta Falcons are among the teams needing to clear space, sitting $5.2 million over the cap . On Thursday, Atlanta started making moves by declining to tender linebacker Nate Landman and cornerback Dee Alford. That’s likely just the beginning, as more players from last season’s roster are expected to hit free agency. Nonetheless, the Falcons will also be looking to the market for key acquisitions. And on Thursday, a major name became available. To clear $25.3 million in cap space, the Los Angeles Chargers released Joey Bosa after nine seasons. CBS Sports' John Breech believes the Falcons should strongly consider making a move . \"This is a team that definitely needs to add some pass-rushing help. They had just 31 sacks last season, which was the second fewest in the NFL. Matthew Judon had 5.5 of those sacks, but he might not be returning to Atlanta since he's set to be a free agent. The Falcons don't really have any salary cap space, which could be the biggest obstacle when it comes to signing Bosa.\" Atlanta will have to address its cap situation before making any major moves, whether through contract restructures or additional cuts. As for Judon, the Falcons may have received a positive sign about his potential return. The veteran pass rusher recently posted a...",

Speaking at the Moneycontrol Global Wealth Summit 2025 in Mumbai on March 7, the banker said as India is poised for significant growth in the coming years, it is important to make such benefits available to the middle class. \"Wealth management is normally afforded by people with balances of about Rs 20- 50 lakh because it is largely supported by humans. How do we expand this market for normal people is going to be a very key issue to address in the times to come,\" Vaidyanathan said. Wealth management and multiplying wealth is great for people who have the wealth but people “who are just off the radar and have earnings, say for example, between Rs 1 to 2 lakh a month and who save Rs 20,000-30,000 a month, that is wealth in their life\", he said.

        "content": "NEW YORK -- As their party struggles to navigate the early days of Donald Trump's second presidency, some Democrats are convinced that their road to recovery lies in the price of eggs. Instead of leaning into Trump's teardown of the federal government or his alliance with billionaire lieutenant Elon Musk , they're steering to what they perceive as the everyday concerns of Americans — none more important than grocery prices and eggs in particular. U.S. egg prices hit a record average of $4.95 per dozen in January, surpassing a previous record set in January 2023, according to federal data. In some parts of the country, they’re much higher. A Safeway supermarket in San Francisco was selling a dozen eggs for $10.99 this week. The U.S. Department of Agriculture expects egg prices to rise 41% this year. Already, some restaurants are adding temporary surcharges when customers order eggs. Denny’s said its surcharge varies by region and even by restaurant, while Waffle House added a 50-cent surcharge per egg at all its restaurants. The Democratic establishment’s focus on blaming Trump for those price spikes represents a stark break from its activists, who have launched a protest movement arguing that Trump is a budding dictator with no regard for the Constitution. Such concerns may be valid, some Democratic members of Congress say, but they don't resonate with working-class Americans trying to feed their families. “When that is your day-to-day worry, the philosophical conversations...",

The Bengaluru-headquartered company will be implementing a new attendance system that requires the employees to work from the office for the designated number of days each month. In an email, the functional heads at the second-largest software service company in India, informed their teammates to limit the work-from-home days, according to a report in The Economic Times . The new 'system intervention' process will prioritise project needs over departmental requests, implying that work-from-home requests will no longer be automatically approved. Currently, Infosys employees use a mobile app to punch attendance which accepts WFH requests by default. Instead, employees will be required to mark their physical presence on all 10 days at designated office locations. The directive applies to employees at job level 5 (JL5) and below. Team leaders are at JL5 while those below include the likes of software engineers, senior engineers, system engineers and consultants. Meanwhile, JL6 includes managers, senior managers and senior delivery managers. \"To support this, starting March 10, 2025, system interventions will be implemented to limit the number of work-from-home days that can be applied each month.

        "content": "TSMC’s chief executive, CC Wei, smiled broadly as he stood next to Donald Trump in the White House on Monday, announcing what he said was the biggest foreign direct investment on US soil in history. His company – the producer of most of the world’s most advanced semiconductors – would boost its existing $65bn US presence by a whopping $100bn . For TSMC the deal meant they would avoid massive tariffs Trump had flagged for the global chip industry. For the US it mean tens of thousands of construction jobs, and the eventual development of crucial technology on US soil, far away from the threat of China taking control of it if it one day annexed Taiwan . The deal is not set in stone. Under Taiwanese law TSMC is required to have government approval for any foreign investment over $1.5bn – a fraction of this deal’s size. President Lai Ching-te said the government would review the deal with “national interests” in mind. The economic affairs ministry told the Guardian on Wednesday it hadn’t received an application yet. But the deal has rung alarm bells. Members of the opposition KMT have said it could weaken Taiwan’s security. “The more TSMC produces in the US, the lower Taiwan’s geopolitical importance will be, and the less incentive the US will have to help Taiwan in the future,” said the KMT legislator Ko Ju-Chun. Taiwan’s chip industry – of which TSMC is the largest and most advanced member – contributes up to 15% of Taiwan’s GDP. It is also seen by many as Taiwan’s “silicon...",

A heartwarming post highlighting the generosity of a shop manager towards a beggar is currently going viral on the Bengaluru subreddit. A user named Latter Preference 228 took to the popular subreddit and shared a beautiful anecdote of how he witnessed shop managers be kind to an impoverished individual. . The 21-year-old, who had only spent two days in Bengaluru, expressed admiration for the city’s atmosphere, highlighting a particular moment that left a lasting impact.According to his account, he had visited a well-known coffee shop, Cothas Coffee, and was enjoying his drink when an unexpected event caught his attention. A homeless woman approached the café, and he initially assumed that the staff would ask her to leave, as is often the case in many public places. However, what unfolded next took him by surprise.Rather than dismissing her or asking her to move away, the café employees welcomed her with warmth and generosity. Instead of treating her with indifference, they extended an act of kindness—offering her a cup of coffee with genuine compassion. The user described this moment as a rare sight, something he had not often witnessed in his home country.While the gesture may have seemed small to some, for him, it carried a profound significance. He expressed how this simple act of humanity reignited his faith in the people of India. The incident, in his view, symbolized a shift toward empathy and unity,...",

Dr Irfan, Emergency in-charge at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, revealed that over 70 cases of cholera and acidity are being recorded daily at the hospital. He further said that under normal circumstances, around 30 cases of cholera and acidity are reported daily at Jinnah Hospital. Similarly, Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Emergency In-charge Dr Imran said that 60 to 70 cases of cholera and other stomach diseases were being reported daily at the hospital. A significant number of these patients also suffer from high blood pressure, he added. Medical experts have advised people to include yogurt in their meals during Suhoor and Iftar while reducing tea consumption. They also recommend walking after Suhoor and Iftar and avoiding immediate sleep after meals. To maintain good health, experts suggest moderate eating habits and replacing spicy and fried foods with porridge, fruits, and salads. Additionally, people should prioritise drinking water, lemon water, and fresh juices. Meanwhile, Karachi is experiencing a severe shortage of blood donations during Ramadan, haematologist Dr Saqib Ansari said. He said that patients suffering from thalassemia, haemophilia, anaemia, blood cancer, and other disorders are facing difficulties due to the lack of blood donations. Dr Saqib said that more than 150,000 blood bags are required...",

The incident occurred on Wide Bay Highway near Gympie, Queensland , and an image from first responders showed the caravan on its side. While the exact cause of the crash is unknown police reminded motorists \"to ensure your caravan and vehicle are roadworthy and loaded safely\". It's a sentiment echoed by many in the industry and Jeff De Ath, the owner of a caravan weighing company , is no different. Being mindful of the weight distribution between a vehicle and its towed caravan can be the difference between life and death, and many motorists aren't aware they are even overloading their caravans to unsafe levels. \"When you put weight on the back, you change the tow ball weight [in between the vehicle and car], and you lower it to a weight that's too low at a certain speed to be safe,\" he previously told Yahoo News . He explained there are nationwide standards for maximum weights of different points in a vehicle, and it's imperative caravanners are clued up about them. What to keep in mind: Footage of swaying caravan shocks Aussies Shocking footage of what can go wrong when towing a caravan was posted online recently by a truckie who was driving his 57-tonne vehicle behind the caravan. His dashcam picked up the caravan swaying from side to side on the road and even moving into...",

But even when she’s not winning hearts with her films, the actor manages to remain in the spotlight with her aura! Just yesterday, we showed our readers a video of Kat from her filmmaker friend Karishma Kohli’s pre-wedding festivity, which was doing the rounds of the internet. In this viral clip, the actor channelled her inner Kitto Bahu as she danced to Aditi Rao Hydari and Abhishek Bachchan’s song Sasural Genda Phool from the 2009 film Delhi-6 . Today, we have got our hands on another unseen gem featuring Katrina! A post shared by HT City (@htcity) This time, Katrina Kaif paid tribute to one of her most beloved characters of all time— the free-spirited Laila from Zoya Akhtar’s 2011 masterpiece Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara . The actor once again filled our hearts and minds with Laila’s positivity as she danced to the retro-pop track Sooraj Ki Baahon Mein from ZNMD . For this cute dance performance at Karishma Kohli’s mehendi ceremony, Katrina was joined by her fellow bridesmaid Sairah, daughter of her good friend Mini Mathur and filmmaker Kabir Khan. While Katrina looked stunning as ever in her periwinkle blue corset lehenga, Sairah was pretty in a pink lehenga with gold embroidery, paired with a gold blouse. A post shared by ~inara~ (@heylo_.editt) Soon after this video surfaced on social media, many fans showered love on Katrina, glad to see her burn the dance floor again. For instance,...",

These fish have never before been seen alive in daylight, as they normally dwell in the “twilight zone” at depths from 200m to 600m.The video has provoked an enormously empathetic response on social media, with some seeing the fish as a feminist icon or an Icarus-like figure who swam too close to the Sun. The reaction shows our views of the deep sea – long ignored or seen as a realm of monsters – may at last be changing.The Strange Lives Of AnglerfishAnglerfish are much smaller than you probably think they are. The specimen Boguñá filmed was a female, which typically grow up to 15cm long.The creatures are named for their bioluminescent lure (or esca). This modified dorsal fin ray can produce a glow used to fish (or angle) for prey in the dim depths of the sea. The bioluminescence is produced by symbiotic bacteria that live inside the bulbous head of the esca.Male anglerfish lack the iconic lure and are much smaller, usually reaching a length of only 3cm.A male anglerfish spends the first part of his life searching for a female to whom he will then attach himself.

        "content": "T he PrettyLittleThing unicorn has had a makeover. Or should that be makeunder? The mascot of the notorious fast fashion label was once resplendent in pink, soaring onto the brand’s packaging powered by cartoonish wings. Its very presence conjured up images of bodycon dresses covered in cut-outs, of brand deals with Love Island stars, of an entire website section devoted to the concept of “jeans and a nice top”. But now, the unicorn’s wings have disappeared. It has been stripped back to a line drawing. And it certainly isn’t pink any longer. Instead, it’s embossed on a beige backdrop. This toned-down emblem is just part of PrettyLittleThing’s sweeping rebrand , unveiled to customers earlier this week. Gone is the shouty, all-caps logo. In its place is a swirly calligraphy-style font. The bright pink visuals are gone, replaced by rich burgundies, browns, creams and yes, inevitably, plenty of beige. The clothes, similarly, draw from a drab palette. Waistcoats, bouclé co-ords and ruched, long-sleeved maxi dresses abound. So do buttoned-up, round-necked suit jackets reminiscent of Angela Merkel’s capsule wardrobe for a G20 summit. There’s barely a pattern, or an inexplicable cut-out, to be seen. According to PLT, this shake-up “heralds an elevated new era that celebrates the brand’s heritage while boldly reimagining its future”. PLT’s tactic is clear. The brand once best known as the purveyor of questionably cheap clothes for going “out-out” is trying to jump on the bandwagon...",

        "content": "After a smooth journey so far, the safety at college fests in Delhi University is again under scrutiny due to the recent reports of overcrowding and mismanagement at Sri Venkateswara College. On Wednesday, a huge crowd gathered outside the gates to attend the finale of the college’s annual cultural fest, Nexus’25 where singer Javed Ali was to perform live. Fest or fiasco? Scary visuals started circulating on social media as the crowd tried to enter the gates of the college, situated at South Campus. The Reels show endless queues of students stretching far beyond the college gate, with a sea of bodies pushing and shoving each other, thus creating a stampede-like situation. “This was no festival, but a catastrophe waiting to happen... total mismanagement! Hours before the event, the crowd stretched from the college to the nearby metro station and as we were told the gates, for the performance scheduled at 5pm, would close by 2pm,” says Digvijay Sulekh, a student of Motilal Nehru College. Recounting the horrifying episode, Sulekh adds, “My friend nearly lost consciousness due to overcrowding. She was suffocated and there was no ambulance in the sight. When we asked for help, the college management just shrugged. If they had the registration data, then they sure knew how many students were coming so why didn’t they take measures prior? They could have closed registrations once the capacity was reached! Or if so many were expected to show up then they should’ve had better system...",

She pointed out the growing size and global popularity of song and dance numbers, crediting it to the heavy investment of money, time, and creative thought. \"Today Bollywood songs have a universal appeal and today everyone seems to like them. I think it's a wonderful trend, because our songs are also getting bigger and better,\" she said. Katrina Kaif shells out ultimate fitness goals, says 'I train my mind, my body will follow' When questioned on whether she could compare herself as a dancer to her predecessors Rekha and Madhuri, Katrina opted instead to praise their own consistent and high-quality careers. \"I believe that they are excellent dancers and they've maintained a constant rate of performing for years. I believe that it's challenging to keep pace with the kind of career route which they've designed for themselves,\" she acknowledged.

Sean Combs, 55, still faces a scheduled May 5 trial in Manhattan on federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty and denied all wrongdoing, including in dozens of civil lawsuits by women and men who accused him of sexual assault and other misconduct. Lawyers and representatives for Combs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. While the new indictment added no new charges, it described what prosecutors called the \"forced labor\" that Combs demanded in connection with the racketeering conspiracy. It said Combs and his associates \"maintained control\" over some employees by forcing them to work long hours with little sleep, through the use of or threats to use physical force, financial harm, psychological harm and reputational harm. \"In doing so, Combs, assisted by members and associates of the enterprise, caused these employees to believe they would be harmed--including by losing their jobs--if they did not comply with his demands,\" the indictment said. Such pressure caused one unnamed employee \"to engage in sex acts with Combs,\" the indictment added. In a letter to U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian, who oversees the case, prosecutors...",

Nichole Pratt, 25, from Foster Crescent, Leominster, admitted to causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity and two counts of sexual assault of a child under 13. She also received a sexual harm prevention order. Pratt faced Hereford Crown Court earlier this week (Tuesday 4 March) and will be subject to a five-year licence upon her release. Charged in August 2024, she entered a guilty plea for the offences in September 2024. The vile acts came to light after police were tipped off anonymously about Pratt's abuse of two children, which she had filmed. Upon arrest, authorities seized her phone and a USB stick, uncovering category A videos of Pratt abusing one child and additional footage on her phone of abuse against another child. Initially denying the accusations during her interview under caution, Pratt ultimately confessed guilt at her plea and trial preparation hearing on 16 September 2024, reports the Mirror. Angela Trafford from the Crown Prosecution Service commented on the case: \"This was a truly harrowing and disturbing case. Nichole Pratt systematically abused two vulnerable young children in what can only be described as the most serious form of sexual abuse. \"The children concerned put their trust in Pratt. By her actions she has shown a flagrant disregard for that trust for her own gratification. \"The sentence handed down will...",

The majority of Democratic lawmakers who protested President Donald Trump’s speech to Congress on Tuesday night—whether by raising signs or walking out—were largely people of color. Texas Rep. Al Green led the charge by yelling at Trump that he had “no mandate” to cut Medicaid funding, which got him kicked out of the chamber and eventually censured. For The New Abnormal’s Danielle Moodie and Andy Levy, white people in the Democratic Party need to be better at pushing back against the Trump administration. “It’s a disproportionately high percentage of the time that it is people of color leading the charge and that s--t has to stop,” Levy said. “Obviously, by that I don’t mean people of color need to stop. I mean, white people need to stand up. White people need to stand up and start realizing that first of all, it’s the right thing to do. And second of all, it’s not fair to place this burden on people of color. It just isn’t.” Subscribe to The New Abnormal on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Stitcher, Amazon Music, or Overcast. “Decorum is not gonna save Democrats in this moment,” Moodie added, referencing orders by House Speaker Mike Johnson for protesters to “maintain decorum” during Trump’s speech.

But naturally, most eyes are drawn to the battle of the scrum-halves. In Antoine Dupont, France have a generational talent. A world player of the year in both the 15s and sevens codes, an Olympic gold medallist and a poster boy for his sport, Dupont has gleefully exhausted superlatives in recent years.

        "content": "Divorce rumours surrounding Prince Narula and Yuvika Chaudhary have been circulating on the internet for the past few months. However, the actress has finally addressed the speculations and put them to rest. Yuvika explained that the rumours \"affected\" Prince, but she chose not to respond, as she didn't feel the need to clarify anything. She set the record straight, revealing that she was staying at her mother's house due to ongoing construction work at her own home. In an interview with ETimes, Yuvika shared, \"This (parenthood) is a new journey for both of us. I didn't react to rumours back then. Prince is very emotional and the rumours affected him, but sometimes I feel there is no need to clarify things. At one point, when I said Prince was busy, I meant he was busy with work. Then people started saying that I was living at my mother's house, but that was because there was construction work going on in my house. I didn't feel the need to explain things to people.\" Speaking further about her relationship with Prince, Yuvika explained that every phase of their journey has been different - from being friends to dating, getting married, and now becoming parents. She mentioned that they've had both fun and tough times, adding that their journey together has only made their bond stronger. Rumours about trouble in their marriage began circulating after netizens noticed Yuvika's absence during Prince's birthday celebration in November. Prince Narula celebrated his 34th birthday...",

        "content": "Naomi Ackie returns to the silver screen in a new thrilling narrative by Oscar-winning director Bong Joon-ho. In Mickey 17, she stars alongside Robert Pattinson, who plays the lead role of Mickey Barnes. The film centres around Mickey, a dispensable worker on a colonial mission to an icy planet named Niflheim. His job on the colony ship involves undertaking perilous tasks, only to be cloned each time he perishes. Ackie takes on the role of security agent Nasha Barridge, who initiates a romance with the first version of Mickey and remains loyal through his multiple lives. While many cinema-goers may recognise her from Zoe Kravitz's 2024 thriller Blink Twice, Ackie has enjoyed a diverse career since 2015. Born and bred in London, the 32-year-old actress graduated from the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in 2014. She secured her first professional TV role on Doctor Who in 2015 and appeared in her debut film Lady Macbeth a year later. The 2016 period drama saw Ackie, then just 24, starring alongside renowned actors such as Florence Pugh and Cosmo Jarvis. In 2019, the Londoner achieved her breakthrough role in Netflix 's The End of the F****** World, which won her a BAFTA for Supporting Actress. After her major success, Ackie played Jannah in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. She subsequently stepped into the role of Whitney Houston in the late superstar's 2022 biopic, I Wanna Dance With Somebody. Fans of the star will be thrilled to hear that Ackie is not hitting the...",

        "content": "China's foreign minister Wang Yi has spoken out against US tariffs and accused it of \"meeting good with evil\". Speaking during a rare press conference in Beijing as part of the week long National People's Congress, Wang said that in the current geopolitical environment China wants to prevent a return to the \"law of the jungle\". He also addressed the status of the self-governed island of Taiwan and reiterated China's position that it is an \"inalienable part of China\" and any attempt to make it independent is \"doomed to fail\". What is still unclear is how US President Donald Trump will deal with the issue of Taiwan. Trump's tilt towards Russia and away from Ukraine has raised questions about the US' commitment to Taiwan in the event of a conflict. China insists that \"reunification\" with Taiwan is inevitable and says it will happen by force if necessary. Taiwan's government wants to maintain the status quo. Officially, the US acknowledges China's position while supplying the island with weapons to defend itself in the event of an attack.
