        "content": "Members of American Legion Post 38 place a wreath near the flag pole at the Mill Springs National Cemetery. The placement of the wreath was part of Monday's Memorial Day services. The dedication of those who have served our country and who have since passed away – in wartime and in times of peace – was honored Monday in a gathering at Mill Springs National Cemetery in Nancy. Those who wanted to pay tribute the men and women who served in the U.S. Military joined American Legion Post 38, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the members of the National Parks Service who oversee the Mill Springs Battlefield and Visitors Center in remembering all those who have gone before us. The ceremony was conducted as part of Memorial Day activities being held at both the National Cemetery and the Civil War-era battlefield. “Hundreds of thousands of Americans have died in preserving liberty and peace for our nation,” said main speaker Allen Boone, retired lieutenant colonel of the U.S. Army. LTC Ret. Allen Boone speaks to the crowd during Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony at Mill Springs. “The Civil War alone had over 700,000 men and women who died in service. Their sacrifices are etched in history, a solemn testament to their bravery and dedication. These men and women understood the meaning of putting others before self. They were dedicated to fulfill their mission at all costs. And as we ponder their sacrifices, our hearts should be filled with gratitude for their willingness to serve against foreign and domestic enemies who sought to destroy our nation,” Boone said. Boone himself has served in active duty, having been in two tours of duty in Iraq. Boone, who currently lives in Lexington, has a masters degree in Management and Leadership from Liberty University and is a graduate of Command and General Staff College. “This day is not just about a day of remembering,” Boone said. “It is time for us to act. As we honor their memory, we pledge that their lives, that their sacrifices, that their valor shall never be forgotten. Let us also pledge to do the utmost and carry out what must, and what they wished for us, in that no other generation of young men and women would have to share their experiences and repeat their sacrifice.” Clarence Floyd, American Legion Post 38 Chaplain, leads the crowd in prayer during Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony at Mill Springs National Cemetery. As part of Monday’s ceremony, American Legion Post 38 Chaplain Clarence Floyd led the crowd in a prayer, in which he said, “As we look across, and as we see all these white markers, Lord, we know that was one of our brothers or sisters, but Lord, they also had a family, and we pray for every one of them and for the life that they lived and for the influence they had on other people.” The ceremony proved bittersweet for Floyd, as he announced he would be retiring as chaplain soon, after 17 years of service with Post 38’s Color Guard. The Color Guard itself bookended the service, by both leading the opening parade which presented the colors, and by completing the service with a 21-gun salute and the playing of Taps. Members of the American Legion Post 38 Color Guard present the colors during the opening parade to Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony. Also during the ceremony, a commemorative wreath was placed at the cemetery’s flag pole, near the grave of Sgt. Brent Woods, a Buffalo Soldier who received the Congressional Medal of Honor after an event in August 1881 in which he saved the lives of his fellow soldiers.",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris played Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev and lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. ‘Furiosa’ sneaks past ‘Garfield’ to claim No. 1 spot over Memorial Day holiday weekend Furiosa won the holiday box office over Garfield by a hair. It was a close race, but the wasteland warrior of “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga” came out slightly ahead of the plump orange cat with an estimated $32 million in ticket sales over the four-day weekend according to studio estimates Monday. “The Garfield Movie,” a Sony release, earned $31.1 million in its first four days. This weekend has also been a sobering one for Hollywood as one of the worst Memorial Day weekend box office showings in decades and the gap may only get bigger. Heat-related monkey deaths climb in Mexico, as environmentalists report deaths of birds and bats MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. And an animal park confirmed around a hundred parrots, toucans, bats and more have died apparently of dehydration in northen Mexico. Last week, environmentalists reported 138 of the midsize primates were found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco. The Environment Department reported that number had risen, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. A wildlife biologist said it appeared to be heat stroke. The department said 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released. Chasing cheese wheels or lugging sacks of wool, UK competitors embrace quirky extreme races LONDON (AP) — Dairy-loving daredevils have thrown caution to the wind for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. In Monday's event, dozens of reckless racers chased 7-pound (3 kilogram) wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill since at least 1826. In the nearby town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds (27 kilograms) up and down Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972. They draw on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town. Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. 14-time champion Rafael Nadal loses in the French Open's first round to Alexander Zverev PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That's why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he isn't 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. He reiterated that Monday. He said after his match, \"If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself.” Grayson Murray's parents say the two-time PGA Tour winner died of suicide Grayson Murray’s parents say their 30-year-old son took his own life. Murray died on Saturday, one day after he withdrew from a PGA Tour event at Colonial. Eric and Terry Murray are asking for privacy and that people honor Murray by being kind to one another. His death comes at a time when Murray appeared to be on track with his life and his golf. He has been open about his struggles with mental health and alcoholism. He said when he won the Sony Open in January that he had been sober for the last eight months. Former 'General Hospital' actor Johnny Wactor killed in downtown Los Angeles shooting LOS ANGELES (AP) — Former “General Hospital” actor Johnny Wactor was shot and killed when he interrupted thieves stealing the catalytic converter from his car in Los Angeles. Police say the shooting occurred around 3 a.m. Saturday when the victim approached three men in downtown LA. His mother, Scarlett Wactor, tells ABC 7 that her 37-year-old son had left work at a rooftop bar with a coworker when he saw someone at his car and thought it was being towed. Scarlett Wactor says a mask-wearing suspect looked up and opened fire. Police say three suspects drove away from the scene. Wactor was rushed to a hospital, where he died. 12 people injured after Qatar Airways plane hits turbulence on flight to Dublin LONDON (AP) — Twelve people have been injured when a Qatar Airways plane flying from Doha to Dublin hit turbulence. Dublin Airport said in a statement that the plane landed safely as scheduled before 1 p.m. Sunday. It said six passengers and six crew members reported injuries after the aircraft experienced turbulence while airborne over Turkey. The airport said all passengers were assessed for injuries aboard the plane, and eight were then taken to hospital. The incident comes five days after a British man died of a suspected heart attack and dozens of people were injured when a Singapore Airlines flight from London hit severe turbulence. Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. to miss the rest of the season after tearing his left ACL PITTSBURGH (AP) — Atlanta Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. will miss the rest of the season after he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during an 8-1 victory at Pittsburgh. The reigning NL MVP led off the game with a double to right-center field off Martín Pérez. With Marcell Ozuna at the plate, Acuña started toward third on a stolen base attempt and his left knee gave way. Acuña remained down for several minutes while being treated, pointing at his left leg before walking off under his own power. The Braves’ initial diagnosis was left knee soreness. But the team announced later that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery.",

        "content": "Netanyahu acknowledges 'tragic mistake' after Rafah strike kills dozens of Palestinians TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that a “tragic mistake” was made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians. Local officials say at least 45 people were killed in Sunday's strike. It only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel’s military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. At least 21 dead in Memorial Day weekend storms that devastated several US states A series of powerful storms in the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend has killed at least 21 people as they left a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coat later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Biden says each generation has to 'earn' freedom, in solemn Memorial Day remarks WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is marking Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation’s fallen toward creating a more perfect union, “for which they lived, and for which they died.” Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden says each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country’s service members is not in vain. Says Biden: “Freedom has never been guaranteed. Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms in Trump hush money trial WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. Perhaps Wednesday, before the jury begins deliberations, the judge is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case. North Korean rocket carrying its 2nd spy satellite explodes in mid-air SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says its attempt to put another spy satellite into orbit has failed. North Korea’s state media say a rocket carrying the spy satellite exploded midair on Monday evening. Monday’s failed launch came hours after leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. The launch drew rebukes from the North’s neighbors because the U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. At least 2,000 feared dead in Papua New Guinea landslide. These are some challenges rescuers face BANGKOK (AP) — The Papua New Guinea government said more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive in a landslide in the South Pacific island nation. The disaster struck after the side of a mountain came down in the early hours of Friday morning when the village of Yambali was asleep. The settlement is located in a restive and remote area in the interior of the poor, rural nation off the northern coast of Australia, making search and rescue efforts complicated and hazardous. Relations between EU and Israel plummet as Spain, Ireland prepare to recognize a Palestinian state BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel are in a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain. Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz has told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. The EU’s foreign policy chief has thrown his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including Hamas leaders. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030. Bill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71 Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance.",

Monday’s failed launch came hours after leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. The launch drew rebukes from the North’s neighbors because the U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. At least 2,000 feared dead in Papua New Guinea landslide. These are some challenges rescuers face BANGKOK (AP) — The Papua New Guinea government said more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive in a landslide in the South Pacific island nation. The disaster struck after the side of a mountain came down in the early hours of Friday morning when the village of Yambali was asleep. The settlement is located in a restive and remote area in the interior of the poor, rural nation off the northern coast of Australia, making search and rescue efforts complicated and hazardous. Relations between EU and Israel plummet as Spain, Ireland prepare to recognize a Palestinian state BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel are in a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain. Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz has told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. The EU’s foreign policy chief has thrown his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including Hamas leaders. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030. Bill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71 Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden marked Memorial Day with a pledge that the United States would continue the work of the nation's fallen toward creating a more perfect union, \"for which they lived, and for which they died for.\" Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden said each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country's service members is not in vain. “Freedom has never been guaranteed,” Biden said Monday under gray skies in the memorial amphitheater. “Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” The Democratic president added: “On this day, we came together again to reflect, to remember, and above all, to recommit to the future they fought for, a future grounded in freedom, democracy, opportunity and equality. Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau , who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits , to highlight the importance of honoring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. Biden said that last year the Department of Veterans Affairs delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever before. He credited the PACT Act, which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned,\" Biden said. \"Not anymore.” Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans and Gold Star family members.",

        "content": "By: PTI Geneva May 28, 2024 00:30 IST Follow Us Facebook Twitter whatsapp World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday referred to the Global Traditional Medicine Centre set up in India and the first global summit on traditional medicine hosted by the country as he underlined that the year 2023 was a productive one in the UN health agency's work supporting access to medicines and other health products. \"We also established the Global Traditional Medicine Centre in India, and hosted the first global summit on traditional medicine,\" Ghebreyesus said in his remarks as he presented his report to the 77th World Health Assembly in Geneva. In March 2022, the Government of India and the UN health agency had signed an agreement to establish the WHO Global Centre for Traditional Medicine. This global knowledge centre for traditional medicine, supported by an investment of USD 250 million from India, aims to harness the potential of traditional medicine from across the world through modern science and technology to improve the health of people and the planet, the UN health agency had said in a press release at the time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said the agreement between the Ministry of Ayush and WHO to establish the Global Centre for Traditional Medicine (GCTM) - world's first - at Jamnagar, Gujarat, is a commendable initiative. He laid the foundation stone of WHO-GCTM in Jamnagar in April 2022. Speaking on the occasion, Modi had said that the WHO-GCTM is recognition of India's contribution and potential in this field. \"India's traditional medicine system is not limited only to treatment. It is a holistic science of life. India takes this partnership as a huge responsibility for serving the entire humanity.” WHO had convened the Traditional Medicine Global Summit in August last year in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. The summit was co-hosted by India, which held the G20 presidency in 2023. It was held alongside the G20 Health Ministerial meeting. The summit explored the role of traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine in addressing pressing health challenges and driving progress in global health and sustainable development. Ghebreyesus had arrived in Gujarat to attend the global summit on traditional medicine and was accorded a warm welcome. Praising India for its \"rich history\" of traditional medicine like Ayurveda and yoga, Ghebreyesus had stressed the need to integrate this ancient medicinal knowledge into the national health system of countries. \"India has a rich history of traditional medicine through Ayurveda, including yoga, which has been shown to be effective in alleviating pain. The Gujarat Declaration, the main outcome of this summit, will focus on integration of traditional medicines in national health systems, and help unlock the power of traditional medicine through science,\" the WHO chief had said. In his address to the World Health Assembly Monday, Ghebreyesus said 2023 was a year of many challenges, but also of many achievements. He said the year 2023 was a productive one in WHO's work supporting access to medicines and other health products. \"We prequalified 120 medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and other products last year for HIV, malaria, multidrug-resistant TB, Ebola, polio and Covid-19, as well as the first long-acting insulin analogues,” he said. He noted that one of the biggest disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic was to routine immunization programmes in many countries, resulting in backsliding coverage and outbreaks of measles, diphtheria, polio, yellow fever and more. \"In April last year, we launched 'The Big Catch Up' with UNICEF and Gavi, to support countries to shut down outbreaks and restore immunization programmes at least to pre-pandemic levels,” he said. In May last year, the WHO chief had declared an end to both Covid-19 and mpox as global health emergencies. “We continue to call on all countries to maintain and reinforce the capacities for surveillance, detection and response that they built during the pandemic. These investments must not go to waste.” © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd First uploaded on: 28-05-2024 at 00:30 IST Here’s Your Exclusive Pass To Premium Stories CLAIM NOW Deepak Tijori on not asking Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan for help Entertainment May 16, 2024 08:01 IST Deepak Tijori, a veteran actor and filmmaker, spoke about his 30-year journey in the industry and the challenges faced by independent producers.

        "content": "After suffering his earliest-ever defeat at the French Open, a tournament he has won a record 14 times, Rafael Nadal said it is unlikely for him to play at Wimbledon next month, even as he eyes a chance to turn out at the Olympics, taking place at his beloved Roland Garros later this year, one last time. “I can’t confirm anything, but I don’t think it’s smart (to play Wimbledon) after everything my body has been through,” he was quoted as saying by AFP at his post-match press conference. “It will be difficult playing on grass, considering that right after Wimbledon are the Olympic Games.” Nadal, hoping to be competitive in his first round against an in-form opponent, showed invariable signs of rustiness after playing only 15 matches since the start of 2023. He bowed out 3-6, 6-7(5), 3-6 to in-form fourth seed Alexander Zverev. The Spaniard was competitive, especially in the second set which he served for before slumping in the tie-breaker, but Zverev’s shotmaking, fitness and power proved too much to handle. Advertisement READ | French Open: Clay god Rafael Nadal’s exit starts end of unprecedented Roland Garros stronghold Nadal said his body had been through the wringer in recent times. “My body has been a jungle for two years. It has been a big fight, waking up as if a snake or a tiger had bitten me. I need to prepare myself and clear my ideas about a calendar. My main goal is to prepare for the Olympics and to prepare well to be healthy here,” he said, per tennismajors.com, at the press conference. The soon-to-be-38-year-old said he takes positives from Monday’s loss to the German. “My feeling is that I wasn’t that far. I was at a good level (in the match),” Nadal added. “If it was the last time I played here, I would be at peace with myself. I tried to do everything I could to play here. At least I did. Even if I lost, that’s part of the business... I don’t know what’s going to happen in the next few months.” Nadal also had the unusual experience of being watched by active players, in competition at the French Open this year, who were in attendance at Court Philippe Chatrier to bear witness to his potentially final outing. “Happy that it happens, it means that I have a positive legacy here,” he said.",

        "content": "A series of powerful storms swept over the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, killing at least 21 people and leaving a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive, early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, said at a Monday press conference that four people had died in four different counties. The death toll of 21 also included seven deaths in Cooke County, Texas, from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas. Two people died in Mayes County, Oklahoma, which is east of Tulsa, authorities said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. The latest community left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny Kentucky community of Charleston, which took a direct hit Sunday night from a tornado that the governor said appeared to be on the ground for 40 miles (64 kilometers). “It’s a big mess,” said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs, hit by a tornado in 2021. “Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever – no water, no power.” Further east, some rural areas of Hopkins County hit by the 2021 tornado around the community of Barnsley were damaged again Sunday night, said county Emergency Management Director Nick Bailey. “There were a lot of people that were just getting their lives put back together and then this,” Bailey said. “Almost the same spot, the same houses and everything.\" Beshear has traveled to the area where his father grew up several times for ceremonies where people who lost everything were given the keys to their new homes. The visits came after a series of tornadoes on a terrifying night in December 2021 killed 81 people in Kentucky. “It could have been much worse,” Beshear said of the Memorial Day weekend storms. “The people of Kentucky are very weather aware with everything we’ve been through.” More than 500,000 customers across the eastern U.S. were without power Monday afternoon, including about 170,000 in Kentucky. Twelve states reported at least 10,000 outages, according to PowerOutage.us . The area on highest alert for severe weather Monday is a broad swath of the eastern U.S., from Alabama to New York. President Joe Biden sent condolences to the families who had people killed. He said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is on the ground conducting damage assessments and he has contacted governors to see what federal support they might need.. It's been a grim month of tornadoes and severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. Storms killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. The severe thunderstorms and deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. That warm moist air is at the northern edge of a heat dome bringing temperatures typically seen at the height of summer to late May. The heat index — a combination of air temperature and humidity to indicate how the heat feels to the human body — is expected to reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in parts of south Texas on Monday. Record highs are forecast for Brownsville, San Antonio and Dallas. Miami set a record high of 96 F (35.5 C) on Sunday.

Associated Press reporters Acacia Coronado in Austin, Texas, and Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed to this report.",

        "content": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, the government said, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. Meanwhile, an animal park in northern Mexico confirmed it has received reports that at least a hundred parrots, bats and other animals have died, apparently of dehydration. A heat dome — an area of strong high pressure centered over the southern Gulf of Mexico and northern Central America — has blocked clouds from forming and caused extensive sunshine and hot temperatures all across Mexico. Last week, environmentalists had reported that 138 of the midsize primates, known for their roaring vocal calls, had been found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco since May 16. Almost two-thirds of the country are expected to see highs of 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday. Late Sunday the Environment Department reported that number had risen to 157, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. Wildlife biologist Gilberto Pozo attributed the deaths to a heat stroke, noting a “synergy” of factors — including high heat, drought, forest fires and logging that deprives the monkeys of water, shade and the fruit they eat — appeared to be to blame, while saying a pathogen, disease or other factor can’t yet be ruled out. The department said deaths were occurring in both Tabasco and the neighboring state of Chiapas, and that 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released back into their habitat. The department said some of the monkeys were being treated for dehydration, and that three were in serious but stable condition. But with heat, fires, and deforestation hitting the trees where the howler monkeys live, it was unclear whether even releasing them could ensure their survival. In the northern state of San Luis Potosi, Ena Buenfil, the director of the Selva Teenek eco-park, told The Associated Press on Monday that her facility has been overwhelmed as parrots, bats, toucans have died due to the heat. Buenfil said when the heat wave began in mid-May their clinic to help animals quickly filled up with sick birds and they received a wave of reports by locals finding dead or suffering birds. Because of scarce resources by authorities, Buenfil said the number is likely only a small percentage of the animals affected, but added that their organization has worked with Civil Protection to aid some birds. Buenfil said birds mainly die of dehydration in the heat, and are often disproportionately affected because they don't have anywhere to store water. Meanwhile, bats would become dehydrated sleeping in the beating afternoon heat. She recommended that locals put out bowls of water for animals. “We’ve never seen a situation like what’s happening right now,” she said, adding if they see more heat peaks like this one “there is not going to be much we can do for the animals.” “There are going to be a lot of casualties to the ecosystem if we continue this trend of heat waves in the region,” said Buenfil. Normally quite intimidating, howler monkeys are muscular and some can be as tall as 90 centimeters (3 feet), with tails just as long. Some males weigh more than 13.5 kilograms (30 pounds) and can live up to 20 years. They are equipped with big jaws and a fearsome set of teeth and fangs. But mostly they’re know for their lion-like roars, which bely their size. With below-average rainfall throughout almost all the country so far this year, lakes and dams are drying up , and water supplies are running out . Authorities have had to truck in water for everything from hospitals to fire-fighting teams. Low levels at hydroelectric dams have contributed to power blackouts in some parts of the country.",

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas , with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel's military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. An initial investigation found that the soldier had responded to an exchange of fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants, Egypt’s state-owned Qahera TV reported. Egypt has warned that Israel’s incursion in Rafah could threaten the two countries’ decades-old peace treaty . Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from Israel's strongest supporters. The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images\" from the strike on Rafah \"are heartbreaking.\" It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. \"There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he wrote. The Foreign Office of Germany, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel for decades, said “the images of charred bodies, including children, from the airstrike in Rafah are unbearable.” “The exact circumstances must be clarified, and the investigation announced by the Israeli army must now come quickly,′ the ministry added. ”The civilian population must finally be better protected.” Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. The ICC only intervenes when it concludes that the state in question is unable or unwilling to properly prosecute such crimes. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "content": "The Maharashtra government will not proceed with all the recommendations from the recently proposed Maharashtra State Curriculum Framework for School Education, said State Education Minister Deepak Kesarkar. The framework had stirred a controversy for using lines from Manusmriti as reference in one of the chapters in the draft, a move that Kesarkar clarified had not received governmental or the steering committee’s approval before being made public. Speaking at a press conference in Mumbai on Thursday, Kesarkar expressed regret in excluding Marathi as a compulsory language. “It happened because the draft was made public without following the proper procedure,” he said. Advertisement Kesarkar also said that the exclusion of English as a compulsory language for Class 11 and 12 was “because the government is working to offer higher education in regional languages, including technical education”. After the minister’s clarification, the SCERT issued a press release late Monday stating that Marathi and English language would be compulsory from Class 1 to 10. It also clarified that Hindi, Sanskrit and other Indian and foreign languages are being offered from Class 6, while Classes 11 and 12 students will have to learn two languages — one Indian and the other foreign. Last week, the State Council of Educational Research and Training unveiled the new Maharashtra State Curriculum Framework (SCF), advocating the integration of Indian Knowledge System (IKS) into School Education (SE). It proposed including texts such as the Bhagavad Gita and Manache Shlok — a composition by Samarth Ramdas Swami — for memorisation enhancement through recitation competitions. A chapter on “value education and disposition” from SCF, which aimed at character-building for students, sparked controversy as it began with a Sanskrit verse from Manusmriti, an ancient Hindu legal text describing the social system. This inclusion drew criticism from various quarters regarding the intent behind the decision. Advertisement Kesarkar addressed the issue, stating, “It was an error on the part of the steering committee that placed the draft in public domain without state government approval. The people involved have expressed regret for this. Let me make it clear, the government does not want to propagate any text and will not include any of this in textbooks.” After the matter came to light, several educationists questioned the decision to the Manusmriti reference. “There are numerous Sanskrit verses conveying similar meanings, yet the draft selects one from Manusmriti. This decision appears either politically naive or intentionally provocative, potentially offending certain segments of the society,” said a renowned educationist. While language policy for Classes 3 to 10 lacked clarity; for Classes 11 and 12, English was categorised as foreign language. Chhagan Bhujbal, Maharashtra Cabinet Minister, also expressed concerns, saying the inclusion of Manusmriti in the curriculum could send a wrong signal among Dalits and OBCs. “Such actions could impact us electorally. This initiative must be halted. Though seemingly insignificant now, it could pose future challenges,” Bhujbal said.",

        "description": "The Portland Trail Blazers legend and Hall of Famer died of cancer at the age of 71, the NBA announced Monday.",
        "content": "PORTLAND, Ore. — People across the basketball world are sharing their memories of Portland Trail Blazers and NBA legend Bill Walton, who died of cancer at the age of 71. Walton, considered one of the best players in Trail Blazers history, led Portland to its lone NBA championship in 1977 and was named Finals MVP. He won a second championship in 1986 with the Boston Celtics, his final full season in the league. Walton was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993. He was also beloved for his work as a sportscaster after his playing career and his life-long work as an advocate for social and political issues (and the Pac-12). Here are some of the reactions from the NBA world: Adam Silver , NBA commissioner: \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events -- always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered. As a cherished member of the NBA family for 50 years, Bill will be deeply missed by all those who came to know him and love him. My heartfelt condolences to Bill's wife, Lori; his sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris; and his many colleagues and friends.\" Julius Erving , NBA legend and Hall of Famer: \"I am sad today hearing that my comrade & one of the sports worlds most beloved champions & characters has passed. Bill Walton enjoyed life in every way. To compete against him & to work with him was a blessing in my life. Sorry for your loss Walton family. We’ll miss him too. Doc\" I am sad today hearing that my comrade & one of the sports worlds most beloved champions & characters has passed. Bill Walton enjoyed life in every way. To compete against him & to work with him was a blessing in my life. Sorry for your loss Walton family. We’ll miss him too. Doc pic.twitter.com/GAEt1DRH8N Magic Johnson , NBA legend and Hall of Famer: \"Rest in peace to a friend, 2X NBA Champion, Hall of Famer, and one of the most skilled centers we’ve ever seen Bill Walton! His NCAA Championship performance as a UCLA Bruin against Memphis is by far the most dominate NCAA Championship performance ever - he shot 21 for 22 and had us all mesmerized! That’s when I first fell in love with his basketball game. They talk about Jokic being the most skilled center but Bill Walton was first! From shooting jump shots to making incredible passes, he was one of the smartest basketball players to ever live. Bill was a great ambassador for college basketball and the NBA, and he will be sorely missed. Cookie and I send our condolences and prayers to his wife Lori, kids Luke, Nathan, Chris, and Adam, and all of his loved ones.\" Ron Wyden , Oregon senator: \"Bill Walton brought Rip City our greatest on-the-court thrills by leading the Trail Blazers on a magical run to the title in 1977. And for decades after his playing days, he brought an entire nation his good nature on life and basketball. I will miss my friend Bill dearly.\" Daryl Morey , Philadelphia 76ers executive: \"RIP Bill Walton - my favorite example of his endless commitment to helping others is when he stepped in to assist the Lithuanian national basketball team as they broke away from the Soviet Union before facing the original Dream Team in 1992.\" RIP Bill Walton - my favorite example of his endless commitment to helping others is when he stepped in to assist the Lithuanian national basketball team as they broke away from the Soviet Union before facing the original Dream Team in 1992 pic.twitter.com/eZVtBZMOBX Los Angeles Clippers : \"We have lost one of the greatest players and personalities that this franchise, this sport and this region have ever known. Bill Walton is synonymous with Southern California basketball: a San Diego native, a UCLA phenom, a Clipper icon. He defined the game as a player, a broadcaster and an ambassador, spreading joy for generations. Wherever he went, whatever he did, Big Red stood above the crowd. The Clippers organization extends our deepest condolences to the Walton family, as well as our utmost gratitude. Bill was a singular force, and we were privileged to know him.\" Pac-12 Conference : \"The Pac-12 is and will forever be the Conference of Champions not because of trophies or medals, but because of the amazing individuals, champions in life, who compete in this league and cement legacies of excellence. There is no better example of this 'Conference of Champions' spirit than Bill Walton. We are heartbroken and devastated to learn of Bill's untimely passing. We offer our sincere condolences and thoughts of love to Bill's family and the entire Pac-12, UCLA Bruins and basketball communities. Bill's list of accomplishments on the court, as massive as they are, are only outweighed by the quality of his character and beauty of his one-of-a-kind loving spirit.\" Sam Amick , longtime NBA reporter: \"Thoughts and prayers to the Walton family and legions of friends that the legendary Bill Walton made in his 71 years. He was larger than life in every sense, and sharing his positive energy and humor until the end.\" Marc Stein , longtime NBA reporter: \"Such incredibly sad news. Bill Walton was one of the most magnetic, engaging, basketball-loving personalities I ever encountered covering this game. He will be so, so, SO missed. Most heartfelt wishes to his son Luke, their whole family and everyone who knew and loved Bill.\" Kevin O'Connor , longtime NBA reporter: \"RIP Bill Walton. Legendary player, incredible broadcaster, and authentic human.\" RIP Bill Walton.

Bill was just a joy to be around, one of the most passionate, engaging, fascinating people I've had the honor of knowing. Always generous with his time and insights. Condolences to his family.\" John Hollinger , former NBA team executive, current NBA reporter: \"Bill Walton was 1 of 1. Always passionate about the game, always had a warm greeting for everyone he saw in the arena - even people like me that he barely knew. What a sad day for basketball.\" Chris Vernon , NBA podcast host: \"RIP Bill Walton. One of my absolute favs. He wrote this letter to my son. Will treasure it forever.\" RIP Bill Walton. One of my absolute favs. He wrote this letter to my son. Will treasure it forever. pic.twitter.com/m8LY3psZnx Mike Barrett , former Trail Blazers broadcaster: \"Had an intense love for life. Happy and peaceful, seemingly always. Always made you feel important and honored. What a gift he was, and what a legacy he leaves.\" Casey Holdahl , longtime Trail Blazers team reporter: \"I wrote a dumb story (my specialty) about players wearing shorter shorts, so I figured I'd reach out to Bill not expecting I'd hear back. Bill ended up talking for an hour (his specialty) with complete sincerity about the virtues of short shorts. And that really encapsulates Bill. Never too big or serious to make you feel silly or small. Always made you feel important because of the time he was willing to give you. Willing to be vulnerable in ways most people avoid at all costs.\" Danny Marang , Portland radio host, host of Jacked Ramsays podcast: \"I remember in my earliest years not liking Walton on game calls. Then, I grew to love his love and appreciation for the people and the game. 'Throw it down, big man!' become one of my favorite calls. Man, this sucks. RIP to a true 1 of 1. No one will ever do it like he did.\" Orlando Sanchez , KGW sports anchor and reporter: \"Heartbreaking to hear the passing of the legendary Bill Walton. One of a kind. Got the opportunity to chat with him a few times over the years. My favorite line of his was, \"I'm the luckiest guy in the world.\" Condolences to his family and loved ones. RIP to a legend.\" Jay Allen , former on-air TV and radio host/reporter for the Trail Blazers: \"Devastated to hear the news of Bill Walton's passing. Through my work with KXL and the Blazers, I had the honor of dining in and broadcasting from his San Diego home. One of my cherished memories of Bill was picking him up at PDX before a Fred Meyer remote. We had some extra time so he asked me to take him to Multnomah Falls. As we walked the trail up to the bridge, people stopped us every few moments to thank him, ask for a picture or autograph, or just say hello. He was patient and gracious with each fan. I will never forget the kindness and generosity he showed me over the years. My condolences to his wife, Lori, and his family. #RIPbigredhead\" Ian Karmel , famous comedian and Blazers fan: \"I'm not sure who is the greatest Blazer of all time, but Bill Walton is the most Blazer of all time. ... This is of course very sad, and especially sad for the people who knew him and aren't just fans from afar like me... but imagine being on your death bed looking back at THAT life. He really went out and did it.\" Dave McMenamin , ESPN NBA reporter: \"We get caught up in 'greatness' conversations about NBA players ad nauseam - Who’s the GOAT? Is this guy better than that guy? Would that guy's game translate to this era? Take some time to read the tributes pouring in about Bill Walton today. That's true greatness.\" Chris Vannini , The Athletic senior writer: The best of Bill Walton on commentary: pic.twitter.com/MqwNQZj2dg This story will be updated with more reactions as they continue to come in.

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of the league's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times' bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.\" It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak.

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of the league's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much.

I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole.

        "content": "Adrienne McGuinness provided a false alibi for infamous killer ‘Cotton Eye’ Joe Delaney Adrienne McGuinness turned up a stereo to drown out murder victim Mark Dwyer’s screams Election candidate Malachy Steenson Adrienne McGuinness at an anti-immigration protest Adrienne McGuinness at and anti-immigration protest ‘Cotton Eye’ Joe Delaney A woman who initially gave a false alibi for a notorious gangland killer in a murder investigation is part of the campaign team for an anti-immigrant candidate in the upcoming elections. Adrienne McGuinness, a prominent anti-immigrant protester from East Wall in Dublin, initially lied for ‘Cotton Eye’ Joe Delaney to give him an alibi for the brutal torture and murder of Mark Dwyer over missing drugs in 1996. McGuinness, who was present in the Co Kildare home where Dwyer was being tortured and turned up the stereo to drown out his screams, was arrested by gardaí in connection with the killing and gave Delaney an alibi saying she had been having an affair with him and slept with him that night. However, she later agreed to testify against Delaney in court and said she had given him the false alibi as she had been frightened of him. Election candidate Malachy Steenson She said she booked into a hotel with Delaney in the aftermath of the killing after she received death threats from a man purporting to be from the INLA over alleged drug pushing and had been given seven days to leave the country. McGuinness is now campaigning for Independent European and local election candidate Malachy Steenson, who in the 1990s was a fringe republican and anti-drug activist who had been targeted by Garda Special Branch and has a conviction from the Special Criminal Court. The pair have found common ground in recent times due to their shared anti-immigration views and have been part of a campaign against the housing of asylum seekers in East Wall in Dublin. Last year, the Sunday World revealed that McGuinness — who previously described refugees as “scammers bleeding us dry” — had a compensation claim thrown out of court because she had failed to disclose previous accidents. Adrienne McGuinness at an anti-immigration protest McGuinness had been awarded €175,000 in compensation over a number of years as a result of various accidents. However, last October she was unsuccessful in a €60,000 claim in Dublin Circuit Civil Court in relation to a minimal-impact car crash which she said left her with a sore neck. Judge Sinéad Ní Chúlacháin told McGuinness she had no option but to throw out her latest claim because she had given evidence of two accidents that she had failed to disclose earlier. Steenson has been linked to various political groups over the years, including the Workers Party and Republican Sinn Féin. Adrienne McGuinness at and anti-immigration protest In 1994, Garda Special Branch raided Steenson’s home in an operation targeting fringe figures linked to Republican Sinn Féin – an anti-peace process republican splinter group. Four years later, in 1998, he lost a court bid to get a licence to drive a hackney after an appeal to Dublin District Court. The carriage office had previously rejected his application for a public service vehicle licence as he had three convictions, including one at the Special Criminal Court for unauthorised taking of a vehicle. Steenson was also a friend of Alan Ryan, who was shot dead after a feud with gangland criminals in 2012. He spoke out after Ryan’s death and later said he did so because Ryan was dealing with drug dealers in society and “the state wasn’t willing to do that”. ‘Cotton Eye’ Joe Delaney While Steenson was part of anti-drug movements in Dublin in the 1990s, he also defended a drug dealer whose home was marched on by local residents. Steenson publicly defended Brendan ‘Fats’ Reilly, saying he was an addict but not a dealer. Reilly was later jailed after being caught with £30,000 of heroin at his home. Meanwhile, McGuinness is not the only anti-immigrant campaigner who was present during Mark Dwyer’s torture. Delaney’s son Scott Delaney , who helped abduct Dwyer before he was tortured and killed by his father, is also part of anti-immigrant protests.",

        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread by Katie Bohn, Pennsylvania State University Teachers and other child educators can benefit from regular professional development, but in-person training can be expensive. New research found that virtual training can be a budget-friendly alternative—and especially effective for certain groups of educators. The study—a collaboration between researchers at Penn State and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and published in the International Journal of Professional Development, Learners and Learning —found that educators who took a virtual training reported feeling more confident in their abilities to implement practices shown to support positive youth development. In particular, after-school providers who did not have a four-year degree and were relatively new to teaching experienced the most growth in their feelings of self-efficacy. Co-author Benjamin Bayly, assistant professor in family studies , child, and youth development in the College of Agricultural Sciences, said the work suggests that virtual professional development has the potential to be an effective way to reach a vast audience of educators who otherwise may not have the opportunity to participate in these trainings. \"Early care and education programs are often limited in financial resources and their workforce is often stretched thin, making it difficult to participate in professional development,\" Bayly said. \"Virtual professional development represents an alternative that is low cost and can be completed on teachers' own time.\" Education quality has a direct impact on children's development, the researchers said, and has been shown to predict future academic success and social and emotional well-being for children of all ages. For teachers and other educators to provide high-quality educational experiences, the researchers said it's important they are trained in and feel confident implementing the most up-to-date pedagogical theories and best practices in their classrooms. This can be achieved through professional development, traditionally completed in person. For example, an early care and education program may bring in an outside expert to conduct a workshop with the aim of improved instructional and emotional support in the classroom. \"However, given the high rate of turnover in early care and education programs , these teachers may leave and be replaced by new teachers who have not completed the workshop,\" Bayly said. \"It may not be feasible for the program to continuously bring in an outside expert to train teachers every time new teachers come on board.\" As an alternative, training can be done in an online setting. Penn State Extension, for example, offers virtual evidence-informed professional development to early care and education and youth-development professionals to improve the quality of their care and educational practices through its program, Better Kid Care. \"All of Better Kid Care's courses are on-demand, meaning professionals can take the course whenever they want,\" Bayly said. \"The vast majority of the courses offered by Better Kid Care are designed to take two hours and are approved for professional development credits in 49 states.\" But while virtual training can reach a larger audience and be more cost effective than in-person professional development, research on its effectiveness has remained mixed. Bayly said he and the rest of the research team wanted to better evaluate the impact of virtual training and whether certain groups may benefit more than others. For the study, the researchers collected data from 3,535 educators accessing positive youth development courses through Better Kid Care. Educators varied in their specific roles, the ages of children they worked with, the level of their own education and how many years of experience they had. After completing the virtual course, educators completed a post-test that asked them questions about what they had just learned, as well as how they would have responded to those same questions before taking the training. This was designed to assess changes in the participants' learning. Participants also were asked to rank how confident they felt in their ability to apply learnings from the course, for example, \"When working with children and youth, I can recognize their individual differences and make changes to activities to meet these differences.\" Taken together, the researchers said the study's findings suggest that on-demand professional development is a promising way to increase educators' self-efficacy, but the courses may have different impacts depending on factors such as education level, role and experience. Bayly said after-school providers without a four-year degree appear to have benefited the most from the virtual training because they were relatively new to the field and likely had not received a comparable amount of training compared to the other educators who completed the course. \"Also, because the courses were dedicated to supporting positive youth development , it is likely that the content resonated with them, which has been shown to impact participants' engagement and the effectiveness of the professional development opportunity,\" Bayly said. The researchers said because there is great variability in the quality of virtual professional development—and as a result, great variability in the effectiveness of the trainings—additional studies should continue to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual professional development, both on its own and in comparison to in-person professional development and hybrid models.

        "description": "Vancouver artist Sang Chul Nam displays his latest work at Fort Langley Community Hall June 1 to 9",
        "content": "A contemporary Vancouver artist with a high-tech show is taking over a new art exhibition space in the historic Fort Langley Community Hall next month. “Hacking the Third Wave II” runs 10 days, colliding past and future in the former-library-space-turned-art-gallery, which is located on the ground floor of the hall. Earlier this year, the long-time Fort Langley Library was temporarily relocated to the former centennial museum space on King Street, consequently vacating the 900-plus-square-foot space, while the library waits to move into its permanent home in the salishan Place by the River cultural centre currently under construction nearby. In the meantime, the vacant area of the hall has been transformed and since dubbed the “Olde Library Space.” It will now be used for art opportunities, said Brigitte Seib, executive director of the community hall. Fort Langley Artist Group (FLAG) was the first to use the space for a four-day pop-up show during the May Day long weekend, and that exhibition will be followed this coming week by a Fort Gallery show, running from June 1 to 9. “Hacking the Third Wave II” was created by multi-media artist Sang Chul Nam and features cosmic paintings, sculptures, and projections—immersing viewers in what he calls a world of possible futures. Nam is a visual and new media/interactive artist exploring the boundaries between visual art and technology in Seoul and Vancouver. For the past 17 years, Nam’s work explored the emotional, interactive, and formative space made through the movement of light – and the combination of painting, objects, video installation, and physical computing. He has displayed his work in numerous exhibitions in Hong Kong, South Korea, plus some 20 other cities around the globe – including Langley. Recently, his interest has shifted towards conveying the message of climate change and the unsettling impact of global warming on the environment. He tries to channel this concern through media and interactive art forms that orchestrate the movement of lights and artificial objects with human interactions. Nam’s latest show explores people’s multifaceted relationship to nature in an increasingly manufactured and technological age. He’s creating a space where he hopes viewers will grapple with the many forms of change facing climate and local ecologies. What he calls a “hopeful and critical” body of work, this exhibit was developed in response to his experience of working as an artist in Seoul. He said he was “saturated with technology to such a degree that he felt his own consciousness and behavioural patterns changing like a machine... trapped in patterns of ‘replication,’ ‘repetition,’ and ‘computation’.” When he relocated to Vancouver, he had a contrasting experience, surrounded by abundant natural spaces. This prompted Nam to explore the question: “what will the world of the future look like if our consciousness is controlled by technological properties, patterns, or behaviours and doesn’t feel the beautiful, emotional waves that come from nature?” Entering the historic community hall space, viewers will encounter abstract paintings and kinetic geometric sculptures, overlaid with projected patterns and interactive lights. Multiple screens will be suspended and layered throughout the space, immersing viewers in “a powerful interplay of organic and artificial elements.” Viewers are invited into a dual investigation of their relationship to nature and technology, as Nam illuminates both the “benefits humans derive from nature and the concerns surrounding the contradictory impacts of technological progress on the environment.” The exhibit is open June 1, 2, 7, 8, and 9, from noon to 4 p.m., and also available for viewing by appointment June 3 through 6. Appointments can be booked via email at . There will also be an artist talk and opening reception held Saturday, June 1, starting with the talk at 2 p.m. and the reception to follow. All events are free and open to the public. Fort Gallery is in its second season of its pop-up programming. Fort Gallery was founded in 2006 as an artist co-op to provide a space for experimental, non-commercial art practice in the Langley area. In 2019 the co-op was dissolved and Fort Gallery became the first and only artist-run-centre in the Fraser Valley. In 2022, after 17 years exhibiting contemporary art in its heritage Fort Langley storefront at the corner of Glover Road and Francis Street, Fort Gallery moved out of this beloved space to begin a new venture as a mobile artist-run-centre. Responding to growing online engagement and the challenge of maintaining a physical gallery in a post-COVID world, the board determined that going mobile was a way to embrace experimentation and reimagine Fort Gallery. Fort Gallery continues hopes to continue bringing engaging, challenging, and thought-provoking contemporary art to the Fraser Valley in alternative and public spaces throughout the region, said board president Alysha Creighton.",

        "content": "ABUJA – The National Chairman of Zenith Labour Party, Chief Dan Nwanyanwu has commended the National Assembly for passing the bill to repeal the current national anthem and revert to the original National Anthem which commenced with the Nigeria’s Independence on October 1st,1960. Chief Dan Nwanyanwu stated this today Monday 27th 2024, during a Press conference at the party National Secretariat in Abuja . Nwanyanwu who also congratulated the lawmakers, said he felt vindicated by the noble act of 10th National Assembly which he said was in complete consonance with his Presidential Manifesto for the 2023 Presidential Election where he vigorously canvassed for the return to Nigeria’s old national anthem. According to him, “What the National Assembly has done, has not only proved that it is sensitive to the yearning’s of the people but it’s also abundantly clear that there was no justifiable reason to have tampered with the 1960 National Anthem of Nigeria to the extent of replacing it with a meaningless anthem that makes mockery of Nigeria’s diversity and yearning for unity. “The National Anthem of a country is so symbolic that it becomes strange that when Military adventurists without any form of consultation or logic, repealed Nigeria’s charished National Anthem by military fiat. Many countries of the world have retained their National Anthem for several centuries as long as they existed as a Nation. Nigeria unfortunately has become a guinea pig that everything is experimented on without a convincing reason. “The 1960 National Anthem of Nigeria touches the very core of our diversity, and religious complexities. Nwanyanwu further stated that the National Anthem evoked emotions and the call for a united Nigeria where equity justice will reign supreme with no citizen oppressed and a section being preponderant over others with clear equity of citizens. “These are the reasons I gave when I canvassed for the reverting to the original National Anthem. I joined all well meaning Nigerians in commending the National Assembly and its leadership for their courage and patriotism in this regard. “I urged Mr President to waste no time assenting to this bill without delay and history will record the enactment of this landmark Act to his credit,” Chief Dan Nwanyanwu added. The Zenith Labour Party also seized the opportunity to commend President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for the achievements recorded since he became Nigeria’s democratically elected President.",

        "content": "SAN JOSE — San Jose police are investigating the city’s 15th homicide of this year, a man who was found dead from a gunshot wound in an apartment complex near a busy shopping mall. The killing occurred at about 2:45 p.m. on Sunday at an apartment in the 1000 block of Blossom River Way, a street that’s adjacent to the bustling Westfield Oakridge shopping center in South San Jose. “When officers arrived, they located an adult male victim who was neither conscious nor breathing and was suffering from at least one gunshot wound,” the San Jose Police Department stated in a prepared release. Police officers immediately began to administer life-saving measures to the victim and at the same time called emergency medical responders to the apartment. But the man died in the apartment, police said. The victim, described as an adult male, wasn’t immediately identified. “The suspect is unknown and fled the scene prior to police arrival,” the police department said. “The motive and circumstances surrounding the event are under investigation.” The Santa Clara County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s Office will release the man’s name once he is identified and his next of kin are notified. Anyone with information is asked to email Detective Sgt. Julien Taylor at 4257@sanjoseca.gov or Detective Mike Harrington 4365@sanjoseca.gov, or call 408-277-5283.",

        "content": "INQUIRER PHOTO / GRIG C. MONTEGRANDE MANILA, Philippines — Analysts expect inflation in the Philippines to settle at an average of 3.7 percent this year, a slight improvement from the 3.8 percent consensus back in April. According to the Monetary Policy Report of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) released on Monday, forecasters surveyed said they expect “within-target inflation over the policy horizon, although settling at the upper end of the target range as uncertainty lingers.” “Upside risks continue to dominate due mainly to supply disruptions,” the BSP said. This is why the BSP is being “very careful” not to cut rates too early to avoid stoking inflation. READ: BSP unlikely to cut interest rates too soon this year, says think tank While average price growth is expected to return to the target band in 2024 after settling above that range in the last two years, BSP Senior Assistant Governor Iluminada Sicat said the central bank was treading lightly when it comes to the timing of easing. “Indeed, we are anticipating that higher inflation rate will be observed from May to July but thereafter, we are projecting that inflation will revert to the target range,” Sicat said at an economic forum on Monday. “We foresee inflation to be within the target, but on the upper end of the target range. That is precisely the reason why the BSP has been very careful not to bring down interest rates too early, or else we may not be able to address some of the upside risks that we are seeing in the future,” she added. The peso became more volatile last week after Governor Eli Remolona Jr. struck a less hawkish tone and floated the possibility of two 25-basis point rate cuts this year, with the first one possibly in August and ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s own easing. READ: BSP chief unfazed by U.S. Fed’s hawkish signals The central bank chief said he was not worried about such a move’s impact on the peso, which may come under pressure if local yields become less attractive to capital inflows while interest rates are still high elsewhere. This month, the BSP’s policy rate was kept at a 17-year high of 6.5 percent for the fifth straight meeting. READ: BSP keeps key rate at 17-year high as inflation risk remains Remolona assured the market that the BSP has “ample reserves” to defend the peso against speculative attacks. A weak currency—which breached the 58-per-dollar level last week—can fan inflation by making imports more expensive. For his part, Finance Secretary Ralph Recto, who also joined the same economic briefing, said a rate cut in the third quarter was “very much possible.” “It all depends on the inflation outlook and I suppose what the Fed does. Those spreads should not be too different between the US and the Philippines or else you might have a flight to safety,” said Recto, who represents President Marcos’ Cabinet in the Monetary Board.

Surely, I don’t expect interest rates to go any higher. If not, there’s time they’ll start going down. Maybe 150 basis points in the next two years,” he added. INQ",

Taking to her Instagram page, Toyin Abraham wrote a lengthy note wishing all parents, who were once children, a Happy Children’s Day. She emphasized the need for better parenting in society, stating that recent observations and encounters compelled her to share this heartfelt message, as the quality of upbringing for today’s children requires serious attention. Toyin Abraham wrote, “I am not happy on this children’s day. “Happy Children’s Day to all children and to parents who were once children. As we celebrate this day, it is essential to acknowledge the need for better parenting. “Recent online encounters and observations compel me to share this heartfelt message with every parent and guardian. “The quality of children we are raising today needs serious attention. We now have kids who see respect and courtesy as burdens. “How do we feel reading some of the things the youth say to adults online under the guise of being “woke” or adopting a “no tolerance” attitude? “Many of us were not raised the way we are raising our kids today. We are raising them with kid gloves because we believe times have changed. However, different times are not an excuse to raise disrespectful children. “Despite our age and blessings, there are still things we would not tell our parents, not out of fear, but out of respect. This Children’s Day should remind us to do better as parents and raise children who are respectful and kind. “The recent tragic event at Ajayi Crowther University, where students killed a fellow student in the name of jungle justice, highlights the severe consequences of a lack of home training and moral values. Even if theft occurred, it does not justify taking another person’s life. “Respect, courtesy, responsibility, kindness, and hard work are values we were raised with. Although we may not have liked the discipline at the time, we are grateful to our parents today for instilling these values in us. We have a nation-building responsibility to raise the next generation of quality individuals. “Happy Children’s Day once again. May God keep our children for us, protect us from all forms of evil, and grant us a great celebration filled with wonderful experiences for the kids. “My name is Toyin Abraham Ajeyemi. I was once a little child, and I am now entrusted with the responsibility of raising quality children for a better society and nation.”",

The Frenchman's contract expires at the end of 2023/24 campaign and having not agreed an extension, he has announced that he will be departing. An open letter to supporters on social media on Monday evening read: \"Dear Manchester United fans, It’s with great emotion that I write to you today to say goodbye. After nine incredible years at the club, the time has come for me to turn a new page in my career. \"Since I arrived in 2015, I have had the immense honour of wearing this shirt and playing in front of you, the best supporters in the world !

With all my affection, Anthony Martial.\" Anthony Martial scored a memorable goal vs Liverpool on his Man United debut ( Image: Getty Images) Who do you think Man United should sign this summer? Share your suggestions below Martial, a 30-time French international, joined the Red Devils in 2015 as a teenager from Monaco. The deal was worth an initial £36m, potentially rising as high as £57.6m. The forward enjoyed a bright start to life at Old Trafford. He scored on his debut with a brilliant solo goal against Liverpool - one of 17 in all competitions that season. He remained a key player for the next few campaigns with his 23 goals in the 2019/20 campaign a career-best. However, inconsistency and injuries blighted his final few years with the club. He joined Spanish side Sevilla on-loan for the second-half of the 2021/22 campaign. Martial made just 19 appearances this season under Erik ten Hag , scoring twice. He has been linked with a move to Inter Milan . Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

        "description": "EastEnders aired the biggest 'doof doof' tonight as Nish Panesar revealed he was dying - but is he telling the truth, or does he have a master plan for his ex Suki Panesar",
        "content": "EastEnders aired a huge return for Nish Panesar tonight - as he dropped the bombshell he is dying. On tonight's episode of the BBC soap, Nish made an unwelcome return to Albert Square, a few weeks after he had been kicked out of the family home for what he had done to Suki over the weeks and years. As he made his return to Walford, he let himself into the house with his spare key and when Ravi threatened to throw him out, he announced to his shocked family that he was dying and it was only a matter of time before he was out of their lives for good. However, fans are convinced they've rumbled that Nish is actually keeping something from the family. Some are rightly suspicious on whether he is telling the truth about his illness and took to social media to share their thoughts. Ravi was unimpressed with Nish coming back to Walford ( Image: BBC) \"Let me guess, Nish is dying in the same way that Angie only had six months to live and Suki had cancer,\" one wrote, whilst another replied: \"I'm leaning towards him actually telling the truth, but with a revenge plan in mind and not the redemption he's claiming. It would be colossally stupid for Vinny and Suki herself not to demand solid proof... The only real option I see for him faking it with \"proof\" is if Nina or some random dodgy doctor (friend of Roger Peele's, maybe?) is helping him. Or I guess they can simply have the entire family be stupid and take his word for it.\" A third added: \"Does Nish genuinely expect his family to what? Forgive & forget, welcoming him back with open arms? Definitely up to something. Had months to plot his revenge #Eastenders ,\" whilst a fourth wrote: \"I have a feeling he’s lying to get back in his family’s good books. #EastEnders .\" A fifth added: \"Nish is 100% lying!! #EastEnders .\" Back in February, Nish actor Navin Chowdry teased more to come in his character's huge storyline. He told us: \"I am alive, I believe so. I had text messages on my phone [during the Christmas episode] going, 'oh no' and then two minutes later 'oh...'. I think despite the whole nation being gutted that I'm still alive, I feel okay about it for now.\" On whether we could see Nish taking revenge or opt for a redemption arc, he went on: \"There’s either redemption or revenge so let's see what happens, there can only be one,\" before warning there was \"unfinished business\" with the Panesars. * Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .",

        "content": "Pakistan paceman Haris Rauf believes that the three months he spent on the sidelines injured with a dislocated shoulder could yet prove a \"blessing in disguise\", as he gears up for the Twenty20 World Cup. The 30-year-old fast bowler made an encouraging return to competitive cricket, taking 2-34, in the second match of Pakistan's warm-up series against T20 world champions England in Birmingham on Saturday. \"I was injured [for] the last few months but if you believe in yourself, then the layoff can be a blessing in disguise,\" he told a pre-match press conference in Cardiff on Monday ahead of the third T20. \"Because you have time to recover and reassess your game-plans. I felt good coming back to cricket. When you play for your country, it makes you very proud.\" As for the mental and physical strain of returning from injury for a fast bowler, Rauf said: \"It's hard. It's a struggle during your rehab, and it's difficult when you come back to maintain that pace and accuracy. But if you believe in yourself, it makes things easier. When I wasn't in the team and rehabbing, I had a lot of time to think about my game and work on myself. \"Thankfully I'm back now, and the World Cup is coming up.\" Rauf's return at Edgbaston could not prevent Pakistan suffering a 23-run defeat by England as they fell 1-0 behind in the four-match series with two to play following a washed-out opener. But Rauf insisted Pakistan, the 2009 T20 world champions, remained in optimistic mood ahead of their opening match at this year's global showpiece against co-hosts the United States in Dallas on June 6. \"When you lose a game it hurts, but as a team, we are confident,\" he said. \"We feel we can beat any opposition on any day. We've done it in the past, too. When you make mistakes you learn and try not to repeat those mistakes. We're looking to play better in the next few games and make a comeback. \"The camp is relaxed. We're enjoying ourselves. We're trying to follow our game-plans and execute them well. The results haven't often been in our favour recently but if you stick to your plans they can sometimes follow.\" England will lock horns against Pakistan in the T20I at the Sophia Gardens in Cardiff on Tuesday, May 28. The hosts are 1-0 up in the four-match series after defeating Babar Azam and his men in the second T20Is courtesy of standout performances from captain Jos Buttler, Will Jacks, Moeen Ali, and Jofra Archer.

The SMILE (Support for Marginalised Individuals for Livelihood and Enterprise)-beggary scheme has been launched by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. At the outset, the DC took a detailed assessment of the proposals received from various NGOs under SMILE-Beggary Scheme. He discussed different aspects of the scheme in threadbare viz identification, transportation, sheltering, vocational training, schooling, health, of the persons involved in begging. On the occasion, the DC stressed on coordinated efforts by all stakeholders for effective implementation of SMILE (Support for Marginalized Individuals for Livelihood and Enterprises) scheme. He called for preparing an efficient roadmap to rehabilitate and facilitate beggars to join mainstream to live a dignified life.",

        "content": "MOHENJO DARO: Sindh on Monday recorded over 52°C (125.6 degrees Fahrenheit) temperature, making it the highest reading of the sizzling summer and close to the country’s record high amid the ongoing heatwave, said the Met Office. Extreme temperatures throughout Asia over the past month were made worse most likely as a result of human-driven climate change, a team of international scientists have said. In Mohenjo Daro, temperatures rose as high as 52.2°C (126 °F) over the last 24 hours, a senior official of the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), Shahid Abbas told Reuters . The reading is the highest of the summer so far, and approached the town's and country's record highs of 53.5 °C (128.3 °F) and 54 °C (129.2 °F) respectively. Mohenjo Daro is a small town that experiences extremely hot summers and mild winters, and low rainfall, but its limited markets, including bakeries, tea shops, mechanics, electronic repair shops, and fruit and vegetable sellers, are usually bustling with customers. But with the current heatwave, shops are seeing almost no footfall. \"The customers are not coming to the restaurant because of extreme heat. I sit idle at the restaurant with these tables and chairs and without any customers,\" Wajid Ali, 32, who owns a tea stall in the town. \"I take baths several times a day which gives me a little relief. Also there is no power. The heat has made us very uneasy.\" Close to Ali's shop is an electronic repairs shop run by Abdul Khaliq, 30, who was sat working with the shop's shutter half down to shield him from the sun. Khaliq also complained about the heat affecting business. Local doctor Mushtaq Ahmed added that the locals have adjusted to living in the extreme weather conditions and prefer staying indoors or near water. The highest temperature recorded in the country was in 2017 when temperatures rose to 54°C (129.2 °F) in the city of Turbat, located in the Southwestern province of Balochistan. This was the second hottest in Asia and fourth highest in the world, said PMD Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz. The heatwave will subside in Mohenjo Daro and surrounding areas, but another spell is expected to hit other areas in the province, including Karachi.",

        "description": "The programme has unlocked Sh11.4 billion in education aid since 2004.",
        "content": "The Kenya Scholar Access Programme (KenSAP) has ridden on an average annual budget of $300,000 (Sh39.3 million) to unlock more than $87 million (Sh11.4 billion) in financial aid to close to 300 bright students in Kenya. Last week, 22 students were offered American university scholarships worth $7.5 Million (Sh980 million) for 2024 entrance to top Ivy League universities and colleges. They have been admitted to Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Amherst, Brown, Claremont McKenna, Colgate, Dartmouth, Davidson, Hamilton, Middlebury, Northwestern, Smith, Tufts, University of Pennsylvania, University of Toronto, Wellesley, and Williams. The scholars comprise the top performers from the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education(KCSE) Class of 2023, selected from all 47 counties in Kenya, and come from underprivileged backgrounds. KenSAP pays for students to participate in its free residential university access programme for nearly six months, guiding them through the American university application process and teaching them the skills they will need to excel in American universities. The universities provide scholarship packages that cover a comprehensive range of expenses, including tuition fees, accommodations, meals, travel costs, and other costs of attendance. The programme continues to provide students with guidance, mentorship, and support while they are studying at university. This financial assistance ensures that the scholars can focus on their academic pursuits without the burden of financial constraints, allowing them to fully immerse themselves in their new educational environments. Speaking during the dinner gala to celebrate the scholars, the principal benefactor and chairman of KenSAP’s Board of Directors, Charles Field-Marsham said it is their commitment to nurture the brightest minds in Kenya from disadvantaged backgrounds. \"By providing these exceptional students with the resources they need, we are not only investing in their futures but also the future of the country and bringing bright Kenyan minds to places all across the world,'' Field-Marsham said. “This achievement shows the potential of a true global citizen within you but there is still much hard work ahead of you to achieve your potential.\" Each year, KenSAP selects 20 students from more than 1,000 highly qualified applicants. Just to apply, candidates must rank among the top 1⁄10 of one per cent of all test takers on the KCSE. KenSAP’s selection process, like that of the universities to which its students apply, is holistic, taking into consideration a range of criteria beyond the purely academic, such as family background, extracurricular accomplishments, commitment to community development, and leadership potential. The selected students spend 20 weeks in residential training free of charge, with KenSAP covering all of their costs of attendance. In this training programme, they prepare for university entrance Since 2006, every student taken into the programme has earned admission, with full financial aid, to a distinguished American college or university. Since its inception in 2004, more than 80 KenSAP beneficiary students have returned to Kenya to work at leading companies and institutions. The programme was launched when Kenyatta University Professor Mike Boit and American journalist friend John Manners initiated a successful pilot scheme with a group of five students which was a year later scaled to 12-15 students. The founding sponsor Charles Field-Marsham stepped in to ensure management stability and financial sustainability for the programme, providing 95 per cent of its funding until 2017, when he and Alan Davidson, KenSAP’s current executive director, led the programme to a more sustainable fundraising approach. Nowadays, the programe relies on alumni to fundraise almost 20 per cent of the annual budget, and in the past few years, they have given more than $350,000 of their own money back to KenSAP. The team has also been finding other sources of sustainable financial support through Kenyan corporates such as those in attendance at the Annual Charity Dinner Gala. The organisation's vision aligns with a time when private and public stakeholders are being called up to embrace sustainable practices by adopting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a guide to assist in the attainment of inclusive and equitable quality education.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The testimony in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It's impossible to say how long all of that will take, but in a landmark trial that's already featured its fair share of memorable moments , this week could easily be the most important. Here's what to expect in the days ahead: Starting Tuesday morning, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments expected to last for much of the day, if not all of it. The arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election to a porn star who alleged she had a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations. Look for prosecutors to remind jurors that they can trust the financial paperwork they've seen and the witnesses they've heard from. That includes porn actor Stormy Daniels , whose account of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump is at the heart of the case, and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme and authorized payments. It's worth remembering that the defense, which called only two witnesses but not Trump, doesn't have to prove anything or convince jurors of Trump's innocence. To prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases. Expect the defense to try to poke holes in the government's case by disputing Daniels' testimony about her hotel suite encounter with Trump and by distancing Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements to Cohen, who was responsible for the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels. The defense may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid. And it'll certainly attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand . How much of his testimony the jury believes will go a long way in determining the outcome of the case. Since the prosecution has the burden of proof, it will deliver its summation last — the reverse order from opening statements, in which the prosecution went first. A critical moment will take place, perhaps Wednesday morning, before the jury begins its deliberations. Judge Juan M. Merchan is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence. In an indication of just how important those instructions are, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a spirited debate last week outside the jury's presence as they sought to persuade Merchan about the instructions he should give. The Trump team, for instance, sought an instruction informing jurors that the types of hush money payments at issue in Trump’s case are not inherently illegal, a request a prosecutor called “totally inappropriate.” Merchan said such an instruction would go too far and is unnecessary. Trump's team also asked Merchan to consider the “extraordinarily important” nature of the case when issuing his instructions and to urge jurors to reach “very specific findings.” Prosecutors objected to that as well, and Merchan agreed that it would be wrong to deviate from the standard instructions. “When you say it’s a very important case, you’re asking me to change the law, and I’m not going to do that,” Merchan said. Prosecutors, meanwhile, requested an instruction that someone’s status as a candidate doesn’t need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign. Defense lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn’t running, it shouldn’t be treated as a campaign contribution. The deliberations will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that's intentionally opaque. Jurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it's hard to read too much into the meaning of any note. It's anyone's guess how long the jury will deliberate for and there's no time limit either. The jury must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that could take some time, and a verdict might not come by the end of the week. To reach a verdict, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it. Things will get trickier if the jury can't reach a consensus after several days of deliberations. Though defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial, Merchan is likely to call the jurors in and instruct them to keep trying for a verdict and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others. If, after that instruction, the jury still can't reach a verdict, the judge would have the option to deem the panel hopelessly deadlocked and declare a mistrial.

        "content": "Indigo Books & Music Inc. shareholders have voted to approve a deal that will see the retailer become a private company. Shareholders voted Monday in favour of a $2.50 per share offer from Trilogy Retail Holdings Inc. and Trilogy Investments L.P., which already held a 56 per cent stake in Indigo. The Trilogy companies are owned by Gerald Schwartz, the spouse of Indigo chief executive Heather Reisman, and had originally offered $2.25 per share but raised their bid in April. \"We are pleased with the result of today's vote and look forward to continuing our work on Indigo's transformation strategy,\" Reisman said in a statement shared with CBC News. \"We remain deeply committed to our customers and to all our stakeholders as we work together to inspire reading and enrich the lives of booklovers across the country.\" Indigo agrees to go private after sale to holding company owned by chief executive's spouse Meet Gerald Schwartz, the billionaire behind the Onex and WestJet deal For Trilogy's offer to be accepted, it required approval by a two-thirds majority vote of Indigo shareholders and a simple majority vote by shareholders not linked to Trilogy and its affiliates. Slightly more than 95 per cent of votes from shareholders represented at Monday's meeting were in favour of accepting the deal. Out of the shareholders that were independent of Trilogy or its affiliates, just shy of 83 per cent of the votes supported the offer. A package from Indigo's e-commerce unit is shown in a shipping processing facility in December 2022. Some 95.09 per cent of votes from shareholders represented at the meeting Monday were in favour of accepting the deal between Indigo and Trilogy. (Evan Mitsui/CBC) 'Bleeding cash' The privatization allows Indigo to avoid some scrutiny as it works to bring profitability and growth back to Canada's biggest bookstore. \"The rationale is not to be saddled with public reporting responsibilities because Indigo has been through a lot,\" said Richard Leblanc, a professor of governance, law and ethics at York University in Toronto, in February, when the Trilogy firms made their offer. Trilogy now faces a hefty amount of work. Indigo is still recovering from a cyber attack that downed its website for a lengthy period last year, a series of quarterly losses leading up to a January layoff, and a succession of changes that saw four of 10 board members depart last year with one claiming mistreatment and \"a loss of confidence in board leadership.\" Philanthropists Gerald Schwartz and Heather Reisman clap and blow kisses to the crowd during an announcement of their donation to the University of Toronto on Monday, March 25, 2019. The companies buying Indigo are owned by Schwartz. (Cole Burston/The Canadian Press) Reisman, who retired amid the turmoil, returned within months to helm Indigo. The issues have played out as inflation and high interest rates make many Canadians think twice about opening their wallets, especially for the discretionary items Indigo is known for. The trend cropped up particularly in the holiday season, when Indigo executives admitted they had overbought merchandise and stocked an assortment of merchandise they found customers weren't looking for in the final weeks before Christmas. \"Despite all their best efforts, they are not doing well,\" Kai Li, the Canada Research Chair in corporate governance who teaches at the University of British Columbia, said of Indigo in February. \"They are bleeding cash.\" Sale expected to close in June To turn things around, Indigo has been carrying out a transformation plan since at least November. It's offered few specifics, but Reisman, who founded the chain in 1996, has said it is meant to \"return Indigo to both growth and profitability.\" An Indigo bookstore is seen Wednesday, Nov. 4, 2020 in Laval, QC. Trilogy hasn't said much about its plans for Indigo beyond it wanting to take the company private, but no public opposition to the deal has mounted. (Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press) In the months since she mentioned the plan, some stores have seen wellness products and the popular American Girl dolls culled from their shelves and Columbus Cafe & Co. has moved into some Indigo spaces previously held by Starbucks. Reisman has also pledged in newsletters to bring back its digital inventory search kiosks, program more events and add seating to more stores. Trilogy hasn't said much about its plans for Indigo beyond it wanting to take the company private, but no public opposition to the deal has mounted, likely because the money offered reflected a 69 per cent premium on the share price of $1.48 that Indigo had when Trilogy first made its bid. Indigo's share price sat at $2.48 ahead of the Monday vote. Last month, the offer garnered the support from a special committee of independent directors Indigo formed to assess the deal. Earlier this month, Indigo also said that leading independent proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis had recommended shareholders approve the deal. Indigo has said it expects the transaction to close in June and its shares to be delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange sometime after.",

        "content": "Business experts and real estate professionals have shared valuable insights on resilience, adaptability, and financial independence to drive the sales industry in Nigeria. Speaking at the Sales Pro- Conference in Lagos, the experts discussed strategies that would enable the sector to thrive in challenging economic times. The event, organized by Pertinence Group and themed ‘Selling in Tough Times,’ featured a lineup of distinguished speakers who shared valuable insights on resilience, adaptability, and financial independence in the sales industry. Co-founder of Pertinence Group, Sunday Olorunsheyi, set the tone for the conference with an inspiring keynote, emphasizing the importance of financial independence for sales professionals. In his words, “One of the major motivations for becoming a Sales pro is the desire for financial independence. Dig your well before you’re thirsty, know the tune before you start dancing, don’t dine with naysayers and doubters of your dreams, stay in control to unleash your potential, leverage information and detest poverty.” Top real estate saleswoman, Confidence Molade, delivered a compelling presentation on embracing change and seizing opportunities in tough markets. Molade highlighted the significance of staying positive and building trust and credibility, stating, “Sales is the lifeblood of every business. If you are not selling, you are not in business. “To make sales in a tough market, you must protect your mind from bad news, stay positive regardless of the conditions, and then learn to build trust and credibility.” Another Co-founder of Pertinence Group, Wisdom Ezekiel, addressed the critical topic of financial freedom for sales professionals in Nigeria, stressing the importance of financial literacy and planning for economic stability and growth. Serial entrepreneur Victor Gbenga Afolabi spoke on the psychology of selling during difficult times, emphasizing the fundamental role of selling in achieving success. “It is almost impossible to be successful without mastering the art of selling,” Afolabi stated, highlighting the significance of understanding that hard times are a natural part of life and not a barrier to closing deals. The conference also featured a panel session where veteran real estate consultants shared their personal experiences and opinions on the ever-evolving field of sales in real estate. Attendees had the opportunity to win special prizes through a raffle draw, with six winners receiving rewards ranging from a brand new mobile phone and high-tech drone gadget to exclusive mentorship slots with the Pertinence Group co-founders.",

        "content": "WARSAW, May 27: Defense officials in NATO member Poland on Monday presented a plan to strengthen anti-drone surveillance and on-ground military defense through a system of fortifications and barriers along about 700 kilometers (430 miles) of its eastern border with Russia and Russian ally Belarus. The government says Poland, which supports neighboring Ukraine in its defense against Russia’s aggression, is being targeted by hostile actions from Russia and Belarus. They include cyberattacks, attempted arson and migrants being pushed illegally across the border, which officials describe as intended to destabilize the European Union, of which Poland is a member. The government is also making preparations in the case of a military attack, while stressing the primary role of deterrence. The government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk has planned a range of security measures including in cyberspace, as well as a more than $2.5 billion investment in strengthening surveillance, deterrence and defense along the eastern border, a system known as Shield-East that is to be completed in 2028. Work on it has started, officials said. “The goal of the shield is to protect the territory of Poland, hamper the mobility of our adversary’s troops while making such mobility easier for our own troops and to protect civilians,” Defense Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz said at a news conference, adding that local communities understand the need for such steps. The shield will include “all kinds of fortifications, barriers, monitoring of the air space on every level and upgrading the existing systems,” and will be integrated with the defense system across the country, Kosiniak-Kamysz said. He stressed it was the biggest program to strengthen NATO’s eastern flank since 1945, when World War II ended. Chief of Staff Gen. Wiesław Kukuła said it will include a network of state-of-the-art anti-drone monitoring and defense towers, anti-tank barriers and ditches, bunkers and shelters, as well as space for potential mine fields. He stressed their primary role is to deter any potential aggressor. The officials said the system will be part of a regional defense infrastructure built jointly with the Baltic states — Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia — that are also on NATO’s eastern flank. The funding will come from the government, as Poland spends over 4% of its GDP on defense, but help will also be sought from the EU because the system will also strengthen the eastern border of the 27-member bloc, they said. Some observers noted that the much-publicized presentation came two weeks ahead of elections to the European Parliament, where Poland, a nation of some 38 million, holds 52 seats, and could be partly seen as a campaign element for the government that took office in December. The opposition also supports strengthening Poland’s defense. Poland’s previous right-wing government built a $400 million wall on the border with Belarus to halt a massive inflow of migrants that began to be pushed from that direction in 2021. The current pro-EU government says that needs to be strengthened, but will be a separate project from Shield-East. The three Baltic states were once part of the Soviet Union, while Poland was a satellite state before the 1990s. Moscow still regards the area as within its sphere of interest. To its east, Poland borders Russia’s exclave of Kaliningrad, as well as NATO ally Lithiania, Moscow’s ally Belarus, and Ukraine. (AP)",

        "content": "Photo: Ian Usher on Unsplash The Ministry of Innovation, Science and Industry has ordered the shuttering of two B.C. based technology companies, one of which makes drones with military applications. In a brief statement posted Friday (May 24), Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne said two companies must be dissolved, following a national security review. The companies in question are Bluvec Technologies Inc. and Pegauni Technology Inc. “The government’s decisions are based on facts and evidence and on the advice ofCanada’s security and intelligence community, and other governmentpartners,” Champagne said in the news release. “While Canada continues to welcome foreign direct investment, we will act decisively when investments threaten our national security.” Bluvec, based in Burnaby, makes a drone detection system, which has potential military applications. As reported by Glacier Media last year, Bluvec was successfully sued by another Burnaby drone detection company , Skycope Technologies for stealing proprietary source code. The founders of both Bluevec and Skycope were friends who originally worked for the same cybersecurity company in China, according B.C. Supreme Court documents. The principals of Bluvec identified in the lawsuit are Junfeng Jia (aka Jack Jia), Leyuan Pan (aka Michael Pan), Kunyu Zhang (aka Eric Zhang) and Qianqi Zhuang (aka Tim Zhuang). Also listed as defendants in the case were Xiaoqian Wu (aka Karl Wu) and Jiawei Li. The principal of Skyscope Technologies is Zhenhua (Eric) Liu, according to the court ruling. The court case notes that both Bluvec and Skyscope developed technology that “enables users to detect and block or ‘jam’ unwanted drones.” Bluvec and two of its principals – Junfeng Jia and Leyuan Pan – were ordered to pay Skycope Technologies $800,000 for breaching employment agreements with Skycope. Reached for comment, a spokesperson for Bluvec said Jack Jia was unavailable.",

        "content": "Despite 64 per cent of Africans expressing confidence in the continent, they remain loyal to brands outside of the continent, says Brand Africa in its latest Africa 100: Africa’s Best Brands research and rankings. The report also revealed that African nations account for 64 per cent of the Top 50 most admired countries, with South Africa, Nigeria, the United States, China, and Kenya the top 5 countries perceived to contribute to a better Africa. The report added: “All members of the newly expanded 9-member BRICS block, except Iran, made the list, that’s dominated by Southern and West Africa which account for 44 per cent of the Top 50 nations Africans admire globally.” According to the findings, South African telecommunications group, MTN, Nigerian conglomerate, Dangote, Zambian consumer group, Trade Kings, Nigerian telecommunications group, Glo, South African media group, DStv and Ethiopian Airlines retain their respective positions as the Top 5 most admired African brands. It added that 14 per cent African share in the ranking came from six countries – South Africa and Nigeria scored five points each, Ethiopia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania one point each. The report showed Europe retained its 37% share of the Top 100, while North America declined 12.5 per cent to 28 per cent as Asia grew its share by 23.5 per cent to capture 21 per cent of the African market. According to the ranking, Nike, Adidas, Samsung, Coca Cola and Apple have all retained their positions for the 5th consecutive year as the Top 5 most admired brands in Africa. The report noted: “In an interesting insight, affirming how entrenched non-African brands are in Africa, many such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Samsung, Lacoste, Total (Energies) and Guinness are mistakenly recalled among the most admired ‘African’ brands when the question is asked, ‘What African brands do you admire?” Among organisations, UNICEF (originally called the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund) and UN, are the most admired NGOs, Coca-Cola is the most admired non-African organization, and MTN is the number one African brand. “While the share of African brands remains a disappointing 14 per cent, with Africans overwhelmingly believing that mostly Africa will contribute to a better Africa, as nations continue to create an enabling environment for African entrepreneurs and the AfcFTA opportunity is realized, it’s just a matter of time, but ultimately the share of African brands will increase,” says Thebe Ikalafeng, founder and chairman of Brand Africa. Recognising that brands are a vector of a nation or organisation’s identity, reputation competitiveness, every year, since 2011, Brand Africa, through its independent research partners, Kantar, Geopoll across sub-Sahara Africa, Integrate in North Africa, and Analysis in the East African Islands, conducts research in over 30 markets which account for as much as 85 per cent of the continent’s GDP and population. The results are published as the lead cover story in the June edition of African Business, the continent’s foremost business magazine since 1966. Over the next few weeks, Brand Africa will release country-specific results in key countries across the continent.",

        "content": "....Targets Displeased Voters, Others As Nigeria grapples with the best solution to address issues in the country, African Democratic Congress (ADC) on Monday said that the right set of leaders will change the situation in the country. This is even as the party further said that it’s desirous of ensuring that voters, who are displeased with the outcome of last election, are encouraged to engage the process in future polls. Speaking at the opening of a retreat for ADC executives tagged: “What Nigerian Voter Want – A Strategic Public Engagement,” the former presidential hopeful of the party, Chukwuka Monye, who is also a Board of Trustees (BoT) member of the party said that ADC wants to do something different by hearing from Nigerians so that they can go back and think and come up with practical solutions. Speaking on the voter apathy, Monye said many Nigerians are not happy with the way the elections turned out and that some won’t want to come back and participate in the process again. He said: “We need to know if they would come back and on what basis they would return to vote again. “ADC will listen and develop game plans based on what the panellists tell us.” He added that the recommendations will form a basis for ADC development road plan, adding that the gathering was important because what Nigerians want is what matters. According to him, some of the members on the panel are drivers, market women, and other people from regular walks of life. He said: “They are important to us. Not many parties out there seek to understand what Nigerians want. ADC is thinking about the operations of the party not waiting till 2027.” Monye, who stressed that getting the right set of leaders will change the situation in Nigeria, added that the issues of leadership accountability and voter apathy will be deliberated on during the retreat. On his part, ADC National Chairman, Ralph Okey Nwosu said, “we want to hear from all the people that have attended.” He said the gathering will be held around the country, adding that it will enable the party to work out policies based on the feedback they get.",

This move aims to expand local ownership and comply with regulatory requirements, the company announced over the weekend. The Uganda unit of JSE-listed MTN Group has obtained regulatory approval for this additional share sale, according to a statement published in The East African newspaper. In its initial listing three years ago, MTN Uganda aimed to sell 20% of its shares to local investors but only achieved 60% of that goal. MTN Uganda will offer the remaining shares on the secondary market of the Uganda Securities Exchange (USE) between May 27 and June 10. With a subscriber base of about 15 million people, MTN Uganda also provides mobile money financial services. Its main competitor in the market is the local unit of Bharti Airtel.",

        "content": "Lisa Armstrong was happy to hang out with friends amid reports she’s preparing for a custody battle over the dog she shares with ex-husband Ant McPartlin . The 47-year-old make-up designer was married to 48-year-old Ant from 2006 until 2018 and stood by him when he battled drug and alcohol addictions. Together, they share a chocolate Labrador named Hurley - and while they have shared custody of him since their explosive split, things are tipped to change. Over the bank holiday weekend, however, Lisa appeared to let her hair down and forget her custody worries as she relaxed with friends. Lisa - who is the head make-up designer on the smash BBC show Strictly Come Dancing - got dressed up and dazzled with a bright smile as she enjoyed a girls’ night out. The beauty expert and two friends posed together for a social media snap as they attended an event run by So Oxford and as they partied together. Lisa stunned in a pair of black lace trousers and a low cut top that featured floral prints. She later shared a quote via Instagram Stories simply stating: \"If it makes you happy then it's not a waste of time.\" Lisa enjoyed a night out with friends over the bank holiday weekend ( Image: Instagram) Lisa and ex-husband Ant McPartlin divorced in 2018 ( Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock) Virgin Media offers gamers the chance to get £250 but you'll need to act quickly In recent weeks, Lisa has made reference to the changes in her former husband’s life. After leaving Lisa, Ant coupled up with PA Anne-Marie Corbett and he later married her in 2021. This year, the couple welcomed their first child together. Fans noted that Lisa shared a string of quotes via social media that could have been interpreted as a response to her ex’s happy news. One quote shared by the star said: \"Be proud of how you have been handling these past few months. The silent battles you've fought, the moments you've had to humble yourself, the times you've wiped your own tears. Celebrate your strength.\" She later shared a quote attributed to the late Winston Churchill which read: \"I no longer listen to what people say, I just watch what they do. Behaviour never lies.\" Social behaviour and relationships expert Judi James said of the posts: \"Lisa's posts sound cryptic, a very tiny wave to the fans to hint at her feelings. Her first 'big hint' came following the birth and it reads like a motivational pep talk someone had sent her. \"Her hint is presumably that it was accurate about the 'humbling yourself' and 'wiping your own tears'. Without writing a personal description of her feelings and emotions, this post seems to suggest that is what Lisa has been going through.\" Meanwhile, reports this month have suggested Lisa is preparing to battle Ant for sole custody of their dog. The make-up expert - who won a reported £31 million in her divorce - has been turning to her pooch for comfort. A source told The Sun: “She felt very betrayed by both Ant and Anne-Marie and felt that none of this has been handled sensitively, especially the announcement of the baby. She’s really been through it all in the past seven years and sometimes she amazes herself how strong she’s been. But the one thing that has got her through it and been by her side constantly is Hurley – she doesn’t know what she would do without him. He’s more than just a dog to her and has been a lifeline at times.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads.",

        "description": "The local iwi has placed a rāhui over the inner harbour until Thursday morning.",
        "content": "Rescue crews have found the body of the man believed to have fallen overboard on a Wellington ferry. A police spokesperson said the discovery was made in Wellington Harbour yesterday evening by the Police Dive Squad, with help from the Royal New Zealand Navy. The search-and-rescue mission was sparked on Friday after the sole passenger aboard the 6am sailing from Queens Wharf to Days Bay was nowhere to be found as the vessel approached its destination. Up to 14 vessels and a rescue helicopter scoured Wellington Harbour on Friday when the man was first reported missing. Police were urgently seeking information to identify the man. The spokesperson said inquiries would continue today, including the formal identification of the man. A rāhui has been placed over the inner harbour and local iwi Te Āti Awa said a karakia. The rāhui will stay in place until Thursday morning at 6am. “The iwi request that kaimoana is not taken from the inner harbour out of respect for the whānau pain [grieving family] as they face the challenge ahead of them,” a police spokesperson said. “A number of inquiries still need to be made, and at this time Police are unable to comment further.” On Friday, deputy harbourmaster Patrick Atwood said he understood ferry staff had called for help upon noticing the passenger was missing. East by West Ferries general manager Mat Jonsson said the ferry crew issued a mayday call and began to search as soon as they became aware the passenger was missing. “We called in a second harbour ferry to assist with the search, which was joined by other vessels responding to the mayday.” Maritime New Zealand Rescue Co-ordination Centre NZ co-ordinated the on-water search effort using detailed modelling and analysis of the harbour, Greater Wellington Regional Council said. “The Greater Wellington whānau is deeply saddened by this incident. Our thoughts are with the crew of the 6am sailing and East by West staff as well,” chairman Daran Ponter said. Share this article",

        "description": "The public have until tomorrow to have their say on council bill.",
        "content": "The coalition Government is pushing hard to pass a bill allowing councils to disestablish Māori wards or to hold polls on whether the ward should be continued. The bill has passed its first reading in Parliament. The proposed referendums will be held during 2025 elections and results will be binding, taking effect in the local government term in 2028. In 2022 Labour abolished the requirement for councils to hold a referendum before creating Māori wards to ensure the government would respect the Treaty partnership through Māori representation in local government decision-making. That resulted in Aotearoa going from three councils with Māori wards to 49. Opponents have described the lack of referendums as undemocratic and divisive. Stuff featured an article by New Plymouth councillor Dinnie Moeahu, who argued Māori wards were a democratic tool that ensured proportional representation and that equitable opportunities were part of the democracy. And Dr Annie Te One said that without Māori wards, Māori were consistently underrepresented, “which means our ability to actually develop a sustainable Te Tiriti o Waitangi governance framework is also not able to be done, so really they are democratic and good for everyone”. In response to Local Government Minister Simeon Brown’s announcement in April that the Government would bring back the referendum, the Waitangi Tribunal held an urgent inquiry, Wai3365, and found the Crown had breached Te Tiriti by failing to consult with Māori. It found the legislation would likely raise human rights issues under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and breach the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. Breaches detailed in the report are as follows: * the principle of partnership; * the duty to act in good faith; * the Crown’s duty to actively protect the rights and interests of Māori; * the principle of equity; * the principle of mutual benefit; * the duty to consult with Māori; and * the breach of options - that being the option of Māori voters to choose whether to be represented by general or Māori wards councillors. The public has until tomorrow to submit on the Local Government (Electoral Legislation and Māori Wards and Māori Constituencies) Amendment Bill. Share this article",

She said, “Fans always try to pit me against other female artists. Any new female artist that comes up, they would be like, ‘Yo, she is coming to take her throne.’ “And I would go out of my way to make friends with them (new female artists) because it is not a competition.

        "content": "Robin Swann has recently returned as Stormonts health minister (Image: Liam McBurney/PA) Drastic spending cuts in the healthcare service would still leave a £189million budget deficit, Robin Swann has warned. The Health Minister has told Executive ministers and members of the health committee that “deep dive” cuts to health spending would not avoid a multimillion-pound overspend in the department. Mr Swann sent the letter and cost-saving analysis by the health trusts in Northern Ireland, seen by the PA news agency, on the eve of a key Assembly debate on the budget. Read more: Special school principal tells parents 'don't blame staff' ahead of closures Read more: NI Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris won’t stand in General Election The budget has already been approved by the wider Executive and is expected to be approved by the Assembly. The health service has been allocated more than half of the Executive’s £14.5 billion resource budget. Mr Swann had bid for an additional £1 billion for health – an amount that represented the entirety of the uncommitted funding available for distribution among all Stormont departments. Instead, an additional £500 million was allocated by the Stormont Executive in late April. Health trusts in Northern Ireland had been asked to work up cost-saving plans as part of efforts to bridge the gap, but Mr Swann has said these spending projections had confirmed “my worst fears about the consequences of the budget”. He warned that no Ulster Unionist Party health minister would approve cost-saving measures “with such catastrophic impacts”. UUP deputy leader Robbie Butler has said the party would not quit the Executive, but Mr Swann’s warning on Monday raises the possibility of the health minister overspending his budget in the current financial year.

Mr Swann wrote to his fellow Executive ministers: “The assessment details that even after extensive deep dive savings measures, a remaining deficit of £189m is anticipated. “That estimated deficit is in addition to the fact that no funding is provided in the Executive’s budget for staff pay increases, meaning further industrial action is all but inevitable in the year ahead.” The analysis by trusts said possible “contingency” savings measures included recruitment freezes for “non-frontline” staff and further reductions in agency and locum costs, but the analysis states that such savings “will be challenging in a single year and may not be achievable in their entirety”. “This leaves a remaining and significant deficit of £189m (assuming no pay increase in 2024/25),” it said, but warned that this level of savings “cannot be achieved without high/catastrophic impact measures”. It said that all trusts had expressed “grave concerns” about the impact on health and social care services at both local and regional level if such savings measures were to be requested. Some of the “projected” requirements include a reduction of around 400 acute hospital beds across Northern Ireland, a reduction of around 1,200 staff; an estimated reduction of 1,100,000 hours of homecare/domiciliary care type support over a year; and an estimated reduction of around 500 care home beds. It said that a more detailed assessment will be needed on contingency plans and ministerial approval would be needed for high/catastrophic impact measures. Mr Swann called the analysis both “hugely concerning” and “fair and balanced”. “It is the most alarming advice I have received in my time as Minister, outside of the Covid-19 pandemic.” Urging his Stormont colleagues to reconsider the vote on the budget, Mr Swann added: “Both before and after the latest restoration of the local institutions, promises were made and commitments were given that the health of our people would be prioritised. This budget does not do that. “Even without implementing the most damaging cost saving measures, this budget will make the challenges in our health worse instead of better.” Join our Belfast Live breaking news service on WhatsApp Click this link or scan the QR code to receive breaking news and top stories from Belfast Live.

        "content": "May 27, (THEWILL) – The National Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE) has declared persona non grata at the general manager of Turkish airlines, Mr Lookman Balkan, refuting claims seven Nigerian staff sacked by the airline were involved in $600,000 ticket racketeering. In a statement signed by Ochene Aba, General Secretary of NUATE, on Monday, the union said the “accusations are blatant and poorly formulated lies.” The airline had claimed last week that it dismissed seven Nigerian staff because they violated various ticketing reservation rules, costing the airline significant economic loss to the tune of over $600,000. But the union explained that the “claim that the airline lost $600,000 is mere phantom.” NUATE explained further that sometime in April 2023, Turkish Airlines’ headquarters issued a sales restriction circular which allowed sales of only two premium classes of tickets, as a response to foreign airlines’ difficulty in repatriating their proceeds to home countries due to foreign exchange constraints in Nigeria. It added that, however, “In a contradicting manner, the Airline had an advertised fare on the website which was much lower than the permitted fares. Therefore, intending passengers who accessed such fare, but could not pay online were directed by the global call centre to approach the Nigerian offices, adding that as the workers could not attend to the customers due to the sales restriction, the passengers resorted to creating ugly scenes at the sales offices which became riotous at times. “As an image saving measure, the then sales manager asked the sales staff to use the PNR obtained online by the customers to process the tickets if the Airline’s booking system could route the tickets. The sales staff simply complied. As a matter of fact, the then sales manager, a Turkish national, sold these tickets too to confirm that this was the local management’s approved approach to resolving the problem created by the website. “The Airline’s accountants received all due monies from all tickets sold and all sales report were daily submitted to sales manager, signed by him and accounts department and scanned to Headquarters. If monies were not fully received, the account would not have balanced, and sales could not have been concluded. Therefore, no monies belonging to Turkish Airlines is missing. And no staff has taken any monies belonging to Turkish Airlines. Importantly, no staff had any pecuniary benefit from the so called internet sales. “It is, therefore, disingenuous for the General Manager to hold the workers to the charge of failure to comply with the sales restrictions when it is clear that shortcomings on the part of the Airlines ICT (on the website) combined with Local Management’s decisions on managing an otherwise ugly situation were responsible for the sales in question”, it said. The Union also said it did not agree with the Management’s positions or its findings, adding that “at the so-called disciplinary hearing, the union made it absolutely clear that the committee could only be used as a fact finding means as it was not formed in conformity with the negotiated Conditions of Service.” It added that the coercive actions on the part of the General Manager has seriously and negatively impacted the mental health of all staff of the Airline, causing a number of them to resign without any benefit whatsoever and forfeiting over ten years of service. “We wish to use this medium to inform the general public and relevant stakeholders that the real reason for the sack of the seven out of eleven employees under these trump up charges is the continued determination to exterminate the union from the Airline which it started in 2020 when it sacked all the members of the Airline’s Branch Executive Council of the Union, a matter that it has refused to rectify till date. “Finally, NUATE wishes to state that the high-handedness, plain wickedness and undiluted arrogance of Mr. Lookman Balkan, the General Manager of Turkish Airlines in Lagos makes him totally unfit to hold such important position as to manage people. He has demonstrated total disdain for Nigerians and Nigerian laws – even aviation laws. “On our part, however, NUATE has declared Lookman Balkan persona non grata. We shall instruct all aviation workers not to handle him at any Nigerian airport, except at his exit from Nigeria. And if compelled, NUATE shall internationalise his ostracising from the global aviation family”, it concluded Anthony Awunor, is a business correspondent who holds a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Linguistics (UNILAG).

        "content": "Many of the seedlings that were planted in areas that experienced floods were affected, the Kenya Forest Service has revealed. Chief Conservator of Forest Alex Lemarkoko said seedlings in Samburu county were flooded by water from the heavy rainfall. He, however, said the trees regained life after the rain flood waters receded. Lemarkoko encouraged people take advantage of the rains and plant more trees in support of President William Ruto's vision of achieving 30 per cent tree cover by 2032. \"Forests and areas where rain waters were not stagnating, seedlings survived well,\" he said. Lemarkoko noted that over 150 million trees have been planted this year by KFS and their partners, stakeholders and environmentalists. He spoke at KFS headquarters at Karura on Monday when the service unveiled the revised copies of the Code of Ethics, 2024. Lemarkoko was accompanied by Regional Coordinator for Africa Environment Team Giovanni Borussard and other KFS senior staff. \"We need to do the activities we conduct in the best way. We shall guide our staff,\" he said. The chief conservator said the document will help officers serve with more accountability and transparency. He applauded the KFS staff and workers for the notable decrease in corruption-related cases, attributing it to the collective goodwill of the staff. Lemarkoko further called on the leadership of the KFS to embark on blocking corruption risks, threats of illegal activities and infringement of rights. The CCF also noted that they will continue safeguarding planted seedlings and forest vegetation adding that the newly added staffs have been of great assistance in patrols and surveillance.",

        "content": "Srinagar, May 27: National Board of Accreditation (NBA) granted three-year accreditation extension to two undergraduate engineering programs at National Institute of Technology Srinagar (NIT) Srinagar. As per NBA, two undergraduate courses including UG courses in Electronics & Communication Engineering and Mechanical Engineering have been accredited up to June-2027, in accordance with the ‘Accreditation of Tier I Engineering Institutions under the Washington Accord’. “An expert team conducted evaluation of the programs on 13th April 2024 to verify the data of the programs. The competent authority in NBA has decided accreditation of two programs on the basis of compliance reports for the academic years 2024-2025 to 2026-2027,” it said. In his message, Director NIT Srinagar, Prof. A. Ravinder Nath, congratulated the faculty, staff, and students on this achievement. “NIT Srinagar has a long-standing tradition of excellence, and this milestone reaffirms our position as a premier institution. We are committed to fostering an environment that nurtures innovation and excellence in engineering education,” he added. Director NIT attributed this achievement to the contributions of all faculty members, especially Dr. Gausia Qazi, Head of Electronics & Communication Engineering, Prof. Adnan Qayaom, Head of Mechanical Engineering, Chairman NBA, Prof. Manzoor Ahmad Ahanger, Coordinator Dr. Harveer Singh Pali alongwith their entire team, for their exemplary work. “It was a team effort, and all stakeholders performed their roles professionally,” he added. Institute’s Registrar, Prof. Atikur Rahman said that NBA accreditation serves as a hallmark of excellence, signifying that our institution upholds superior standards in both infrastructure and faculty expertise. “It opens doors to a plethora of opportunities for our students and faculty alike, ensuring that they are well-prepared to excel in their chosen careers and contribute meaningfully to the advancement of knowledge in their respective fields,” he said. NBA Accreditation implies that the Higher Education Institution has high-quality infrastructure and teachers. It provides better recognition from organizations for employment and research purposes. Graduating from a Tier 1 NBA Accredited program increases the chance of placements and acceptance in the higher education institutions around the globe many-folds. According to NBA, the purpose of the accreditation is to promote and recognize excellence in technical education in colleges and universities – at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. They also benefit from the process of continuous quality improvement that is encouraged by the NBA’s developmental approach to promote excellence in technical education. “It supports and advises technical institutions in the maintenance and enhancement of their quality of provision,” it added.",

        "content": "Photo: The Canadian Press Alberta's police watchdog says there will be no criminal charges for two police officers who broke rules when they surveilled NDP legislature member Shannon Phillips. Phillips speaks as Rachel Notley looks on at an announcement in Calgary, Monday, March 15, 2021. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntosh Alberta's police watchdog says there will be no criminal charges for two police officers who broke rules when they surveilled a legislature member. The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team says there are reasonable grounds to believe two Lethbridge police officers committed offences when they did a criminal record check on local New Democrat MLA Shannon Phillips. But it says the Alberta Prosecution Service determined the circumstances didn't meet its test to go to court. The information is contained in a letter from the agency to the politician's lawyer, Michael Bates. The issue began in 2017, when an officer overheard Phillips discussing environmental issues in a coffee shop. He texted a fellow officer and the two subsequently searched Phillips in police databases and photographed and followed her. The two officers received temporary demotions.",

        "content": "The estranged wife of Nigerian singer, Harrysong, Alexer Peres has hit hard on the singer following his infidelity allegations against her. had earlier reported that Harrysong claimed that his wife, Alexer, was unfaithful in their marriage and got pregnant for another man despite marrying her due to emotional blackmail. He also claimed that he regrets marrying into his wife’s family, claiming that infidelity runs in their family as her mother, who has been married to seven men, still cheats. Reacting to the development, Peres took to her Instagram page to debunk Harrysong’s claims, stating that her mother only remarried once after the death of her father. She also challenged the singer to come forward with evidence that she cheated on him. She went on to claim that it is Harrysong’s mum who has six children out of wedlock for six different men. Speaking further, she claimed that Harrysong was a product of incest and he bedwets. On her Instagram account, she wrote: “Do you all know that Harrysong bed wets?

This week: The impacts of climate misinformation and disinformation campaigns have never been more present. Between late April and early May, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil’s southernmost state, was hit by unprecedented floods. More than 70 percent of the state’s almost 500 municipalities were affected, and nearly 70,000 people are still in temporary shelters. In addition to the natural impacts of the tragedy, authorities, volunteers, and the population are having to deal with a wave of disinformation and misinformation campaigns on social media. State of play. In the first weeks of the tragedy, several false reports claimed that bureaucracy was holding up food, water, and clothing donations. Most came from civilians in or near the flooded areas (the majority of them supporters of the former president in one way or another) and right-wing social influencers. Yes, but ... Elected officials also spread some of them, as is the case with Congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of former President Jair Bolsonaro and a representative of Steve Bannon’s far-far-right movement in Brazil.

        "content": "Coronation Street fans have made their feelings clear - as Lauren Bolton's murderer was finally 'revealed'. The ITV soap is airing a very special week of episodes to coincide with the Britain's Got Talent semi-finals as we finally learn what happened to Lauren Bolton on the night she disappeared. The police, led by DS Swain, are convinced she is dead after finding a blood stained leg of a chair in her flat, but is that what happened, or is she still alive? The soap has been teasing a huge week for the show, as Roy's hell in prison comes to a nasty head whilst Nathan Curtis finds himself firmly on the radar for Lauren's disappearance and murder, when Sarah tries to get involved. This week, soap fans will watch on as the first four episodes will show the same day through different character's eyes, and the truth of what really happened to Lauren will be revealed. Tonight, the story focused around Sarah and her desperation to help her daughter Bethany be rid of her evil abuser Nathan for good - but what lengths will she go to to get him locked up? Is Nathan to blame for what happened to Lauren? ( Image: ITV) Speaking about the huge scenes, executive Producer Iain MacLeod, shared: \"This week is so gripping and unlike anything Coronation Street has done before, in terms of the story-telling. It’s modern, really exciting and has some of our favourite characters right in the middle of the drama. The murder mystery around Lauren has had us all on the edge of our seats and the race against time across this week to solve it before Roy gets seriously hurt is so engrossing and cleverly plotted. It is also the launchpad for a massive new chapter in that narrative - so you really won’t want to miss it, if you want to carry on trying to piece together this thrilling puzzle!\" Taking to social media tonight, fans gave their thoughts on the big scenes - as they underwent a huge format change for the special week of episodes when all is set to be revealed about Lauren's shock disappearance and death. \"Why is the colour weird ? Is it a dream? #corrie ,\" one wrote on Twitter, whilst a second added: \"s there some weird filter going on here #corrie .\" A third penned: \"That intro gives me the chills omfg #corrie ,\" with a fourth adding on Twitter: \"Don’t think I like this camera work ! #Corrie .\" A fifth wrote: \"This is rivalling Hollyoaks with this level of cinematography #corrie .\" * Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .",

It would be recalled that the relationship between Justin Dean and his ex-wife, Korra is a topic of frequent social media conversations. Following his divorce from his wife, a series of accusations have been flying around on the internet from both ends. New Telegraph recalls that a few weeks earlier, Dean accused Korra of adultery, saying that she had cheated on him when their daughter was still a pregnant woman. Justin Dean claims that Korra went to Nigeria for a friend’s wedding and cheated on her fiancé while there. Shortly after the birth of their second child, in March 2022, the couple’s marriage came to an official halt. In a new development, Justin Dean came to Facebook to consider the previous two years of his life online as the most trolled. Their public arguments and allegations against one another throughout their separation have garnered a lot of attention on social media. See his post below;",

        "content": "Ganderbal, May 27: In a concerted effort to ensure the smooth conduct of Shri Amarnath Ji Yatra (SANJY) 2024 via Baltal route, the Deputy Commissioner (DC) Ganderbal, Shyambir today visited Baltal and convened a comprehensive meeting with key officers. During the meeting, an in-depth discussion was held regarding the progress of works pertaining to various departments, including Jal Shakti, KPDCL, I&FC, RDD and other departments. The meeting was attended by SSP Ganderbal, Sandeep Gupta; ADDC Ganderbal, Mushtaq Ahmad Simnani; SDM Kangan, Executive Engineers of various engineering wings, and other district and sectoral officers. The concerned departments briefed the DC on the status of ongoing works and assured timely completion of all tasks. The DC emphasized the importance of completing essential works on a war footing basis, including repairing damaged water pipelines, power cabling, toilet facilities, fencing of the pony stand, flood protection works, and parking areas. Shyambir issued clear instructions to department heads to ensure that all preparations are completed within fixed timelines, guaranteeing the provision of the best possible services to the pilgrims. Earlier, the DC, accompanied by the SSP and other officers, conducted an inspection of the yatra track from Domail to the Holy Cave. He provided necessary instructions to the Beacon authorities for the timely completion of all related works, including the development of the track, railing/wire meshing, snow clearance, protection works, illumination of track and other essential tasks. This proactive approach underscores the administration’s commitment to facilitating a seamless and safe pilgrimage experience for all devotees participating in SANJY-2024.",

        "content": "ENG vs PAK 3rd T20I Final Match Free Live Streaming: When, Where and How To Watch England vs Pakistan 3rd T20I Live Telecast On Mobile APPS, TV And Laptop? Check Details. Anticipation builds as England and Pakistan gear up for their third encounter in the four-match T20I series at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff on Tuesday (May 28). The first match was canceled due to adverse weather, but England dominated the second, securing a 23-run victory. Both teams view this match as crucial for fine-tuning their strategies ahead of the T20 World Cup 2024, set to captivate audiences in the USA and the West Indies. Sophia Gardens has hosted 10 T20I matches, with a trend favoring teams bowling first, which have won seven times compared to three wins for teams batting first. The average first innings score is 145, while the second innings average is 138. Notable records at this venue include the highest total of 207/3 by South Africa against England and the lowest total of 89 by Pakistan against England. The highest successful chase is 175/3 by England against Pakistan, and the lowest score defended is 182/5 by England against Australia. The pitch at Sophia Gardens offers lively pace and bounce initially, benefiting fast bowlers. As the match progresses, the pitch becomes more batting-friendly, although spinners gain some advantage in the second innings as it dries out. Teams frequently opt to bat first upon winning the toss due to these conditions. Tuesday’s weather forecast for Cardiff poses a challenge, with a 90% chance of rain, temperatures around 17°C, high humidity at 89%, and winds reaching up to 26 kmph. These conditions could disrupt play and create a damp, clammy atmosphere, potentially impacting the match dynamics significantly.

        "content": "The recent event organised by the Ceylon Motor Traders Association (CMTA), themed “Mobility and Economic Growth,” brought together key stakeholders and thought leaders to delve into crucial discussions shaping Sri Lanka’s economic landscape. The event, highlighted by a keynote speech from Embassy of Japan Deputy Head of Mission Katsuki Kotaro and a dynamic panel discussion, provided invaluable insights and strategies for sustainable growth and enhanced mobility. Kotaro emphasised Sri Lanka’s significant strides in economic recovery since the challenges of 2022. He explained that Sri Lanka’s economy has rebounded since 2022, with steady growth rates approaching the 3% target for 2024. Inflation, previously at 70%, has dropped to 2.5%, though prices remain high. Government efforts and IMF support have stabilised the economy. He went on to explain, that Sri Lanka’s practical strategy should involve starting with hybrid vehicles until about 2030, then transitioning gradually to EVs and fuel cell vehicles by 2035, mirroring Japan’s carbon neutrality goals. This phased approach acknowledges Sri Lanka’s current infrastructure and fiscal limitations. It’s crucial to develop industrial policies that support automobile production and enhance mobility while balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability. The keynote speech was followed by an engaging panel discussion, moderated by CMTA Immediate Past Chairman Yasendra Amerasinghe. The esteemed panel consisted of Ministry of Education Secretary Thilaka Jayasundara, Ministry of Transport and Highways Secretary Eng. Ranjith Rubasinghe, and Sri Lanka Banks’ Association Chairman Bingumal Thewarathanthri. Topics ranged from Japan’s perspective on Sri Lanka’s recovery to fiscal measures impacting industries and upcoming initiatives for improved mobility and transportation and more. During the course of discussion, Thewarathanthri, spoke about Sri Lanka’s current economic trajectory, and possible risks the country might face. He explained: “We don’t see a risk of not crossing this review. As a country, we’ve made significant progress in several areas, including fiscal policy and the external sector, which has performed exceptionally well. Although there are still areas that need improvement, particularly in debt restructuring, the requirement is to show meaningful progress rather than completion for the second review. Given our advancements, I’m confident that Sri Lanka will secure the $ 300 billion needed to move forward.” Thilaka Jayasundara addressed the gathering about the development of industry from an educational standpoint. She explained: “From an educational perspective, as industries develop, we must focus on enhancing our skilled manpower to meet their needs. The Ministry of Education, with the support of vocational training programs, is dedicated to developing skills for emerging industries such as automobile and component manufacturing. We’ve established a Sector Advisory Council to ensure that our training aligns with industry requirements. By the end of this year, we plan to have all our courses in the automobile sector tailored to meet industrial demands, ensuring that our workforce is well-prepared to support these key industries.” Ranjith Rubasinghe, shared his thoughts on the current state of the transportation and mobility sector. He stated: “Our transportation industry is not operating at its highest efficiency. We need to address fundamental issues before adopting new trends like e-mobility. Our focus is on establishing a green energy network before moving to e-mobility. The National Land Transport Policy is in process, and we aim to finalise it soon to guide industry decisions. We’ve also developed an e-mobility policy with expert input, which is crucial for our future plans. Many of our systems are self-grown and need external interventions to become efficient.”",

        "content": ": At least six people have died in West Bengal after Cyclone Remal made landfall in the Sundarbans delta between Sagar Island of South 24 Parganas and Khepupara in Bangladesh on Sunday night and brought heavy rains that destroyed properties and crops in the plains of the eastern state. Most of the deaths were due to electrocution. Two among them, Phorey Singh and his young son Tarun, were from Memari in Burdwan East. They came in contact with a live wire while removing an uprooted banana tree after the cyclone and died. At Panihati in North 24 Parganas, Gopal Burman (47) lost his life after he touched an electric wire that was illegally routed from a pole to a shop but got snapped and was lying on the road. At Maheshtala in South 24 Parganas, a woman, Tapasi Das (53), was electrocuted after she stepped onto a live wire lying in a waterlogged road. Meanwhile another woman, Renuka Mondal (80), died at Mousuni Island in South 24 Parganas after a tree fell on her house. At Entally in central Kolkata, a man, Mohammad Sajid (51), died after a concrete chunk got dislodged from the balcony of a house and fell on him. In Kolkata, a nightlong downpour left many roads from North to South either waterlogged or blocked by uprooted trees. This led to cancellation of the Lok Sabha election campaign rallies of many ruling and Opposition party leaders for the second day, ahead of the final phase of polls on June 1. The rain is likely to continue Tuesday, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to lead a roadshow in Kolkata North parliamentary constituency in support of BJP candidate Tapas Roy after addressing a rally in Barasat in North 24 Parganas. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee posted on X: “West Bengal is a riverine state, on the coast of the Bay of Bengal. So we have to face various natural disasters every year. This time also, massive damage has occurred and is taking place in our state due to the impact of Cyclone Remale.” She said: “But human life comes above everything. Fortunately and certainly due to the steps of the state administration, the loss of life this time is relatively less. I extend my heartfelt condolences to the families of the deceased. Financial assistance will be reached to their loved ones immediately.” The CM said: “The administration will now look into the distribution of compensation for the damage to crops and houses as per the law and we will consider these issues more seriously once the model code of conduct ends. Our administration was prepared this time at all levels for disaster management despite the business of election arrangement.” She added: “From the chief secretary to the entire secretariat of my state to the district administration to the block administration -- all unitedly stand by the people and will continue to do so in disaster management in future. Our municipalities panchayats also have the credit of moving two lakh people to 1,400 camps in safe places. For this, I express my sincere thanks to all in the state and local administration. I firmly believe that with the cooperation of all we shall overcome this storm too. I know you are worried over this disaster. We are worried also. But don't be afraid, don't worry. We will do everything necessary to deal with the situation.”",

        "content": "ABUJA – A Federal High Court Abuja, presided over by Justice Inyang Ekwo, has fixed May 29, for the trial of the detained leader of the Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, Bello Bodejo, Justice Ekwo slated the date after dismissing the defendant’s application for bail. After the court had fixed the date for beginning of trial, Bodejo’s counsel, Dr Ahmed Raji, SAN, said his client is ready for trial, stressing that since the court has ordered accelerated hearing of the matter, there would be no need to appeal the ruling on his bail for now. Recall that the Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore leader was arrested by the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) over an allegation that he unlawfully established an ethnic militia group, Kungiya Zaman Lafiya to promote terrorism. He has been in the custody of the Defence Intelligence Agency in Abuja. He was arraigned in March 2024, on a three-count charge filed by the office of the Attorney General of the Federation, wherein he was accused of breaching the Terrorism (Prevention and Prohibition) Act, 2022. Before the court ruled on the bail application, Dr Raji, had pleaded with the court to admit Bodejo to bail on various grounds ranging from ill health to fundamental rights. He asked the court for “an order admitting the defendant to bail on liberal terms pending the hearing and determination of the charges preferred against him.” Raji had based his application for bail on the ground that Bodejo “suffers from grave ill-health and that the offences are bailable. Contrary to the claims of the FG, Raji told the court that launching of the group by his client was done in a public place with Police Commissioner and personnel of other security agencies as well as Nasarawa State government officials present. He cited Section 36 of the Nigerian constitution, saying his client is presumed innocent until proven guilty. Raji had posited that the charge against Bodejo did not disclose any crime against him.",

        "content": "Brussels, May 27 (AP) Relations between the European Union and Israel took a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid suggesting sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israeli Foreign Minister Katz told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. At the same time, the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, a Spaniard, threw his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including the leaders of Hamas. “The prosecutor of the court has been strongly intimidated and accused of antisemitism,” Borrell said. “The word antisemitic, it’s too heavy. It’s too important.” Angry words abounded Monday, with Katz accusing Spain of “rewarding terror” by recognising a Palestinian state, and saying that “the days of the Inquisition are over.” He referred to the infamous Spanish institution started in the 15th century to maintain Roman Catholic orthodoxy that forced Jews and Muslims to flee, convert to Catholicism or, in some instances, face death. “No one will force us to convert our religion or threaten our existence – those who harm us, we will harm in return,” said Katz. Even though the EU and its member nations have been steadfast in condemning the Oct 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage, the bloc has been equally critical of Israel’s ensuing offensive that has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The latest attacks have centred on Rafah, where Palestinian health workers said Israeli airstrikes killed at least 35 people Sunday, hit tents for displaced people and left “numerous” others trapped in flaming debris. The UN’s top court, the International Court of Justice, on Friday demanded that Israel immediately halt its offensive on Rafah, even if it stopped short of ordering a cease-fire for the Gaza enclave. “Israel has to stop its offensive in Rafah,” Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares said. Spain, Ireland and non-EU member Norway plan to make official their recognition of a Palestinian state on Tuesday. Their joint announcement last week triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries’ ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Israeli Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the Oct 7 Hamas attack and kidnapping. Albares criticised the treatment of the ambassadors. “We reject something that is not within diplomatic courtesy and the customs of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,” he said. “But at the same time we have also agreed that we are not going to fall into any provocation that distances us from our goal,” he added. “Our aim is to recognise the state of Palestine tomorrow, make all possible efforts to achieve a permanent cease-fire as soon as possible and also, in the end, to achieve that definitive peace.” (AP)",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Overcame Stutter to Become Emmy Winning Broadcaster Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” A ‘Deadhead’ With a Zest for Life And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach.",

        "content": "VIENNA — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran’s attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to have economic sanctions imposed over the country’s controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing the program down. The program — as all matters of state in Iran — are , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and that likely won’t change in the wake of last week’s helicopter crash that killed Iran’s president and foreign minister. The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency also comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Israel and Iran have carried out direct strikes on each other’s territory for the first time last month. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said that as of May 11, Iran has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since . Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Also as of May 11, the report says Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6,201.3 kilograms (1,3671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1,489.8 pounds) since the IAEA’s previous report. IAEA’s definition says that around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further, to 90%. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but , has previously warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the U.N. agency cannot guarantee that none of . Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. Under the original nuclear deal, struck in 2015, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. The 2015 deal saw Tehran agree to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for generating nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At the time, U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. Monday’s report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar IAEA inspectors from further monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.” According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran’s decision to bar inspectors — and a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.” The deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA’s talks with Tehran over improving cooperation, the report acknowledged. Before the May 19 helicopter crash, Iran had agreed to hold technical negotiations with IAEA on May 20, following a visit by Grossi earlier in the month. But those meetings fell apart due to the crash. Iran then sent a letter on May 21, saying its nuclear team wants to continue discussions in Tehran “on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon,” the report said. The report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA’s years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. It said the IAEA’s request need to be resolved, otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations” under a safeguards agreement between Tehran and the nuclear watchdog. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA said that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.”",

        "content": "OTTAWA — A new report finds that Canadians feel both \"optimism and concern\" over the prospect of flying cars and drones whizzing between remote communities and above city blocks. The Léger study commissioned by Transport Canada says residents hold a broadly positive attitude toward so-called advanced air mobility, which refers to both drones and electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft — drones' larger, human-piloted cousins. The survey found that despite limited knowledge of the futuristic transport mode, respondents liked advanced air mobility's potential for search and rescue, firefighting, medical use and other critical services. However, the study says concerns over safety, affordability, environmental impacts and privacy tempered enthusiasm for aerial vehicles.

        "description": "Armacost, a retired Air Force brigadier general, spoke during the VFW’s Memorial Day ceremony, which occurred as another one was canceled due to the weather.",
        "content": "GRAND FORKS – Memorial Day isn’t just about remembering military personnel who have died, but also to acknowledge the unseen scars that tours of duty can leave behind, UND President and and retired Air Force Brigadier Gen. Andrew Armacost said during his speech at the VFW’s Memorial Day Ceremony. As an example, Armacost told the story of UND alumnus Sgt. Brandt Bennett, who served in Afghanistan. “In his retirement speech, he focused all his attention not on himself, but on his six platoon-mates who had survived the war, but came home only to not survive the mental and behavioral trauma that existed,” Armacost said. “Each of those six took their own lives and so today, Brandt’s example and the recognition he gave to his six comrades is indicative of the attention we pay on Memorial Day.” Monday's ceremony occurred at the Gregory J. Norman Funeral Chapel at the Norman Funeral Home, adjacent to the Memorial Park South Cemetery in south Grand Forks. It was was hosted by the VFW Post 1874, DAV Chapter 2 and Auxiliaries. The crowd was large — so large they ran out of programs. An event earlier in the day hosted by American Legion Post 6 at the Memorial Park North Cemetery was canceled due to rainy weather. The master of ceremonies was Robert Beauchamp, with music by Michael Marcotte, who sang renditions of the \"Star Spangled Banner\" and \"America the Beautiful.\" The event began with a prayer from DAV Chaplain Robert Howard calling for not only the remembrance of those who have died but also those who struggle “in body and in mind because of what they have experienced.” ADVERTISEMENT Armacost was the keynote speaker and recounted his time working at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. Armacost was in the Air Force for 30 years and spent two decades working at the academy before becoming president of UND in 2020. “Nearly four years ago I arrived here in Grand Forks to serve as the president at the University of North Dakota, and people had asked what the connection between the two?” Armacost said. “When I look at UND, I look at the leaders that we create, the wonder students, the sense of hard work and commitment, that sense of service, and there’s no better example than the four ROTC cadets that we see as part of our honor guard today.” He also thanked the many support groups for veterans in Grand Forks. He noted how the groups help veterans transition and navigate the world, and paperwork, after their time served. “You do so much for the Grand Forks community and all veterans,” Armacost said. “On days like today where we memorialize those who have left us, I also want to acknowledge the DAV national and VFW national organization. ... I know I personally benefited from the support and guidance from members of the DAV and VFW.” UND has nearly 1,500 people on campus who are veterans, dependents of veterans, ROTC members or on active duty, according to Armacost. Armacost said UND will be dedicating new veterans' memorials this Veterans Day. One will be near Columbia Road and Second Avenue North to remember World War I veterans. It will replace the memorial at the demolished Memorial Stadium. Another will be in the new Memorial Union to honor the UND community membrers who have died in wars dating back to World War I. Armacost closed his speech by saying Memorial Day is there to keep memories alive. \"Days like today cause us to reflect upon the meaning of all their service and the memories brought into our lives and Memorial Day is a day to say you are not forgotten and your loved ones are not forgotten, either,” said Armacost. Taps was then played, just after a rifle salute. ADVERTISEMENT U.S. Sen. John Hoeven, R-North Dakota, said in a statement sent to the media that Memorial Day is a time to remember the North Dakotans who died serving in the military. “We can never fully repay our veterans for their dedicated service, but there are many ways we can work to honor their sacrifices and those of their families and loved ones,” he said. “We have secured and continue to work to secure investments in our outstanding state and federal veterans cemeteries, that come as part of our broader efforts to ensure veterans receive the health care, benefits and recognition they have earned.” Gov. Doug Burgum also issued a statement. “On Memorial Day – and every day – we are eternally grateful for those brave and selfless Americans who dedicated their lives to defending our country and our freedoms, securing peace through strength. We must never forget or take for granted these fallen heroes who fought and died for the liberty we enjoy today as United States citizens,” Burgum said. “We also pay tribute and reaffirm our commitment to the veterans of the U.S. armed forces who need our ongoing support, the men and women in uniform defending our nation and freedoms at home and abroad, and the Gold Star families still enduring the loss of loved ones.” And U.S. Rep. Michelle Fischbach, R-Minnesota, said \"to all those who have lost a loved one in service to this country, know that their commitment and courage inspire countless people across this nation. And to those of you currently serving, thank you for standing in defense of America's freedom. The citizens of this country are forever grateful.\"",

Taking to social media, the woman confessed she found the ring and wasn't too pleased with what she saw, since she'd already discussed what kinds of rings she'd like with her husband-to-be. 2 The woman admitted she found the pricey ring and instantly hated it Credit: Getty 2 The ring was the total opposite of what she wanted Credit: Getty \"I found my engagement ring. I hate it,\" she said. She explained that when they first started talking about tying the knot she told him she would never want anything worth over £500, since wearing something so pricey would stress her out. The woman said she even recommended that her boyfriend should get the ring from Etsy, to help keep costs low. But much to her surprise, he ignored their chat and forked out £8,000 on the bling from a posh jeweller. But the disappointment didn't end there for the woman, who said he even got the style of the ring totally wrong. \"I like yellow gold. As in I ONLY wear yellow gold. All of my jewellery is yellow gold,\" she said. But the posh ring she found was platinum. The stone wasn't to her taste either, since she had her heart set on a colourless stone, and not even necessarily a diamond.

        "description": "Soaring plains temperatures have driven millions to overcrowded hill stations in Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh, causing massive traffic jams and environmental strain.",
        "content": "Soaring plains temperatures have driven millions to overcrowded hill stations in Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh, causing massive traffic jams and environmental strain. Usually, the hill stations of North India remain pleasant from March to the end of May. However, these months have alternated between severe cold and scorching heat this year. In 2024, the spring season was essentially lost between winter and summer. The number of tourists and locals in Kashmir has far exceeded its capacity. The increasing number of concrete buildings to accommodate them and the huge crowd of vehicles have disrupted nature, resulting in variable weather conditions. Kashmir, which has always been a top choice for tourists, is now disappointing them due to uncertain weather conditions. March and April, which mark the beginning of spring, had unexpected snowfall, rain, and severe cold until the third week of April. Suddenly, it became scorching hot with temperatures 5-7 degrees above normal. April was the coldest month in the last 20 years, and now May is the hottest month in the last 35 years. In recent years, whenever temperatures in the plains have soared and there has been no respite from the scorching sun, millions of tourists have flocked to the hill stations of Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh. This has led to massive traffic jams and tourist footfall far beyond the capacity of these ecologically sensitive areas. Experts say this can irreversibly damage the fragile ecosystem of these areas. The same is happening with Kashmir, where famous hill stations like Gulmarg, Pahalgam, Sonmarg, and many other places are overcrowded. The rapid construction of hotels, huts, and resorts is leading to the felling of green trees for new developments. As a result, the scorching heat in Kashmir has made life miserable. The Director of the Kashmir Meteorology Department said there will be no respite from the heatwave in Jammu and Kashmir for at least the next 15 days. He further stated that the region is facing variable weather, with sudden heat and heavy rains, and these conditions will increase. He noted that humans will have to adapt to this variability, which is largely due to large-scale urbanization. Mukhtar Ahmed, Director of the Kashmir Meteorology Department, said that the temperature in Jammu and Kashmir has been dry for the last few weeks, and the heat is continuously increasing. Even in the hilly areas, the mercury has risen to 30 degrees Celsius. In the hilly areas of Jammu, temperatures are around 35 degrees, and in the plains of Jammu, they have reached 43 degrees. The heat is expected to continue in the coming days. He added, \"Of course, the uncontrolled temperature of the Earth is increasing globally, and this is true for Jammu and Kashmir as well. Rapid urbanization is contributing to higher daytime temperatures. Our infrastructure, urbanization, massive transportation, and increased factory activities all impact the temperature. Infrastructure development at tourist spots, and increased tourism in recent years, also contribute to rising temperatures.\" The number of tourists in Kashmir has increased by 200 percent in the last five years. COVID-19 restrictions have changed people's mindsets, making them more willing to spend money on domestic travel. They are prioritizing domestic travel over international travel. Air travel to Kashmir is more expensive than to Delhi-Dubai, yet people choose Kashmir. Tourists now spend large amounts on domestic travel, a trend not seen earlier, and they visit Kashmir even in the off-season. Last year, Jammu and Kashmir received the highest number of tourists since independence, with 21.1 million tourists, including pilgrims. There was a 700 percent increase in foreign tourists in the valley. In 2024, more than 1.1 million tourists have reached Kashmir so far, excluding pilgrims to Mata Vaishno Devi. Eight more flights are operating compared to last year, with an average of 18,000 tourists arriving in Kashmir daily, and more than 5,000 arriving by road. According to available data, Kashmir has 100 percent occupancy until July. The sharp rise in tourism is not limited to Kashmir alone. Tourist places in North India like Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Shimla, Manali, Mussoorie, Nainital, and Dalhousie are also packed with tourists. The increasing rush from the plains to the mountains has further aggravated environmental problems, such as damage to the fragile hill ecosystem, plastic pollution, air pollution, unpredictable traffic jams, and the construction of new concrete buildings to host tourists. Many in the tourism industry are concerned about these changes and want Kashmir to become a sustainable tourist destination for future generations. They warn that if the current trend continues unchecked, it will destroy the glory of Kashmir. Manzoor Pakhtoon, General Secretary of the Kashmir Houseboat Association, said, \"Kashmir is a famous place in summers. It is hot during the day, but not unbearably so. Our virgin destinations are crowded with tourists. We should take care of them. Whether it is the government or the common man, we should see how we can make it a sustainable place and save our wetlands and glaciers.\" Pakhtoon added, \"When it comes to the environment, it is not just about tourism. We also live here and need to take good care of our forests and mountains. A pressure group should be formed to protect the environment and our future. New destinations should be built with an eco-friendly approach, not as concrete jungles. This is just the beginning. If we take care today, maybe things can improve.\" Nowadays, tourists visiting Kashmir already feel the change in its climate and say they did not expect such heat in hill stations like Kashmir. Many compare it with their previous visits and note significant changes. They report heavy traffic jams and widespread pollution as reasons for the change. A tourist, Sharda Jain from Gwalior, said, \"We came to Kashmir for the cold and thought the weather would be pleasant, but we encountered scorching heat. Global warming and a lot of tourist traffic could be reasons.\" A tourist from Mumbai, Ashok, said, \"Globalization is also having a significant impact. Many hotels are being built, affecting the environment. Nature is getting destroyed. It is everyone's responsibility, whether common people or the government, to work for a better future.\" Ashok's daughter, Aayushi, added, \"I visited Kashmir in 2006. The Kashmir I saw then is not the same as today. There is much more population, pollution, and crowding. The weather was cold then, but now it is hot.\" A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests that sudden floods, cloudbursts, and intense rains will become more likely in mountainous regions. The report states that rising temperatures and melting glaciers will seriously impact plant and animal species already struggling with heatwaves, droughts, forest fires, and floods. It further states that climate change will cause temperatures to rise in all regions in the coming decades, especially in South Asia. Heatwaves will increase, the hot season will become longer, and the cold season shorter. Mukhtar Ahmad, Director of the Kashmir Meteorology Department, said, \"This temperature increase is what we call variable climate. It is going to increase over time. For every 1-degree increase in temperature, the moisture-holding capacity of the air increases by around 7 percent. This will result in sudden heavy rains and prolonged dry weather. We must be prepared for this variability.\" A climate scientist from Kashmir University said that the current temperatures align with predictions made about climate change impacts. What India is experiencing is due to the warming of the Earth. He warned that the worst is yet to come, saying, \"As the Earth gets hotter, we will see more extreme heat conditions. This year, we have seen hotter weather than ever before. The kind of heat we saw in April-May was expected in June-July.\" Climate experts say that the ever-increasing influx of tourists to the mountains of North India has made the current situation very difficult. A long-term strategy is urgently needed to mitigate the impending disasters of climate change and over-tourism.",

        "content": "BAY VILLAGE, Ohio -- BAYarts is not just a place where art meets beauty; it is a vibrant community anchor, fostering creativity across all ages. Established on the foundation laid by a visionary group of women in 1948, BAYarts has grown into a cornerstone of arts education and cultural engagement in Cleveland’s western suburbs. Now, BAYarts is embarking on a new project that promises to blend artistic expression with the tranquility of nature through the creation of a sensory garden. This garden is designed to be a nurturing retreat for the senses and the spirit, providing a safe, sensory-friendly environment where visitors can enjoy the sights, sounds and smells of nature interwoven with the arts. BAYarts is embarking on a new project that promises to blend artistic expression with the tranquility of nature through the creation of a sensory garden. The initiative will take a significant step forward with the hosting of “A Night in Bloom” June 15, an evening dedicated to raising funds for the garden. The event, set against the picturesque backdrop of the Sullivan Family Gallery at 28795 Lake Road, will offer a blend of fine dining, live entertainment and the thrill of casino games. Nancy Heaton, director of BAYarts, highlights the collaboration with Ground Works Land Design to make the sensory garden a reality. The garden will not only be a place of beauty, but will also serve as a dynamic classroom for art instruction and inclusive programming. Heaton’s vision is reflective of BAYarts’ commitment to community and inclusivity, emphasizing that the garden will be accessible to people of all abilities. The fundraising event will feature heavy appetizers, dinner stations and a variety of drinks, along with a casino room with popular games of chance like blackjack and roulette. A raffle with “amazing prizes” will be drawn toward the evening’s end, providing yet another way for guests to support the garden while potentially winning something special. For those interested in contributing more significantly, BAYarts offers various sponsorship opportunities, appealing to the local business community. The event is adult-only, with a ticket price of $100 per person. Heaton advises securing tickets by June 1, although donations toward the sensory garden will be welcomed beyond this date. The sensory garden is not just an addition to the BAYarts campus, but a new way to experience art, nature and community -- all in one place. For more details on the event or to make a donation, visit the BAYarts’ official or call 440-871-6543.",

        "content": "The Canadian Grief Alliance (CGA) received nearly 4,000 responses on a survey asking Canadians how they are handling grief in their life, highlighting the need for more resources and public education. “A lot of people who are grieving don’t have the kinds of outlets that they might want to talk to other people, to share their experience,” CGA co-chair Paul Adams told Global News. Around 50 per cent of survey respondents said they felt unsupported in their grief and over 80 per cent of respondents also said they would like to be asked about their loss. “There’s a big gap between the way we operate in the world, many of us, and what the people suffering from grief experience,” Adams said. He added that there is a common misconception that sorrow is the main emotion that stems from grief. Story continues below advertisement “Many people feel guilt, they feel angry, they may be irritable or have their appetite affected, sleep affected,” Adams said. “A lot of people seem to think that grief is over within a few weeks or sometimes people think a year is a deadline for grief being over.” The email you need for the day's top news stories from Canada and around the world. Recommendations from the grief survey will be presented to Health Canada in 2025 and Adams said he is hoping for more public education, education for professionals and more resources for counselling services. “People who don’t find adequate support in their family and friends look to other resources and those resources are there and sometimes they are not there,” he said.

Maria Fiala, communications manager for the Canadian Grief Alliance, said she lost her grandmother at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and her grandfather just last year. “There was just a domino effect of losses,” she said. “There was my grandma during that time, my marriage broke down, so that was a huge source of grief.” Story continues below advertisement She noted that unprocessed and unsupported grief can be a precursor to mental illness. “The grief associated with mental health and mental illness is something that’s not really talked about and it can be very significant,” Fiala said. “Mental illness can really rob you of some of your favourite things.” She said supporting someone who is grieving is simple. “What people need is to feel seen, empathy and validation. That’s really it. Don’t try to make it better and don’t try to put a silver lining on it.”",

He is getting solar power to charge mobile phones and power his desktop computer to run the business which has become a lifeline for him and others in the community. Speaking to ARY News, Wahab Tunio said that he had to rely on solar panels to run his business due to the lack of electricity in the locality.

Israeli researchers digging in Jerusalem’s City of David archeological site have uncovered an \"exceedingly well-preserved\" 2,300-year-old gold ring that is believed to have belonged to a boy or girl that lived in the area during the Hellenistic period. The piece of jewelry, which is \"made of gold and set with a red precious stone, apparently a garnet,\" has \"accumulated no rust nor suffered other weathering of time,\" the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) announced Monday. \"I was sifting earth through the screen and suddenly saw something glitter,\" Tehiya Gangate, a City of David excavation team member, said in a statement. \"I immediately yelled, ‘I found a ring, I found a ring!’ Within seconds everyone gathered around me, and there was great excitement.\" \"This is an emotionally moving find, not the kind you find every day,\" she added. \"In truth I always wanted to find gold jewelry, and I am very happy this dream came true – literally a week before I went on maternity leave.\" EXPEDITION TO ‘HOLY GRAIL’ SHIPWRECK FULL OF GOLD, EMERALDS BEGINS IN CARIBBEAN SEA The Israel Antiquities Authority says because of the ring's small diameter, \"researchers estimate that it belonged to a boy or girl who lived in Jerusalem during the Hellenistic period.\" (Israel Antiquities Authority) The Israel Antiquities Authority says the ring was \"recently found in the joint Israel Antiquities Authority-Tel Aviv University excavation in the City of David, part of the Jerusalem Walls National Park, with the support of the Elad Foundation.\" It will be put on display to the public in early June during Jerusalem Day. \"The ring is very small. It would fit a woman’s pinky, or a young girl or boy’s finger,\" the IAA cited Dr. Yiftah Shalev and Riki Zalut Har-Tov, Israel Antiquities Authority Excavation Directors, as saying. Tel Aviv University Professor Yuval Gadot and excavator Efrat Bocher added that, \"The recently found gold ring joins other ornaments of the early Hellenistic period found in the City of David excavations, including the horned-animal earring and the decorated gold bead.\" WOMAN OUT FOR A WALK STUMBLES UPON ONCE IN A DECADE DISCOVERY A researcher poses with the ring after it was found in Jerusalem's City of David. (Israel Antiquities Authority) \"Whereas in the past we found only a few structures and finds from this era, and thus most scholars assumed Jerusalem was then a small town, limited to the top of the southeastern slope (\"City of David\") and with relatively very few resources, these new finds tell a different story: The aggregate of revealed structures now constitute an entire neighborhood,\" they said. \"They attest to both domestic and public buildings, and that the city extended from the hilltop westward. The character of the buildings – and now of course, the gold finds and other discoveries, display the city’s healthy economy and even its elite status. It certainly seems that the city’s residents were open to the widespread Hellenistic style and influences prevalent also in the eastern Mediterranean Basin,\" the researchers added. Those involved with the excavation say the ring helps \"paint a new picture of the nature and stature of Jerusalem’s inhabitants in the Early Hellenistic Period.\" (Israel Antiquities Authority) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The IAA says \"Gold jewelry was well-known in the Hellenistic world, from Alexander the Great’s reign onward\" as \"his conquests helped spread and transport luxury goods and products.\" Greg Norman is a reporter at Fox News Digital.",

        "content": "Two Fundamental Rights Applications against the appointment of “former” High Court Judge Kanishka Wijeratne to the position of Director General (DG) of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), were fixed for support on 19 June 2024 by the Supreme Court last week. A third Fundamental Rights Application against the appointment is also pending. The three Petitions have been filed in public interest, by Energy Expert Dr. M.V.B. Ralapanawe, Transparency International of Sri Lanka and Journalist Ruwani Fonseka, represented respectively by Saliya Pieris, PC, Viran Corea, PC, and Venuke Cooray, AAL. Wijeratne, who was initially appointed as DG of CIABOC in 2020 and was continuing in that capacity was reappointed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe on 2 April 2024, although “reappointment” by itself appears to be a violation of the Anti-Corruption Act, No. 9 of 2023 (ACA), which the self-same President introduced as the “best anti-corruption law in Asia”. One of the Petitioners, in his Petition, moves Court to take cognisance of the “utmost urgency and general and public importance” of the matter since the illegality of the appointment opens every single action by CIABOC to be challenged as ultra-vires and void. The Petitioner argues that CIABOC, the sole law enforcement authority against bribery and corruption in the country, could come to a “standstill”, if the illegality of the appointment is not quickly rectified. There are at least two recent instances in which the appointment of Wijeratne was challenged in matters related to Actions instituted by CIABOC, one even prior to these Fundamental Rights Applications, substantiating the concern raised by the Petitioner. All parties related to the appointment are named as Respondents, including; the Constitutional Council who is required to nominate a fit and proper person in accordance with the ACA and the Constitution, the President who should diligently scrutinise the appropriateness of such nomination and the Commissioners of CIABOC whom the President is required to have consulted with in deciding on the appointment. Wijeratne, whom the Petitioner argues illegally acquiesced to the position of DG-CIABOC, is also named as a Respondent. The Constitutional Council called for Applications for the position of Director General of CIABOC in February 2024. However, the applicants were not interviewed nor informed of any next steps. No information was made available to the public on the evaluation or the selection, although the Constitutional Council’s own Rules require it to do so. Instead, the Constitutional Council has apparently recommended to the President to re-appoint Wijeratne who appears to have also applied to the position while functioning in the same capacity. Section 111 of the ACA defines Corruption as an act done by any public official with the intention or knowledge that a wrongful loss will be caused to the Government or a wrongful benefit will accrue to himself or to any other person, The Petitioner argues that Wijeratne’s actions in applying and accepting the position knowing inter-alia that he did not fit the mandatory criteria stipulated in the new ACA, by itself constitutes “corruption” in terms of the ACA. It is noted that Wijeratne continued in the position throughout the “selection” process which included consultation with the Commissioners, and was in a position to unfairly influence the result as well. This possibly constituted a “Conflict of Interest” (at least the perception thereof), another offence under the ACA. All three Petitioners assert that Wijeratne does not meet at least some of the mandatory criteria stipulated for the position of DG – CIABOC by the new ACA, especially the requirement of substantial experience in criminal prosecution essential to fulfil the duties of the position. It is further contended that a secondment of a Judicial Officer for the position is not permitted by the ACA, which disqualifies Wijeratne as well. According to the 2023 results of the Corruption Perception Index of Transparency International, Sri Lanka has deteriorated remarkably over the last five years, reaching its lowest score in history in 2023. This is coincidentally also the period in which Wijeratne has been functioning as DG of CIABOC. During the same period, a substantial number of cases filed by CIABOC with much fanfare against prominent persons, were either withdrawn by CIABOC itself, or ended with acquittals ostensibly due to technical reasons. These exceed the paltry number which resulted in convictions, and even those are of “minnows” as evident from CIABOC’s own website. Presumably, the DG of CIABOC would be responsible to ensure the accuracy and compliance of the documents, before filing a Case in Court; especially as he in that capacity is the Complainant. If not, not only the action against bribery and corruption (minuscule as it may be when it comes to CIABOC) would be compromised, but also result in gross wastage of judicial resources and time, both of which have occurred under his watch. The level of inaction (voluntary or otherwise) is further reflected in the fact that those Cases are yet to be refiled after correcting the technical errors. None of the “eminent” persons involved in the selection process could plead ignorance of these facts which are in the public domain, and even discussed in the Parliament. The question then is, why the Constitutional Council nominated the self-same individual to be appointed as the Director General of CIABOC again, and the CIABOC Commissioners and the President acquiesced to it, ostensibly even going against the specific provisions in the ACA and “in blatant violation of the Constitution itself”, as argued by the Petitioners? Could it be that despite the public postulations to the contrary, even these paragons of virtue in fact do not intend to take any action against bribery and corruption, lest it affects their current or future benefits? Ineffective counter-action to widespread corruption was one of the reasons giving impetus to “Aragalaya”, culminating in deposing an elected President. Even the IMF recognised corruption as a primary cause of the economic crisis, reflected in “reducing corruption vulnerabilities” being set as a key pillar of the recovery programme for Sri Lanka. The fact that it was the first time in Asia that anti-corruption measures have been linked to an IMF program demonstrates the position Sri Lanka has fallen to in this sphere. The Governance Diagnostic Assessment (GDA) of the IMF (again a first in Asia) delivered an uncharacteristically scathing and candid verdict on Sri Lanka. One paragraph in its Executive Summary gives the situation in a nutshell: “The GDA revealed systematic and severe governance weaknesses and corruption vulnerabilities across state functions, with particular macroeconomic impact in: budget credibility; expenditure control; public investment management and control of spending; public procurement; management and oversight of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs); transparency of revenue policy and the integrity of revenue administration; the governance and legal frameworks of the Central Bank; the application of financial sector regulations; and clarity and security of land ownership and the integrity of the judicial sector. Corruption vulnerabilities are exacerbated by weak accountability institutions, including the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC) that have neither the authority nor competency to successfully fulfil their functions. Current governance arrangements have not established clear standards for permissible official behaviour, acted to deter and sanction transgressions, nor pursued individuals and stolen public funds that have exited the country. Regular civil society participation in oversight and monitoring of government actions is restricted by limited transparency, the lack of platforms for inclusive and participatory governance, and by broad application of counter-terrorism rules.”1 While acknowledging the enactment of the ACA which was one of the initial structural benchmarks of the Extended Fund Facility programme, the GDA went on to emphasise the critical importance of the calibre of individuals selected to lead the CIABOC in order to achieve the objectives of the ACA: “The effectiveness of CIABOC hinges on the selection and appointment of vigorous and dedicated Commissions who have the expertise, experience, and qualities needed to fulfil the organisational mandate. The ACA establishes the Agency as an independent entity. The extent to which it acts as such and serves its ambitious function will be heavily influenced by the manner in which senior CIABOC officials, including the Director General and the Commissioners, are selected and appointed. The selection process for the Director General and the Commissioners must ensure that suitably qualified and experienced candidates are appointed and that the process is free from external interference, whether political or otherwise. There cannot be any question that these processes are fair, above-board, and transparent. A failure to ensure any of this will lead to charges of bias, improper influence and, inevitably, will impair the Commission’s reputation – and crucial public faith and trust in its functions.” The GDA raised concerns that the Constitutional Council, which is required to select and recommend suitable candidates to the President to appoint, did not have the necessary expertise to do so when it comes to CIABOC Commissioners and DG. Thus, the GDA recommended an independent advisory committee to be appointed to assist the Constitutional Council to do this selection. However, the Government seemingly decided to disregard this recommendation; and the IMF seemingly acquiesced despite their own scathing observations in the GDA. And thus, unfortunately for Sri Lanka, the prediction of IMF has come to pass – the failure to appoint suitably qualified and experienced candidates through a fair, above-board and transparent process has inevitably resulted in impairing whatever semblance of reputation and public trust the CIABOC had left. It is yet to be seen how the IMF would treat this misstep by the Government in its next review. The failure of CIABOC affects not only the EFF program, but also the mutual evaluation of Sri Lanka on its international commitments against Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing, due in 2025. Through the new powers given to CIABOC through the ACA, it is now one of the direct law-enforcement agencies on Money Laundering, and thus subject to the full impact of the mutual evaluation. According to the National Risk Assessment on Money Laundering,2 the second highest threat of Money Laundering in Sri Lanka comes from bribery and corruption (second only to drug trafficking). CIABOC’s irregularities and inactions are thus liable to adversely affect the mutual evaluation, and risk Sri Lanka getting into the “Grey List” on Money Laundering again, reversing any progress made on economic recovery. The gravity and importance of transparency and effectiveness of CIABOC for the very existence of the country cannot be lost on the Government and its officers; nor can the Opposition parties, big or small, especially those fielding “Presidential” candidates claim ignorance of this situation. Remarkably, none of the political parties or even the public officers who run to the Supreme Court at the slightest hint of an appointment against their expectations, have even raised a query on this crucial appointment made without any transparency. One can only wonder then, if they were all in collusion. The Supreme Court now remains the only hope of justice to the citizens. 1Sri Lanka: Technical Assistance Report-Governance Diagnostic Assessment (imf.org) 2Financial Intelligence Unit of Sri Lanka - Publications - National Risk Assessment (fiusrilanka.gov.lk)",

        "content": "Technology-based gas distribution company, Smart Gas, in partnership with The Decade of Gas is set to announce the inaugural launch of the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) penetration and sensitization campaign. The event slated for 11:00 am on Tuesday, May 28, 2024, at the Community Town Hall, Zone A, Apo Resettlement, Abuja retains a pivotal role as a pioneering effort in delivering cleaner cooking gas to the less privileged in society in the FCT. Dr Yinka Opeke, CEO of Smart Gas in her words said, “Our partnership with The Decade of Gas is a monumental step towards actualizing a greener future for Nigeria and we are indeed honored to be pioneering this collaboration in the FCT. “By bringing clean cooking solutions closer to the grassroots, we are not only enhancing their quality of life but also advocating for a sustainable environment.” Opeke further highlighted that Smart Gas Ltd feels compelled to advance the LPG penetration in society as an essential component in eliminating energy poverty in Nigerian households, especially the less privileged homes which account for more than 70% of the over 40 million Households, a cleaner energy initiative that would mark a significant step towards achieving Nigeria’s energy transition goals and the Federal Government’s efforts at making gas the transition fuels for today and the future. The event will include giving out LPG cylinders to people in the 6 area councils of the FCT. It will also demonstrate how to use the cylinders safely and explain the benefits of cooking with gas compared to traditional methods. Attendees will also have the opportunity to interact with Smart Gas’s innovative mobile app technology that revolutionizes the conventional methods of purchasing cooking gas amongst other service offerings.",

        "description": "The Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority could fix these problems by halting the fake traffic enforcement.",
        "content": "Southern California drivers who roll through stop signs in mountain parks can receive letters that look like traffic tickets. The citations come from a government agency, demand $100, and threaten penalties for nonpayment. But the notices are not what they seem. The fine print clarifies that the mailed citations are “not issued for any violation of any provision of the California Vehicle Code.” This means people who ignore the lookalike traffic tickets face no legal consequences. The Department of Motor Vehicles will not assess points and insurance companies will not raise rates. The Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, which launched the automated stop sign enforcement program in 2007, can only report scofflaws to debt collection agencies, potentially affecting credit scores. Most vehicle owners pay to avoid the hassle—even if they do not realize the true situation. The agency issues about 17,000 citations annually—nearly 47 per day—using seven cameras in four Los Angeles County parks along the Santa Monica Mountains: Temescal Gateway, Marvin Braude Mulholland Gateway, Top of Topanga, and Franklin Canyon. About 11,000 vehicle owners pay each year, generating $1.1 million in annual revenue. The numbers have been higher in the past. During one 18-month stretch, the agency cranked out 35,000 citations —nearly 64 per day—and pulled in $2 million. Pseudo traffic enforcement can be big business. And nobody can stop it. State lawmakers give the agency permission to collect fines and fees in the California Public Resources Code. And when a California Court of Appeal reviewed the automated enforcement program in 2015, it upheld the scheme. Since then, the agency has posted yellow warning signs, alerting drivers to nearby “video monitoring.” Everything now runs on cruise control. Santa Monica resident Andrew Rice wants to put the brakes on the scheme, which he says is motivated by profit. “It’s set up like a turnstile to generate money,” he told KTLA 5 News. “It’s a money machine for the park.” The Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority disagrees. It insists it only cares about safety, and the seven-figure income it receives from the cameras is just a convenient byproduct. Bloggers and online commenters see through this lie. Setting up cameras to record petty violations is about revenue, they argue. Redflex Traffic Systems, the for-profit vendor that runs the program, exists for no other purpose. And governments around the world are happy to split the proceeds. Once agencies start abusing fines and fees, they often have few restraints. The result can be “taxation by citation,” which occurs when governments use police power to raise revenue rather than solely to protect the public. Research from our public interest law firm, the Institute for Justice, shows hidden costs when agencies give in to this temptation. The first casualty can be goodwill. Residents with recent citations report lower levels of trust in public officials and institutions than residents without, suggesting agencies that use code enforcement for revenue can undermine cooperation in their communities. Hikers who visit Southern California parks might be less inclined to return after receiving a citation in the mail. And they might be less inclined to support park programs. “I’m the kind of person who might have donated money to them,” Rice told KTLA 5 News. “And I never would now.” Related Articles Opinion | California’s legal war on affordable energy Opinion | Biden’s tariffs are another nail in the dollar’s coffin Opinion | Assault weapons bans are only justified if they outweigh the value of freedom Opinion | California’s leaders can’t turn their back on crime survivors Opinion | Honor all who defend our liberties Additional problems surface if vehicle owners try to contest their citations. Not being in the vehicle at the time of the alleged infraction is not a defense. Tickets go to the registered owner, not the driver. People who want a hearing anyway must request it within 21 days and make an advance deposit of the full amount of the citation or get a hardship waiver. If they clear these hurdles, they do not appear before a neutral judge. They face a hearing officer appointed by their accuser. Traditional court rules do not apply. The ranger who issued the ticket does not have to appear. And the video evidence is presumed infallible. Vehicle owners can appeal to state court, but legal costs can quickly outweigh a $100 fine. The Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority could fix these problems by halting the fake traffic enforcement. More broadly, all California agencies should end taxation by citation. Policing should be about safety, not money. Diana Simpson is an attorney and Daryl James is a writer at the Institute for Justice in Arlington, Va.",

        "description": "Walton was a dominant force in college, leading UCLA to two national championships, a two-time NBA champion and a Hall of Famer. He died Monday after a long battle with cancer, the NBA announced.",
        "content": "Two-time NBA champion and NBA Hall of Famer Bill Walton has passed away following a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA announced on Monday. Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke - a former NBA player and now a coach. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career - disrupted by chronic foot injuries - lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. \"One of my guards said, 'Let's try something else,\" Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden's response during that timeout: \"Why? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. \"It's very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA's program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. \"As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It's hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.\" The first overall pick of the 1974 NBA draft by the Portland Trail Blazers, the 6-foot-11 Walton played 10 seasons in the NBA, winning championships with the Blazers (1977) and the Boston Celtics (1986). He averaged a double-double over his career, totaling 6,215 points (13.3 per game), 4,923 rebounds (10.5 per game), 1,034 blocks (2.2 per game) and 1,590 assists. A two-time All-Star, he led the NBA in rebounding and blocks in 1977 and was the league's Sixth Man of the Year in 1986. After his NBA career, Walton turned to broadcasting where he entertained generations of basketball fans. in 2002 as a lead analyst for NBA games before shifting to college basketball in 2012. He was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all-time by the American Sportscasters Association in 2009. Walton was an Emmy winner. \"In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can't talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,\" Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. \"Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It's become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else's biggest nightmare.\" The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a \"Deadhead.\" And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the \"Conference of Champions\" and loved it all the way to the end. \"It doesn't get any better than this,\" he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. \"What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,\" Silver said. \"He was a regular presence at league events - always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" ---",

        "description": "Ant McPartlin looks tired and stressed outside the Britain's Got Talent studios two weeks after welcoming son Wilder with second wife Anne-Marie Corbett",
        "content": "Ant McPartlin has returned to work for the first time since becoming a dad at the age of 48. The TV presenter welcomed his first child with 46-year-old wife Anne-Marie Corbett earlier this month. The couple, who tied the knot in 2021, announced their joyful baby news on Instagram after deciding not to reveal their pregnancy publicly. Fans only knew Anne-Marie was pregnant when she was pictured with a bump. Sharing a sweet black and white photo of Ant holding their newborn son, the proud parents announced their baby's name in the caption of the adorable post as they wrote: \"Welcome to the family. Wilder Patrick McPartlin. Born, 14/05/24 at 8.54am. Baby is beautiful, Mummy’s a legend, Sisters are over the moon. Dad’s a mess.\" And Ant – who had longed to become a father and is said to be \"over the moon\" – has since been enjoying some time off with his family. Pals claimed he is loving being a new dad so much “he’s not even thinking about TV work right now”. But with a busy week of Britain’s Got Talent semi-finals to present, Ant is now back at work and was seen walking into the ITV studios earlier today. Britain's Got Talent fans 'feel sick' as Ant McPartlin issues warning over 'horrible' act Ant looked stressed as he returned to the Britain's Got Talent studios ( Image: JAMES CURLEY AND MAGICMOMENTSUK) Sidekick Dec was seen holding a coffee as it's going to be a busy week on BGT ( Image: JAMES CURLEY AND MAGICMOMENTSUK) After a few days off on paternity leave, Ant looked stressed as he returned to the Britain's Got Talent studios in London for the first of the semi-final live shows, which kick off tonight. Perhaps he hasn't had much sleep lately with a newborn in the house, which is why sidekick Declan Donnelly was on hand with cups of coffee to help get his presenting pal through. And they're going to need the energy as it's one of Ant and Dec's busiest weeks on the telly. They will present all the BGT live shows every night this week, with the final winner being announced on Sunday, June 2. Just a few days ago, Ant and Anne Marie, who has two older daughters from a previous marriage, were pictured taking their young son to a park in South West London in one of his first public outings, with Ant looking every inch the proud dad as he pushed the designer buggy. It is the first time Ant has been back at work since baby Wilder arrived ( Image: JAMES CURLEY AND MAGICMOMENTSUK) Ant and Dec look at scripts ahead of the BGT live shows with the winner being announced on Sunday ( Image: JAMES CURLEY AND MAGICMOMENTSUK) While the pair looked blissfully happy on their family stroll, body language expert Judi James has suggested that first-time father Ant is feeling the pressure and is somewhat anxious on their family day out. The body language guru exclusively told The Mirror : \"Ant pushes this baby buggy with all the intense care and concentration of a man test-driving a brand new top-of-the-range Porsche here. His grip is so firm that his knuckles seem to go white and he gazes down at his new son like a besotted and slightly anxious first-time dad. \"At one point he reaches back with one hand to clasp a much more relaxed and confident-looking Anne-Marie’s hand in his own as though suddenly aware of the responsibility and downright excitement and delight of having two humans and some sweet dogs to look after.\" The expert added: \"With Anne-Marie holding his arm and the two dogs forging ahead, Ant seems keen to show this as an idyllic family unit, gazing into Anne-Marie’s eyes with a tense but wide smile.\" Frankie Bridge fans obsessed with 'amazing' £45 linen River Island dress Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads Do you have a story to sell?

        "content": "Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Monday that India will be governed by Baba Saheb’s Constitution and not Sharia law. “The leaders of the Indi alliance aim to introduce inheritance tax and personal laws, including Sharia law, in India. However, India will be governed by Baba Saheb’s Constitution, not Sharia law. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also affirmed that the country will be ruled solely by the Constitution, and no other regulations will be implemented,” CM Yogi said. He also criticised Congress for manipulating the country’s sentiments. He accused them of attempting to undermine the reservation system for Scheduled Castes and Backward Castes in favor of Muslims, which he firmly opposed. “Today, the spirit of Kashi is resonating throughout the nation. Kashi itself is endorsing the ‘Fir Ek Baar Modi Sarkar’. Today, whatever Kashi thinks, the entire country follows,” he said. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath made these remarks during a public meeting in Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency on Monday, urging the public to ensure Prime Minister Modi’s record-breaking victory. “Kashi, one of the oldest cities in the world, endured 70 years of neglect. However, in the last decade, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Kashi has been transformed. The city’s ancient glory has been restored. The ghats are now bustling with festivity 24×7, whereas they were previously neglected and lifeless,” he said. Taking a dig at the opposition, he said, “The once hazardous tangle of wires in Kashi’s streets has been addressed. Over the past ten years, Prime Minister Modi has changed Kashi’s and the entire nation’s destiny. During the Congress era, the city was frequently targeted by terrorists. When questioned, Congress shamelessly claimed that the terrorists were from across the border. Today, even a minor disturbance in the country prompts Pakistan to issue clarifications preemptively. This change is solely due to Prime Minister Modi’s efforts.” “India has become a powerful nation under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership. The country is witnessing the development of world-class infrastructure, including construction of the largest ropeway in Kashi. By the end of the year, it will connect Cantt station to Baba Vishwanath Dham, enabling one lakh devotees to visit Kashi daily. Kashi is now linked by world-class highways, railways, and an international airport, and a waterway between Varanasi and Haldia has also been established,” CM Yogi added. CM Yogi highlighted, “The dream that Kashi saw 10 years ago has been realized today by PM Modi. Prime Minister Modi initiated the cleanliness campaign from Assi Ghat in Kashi, and today, the ghats are sparkling clean. Previously, cancer patients from Kashi had to travel to Mumbai for treatment, but now the Tata Super Specialty Cancer Hospital from Mumbai is available in Kashi.” While Kashi is setting new development benchmarks, the crackdown on mafia activities continues, making the entire state, including Purvanchal, mafia-free. CM Yogi recalled how mafia members under the SP government had killed BJP MLAs Krishnanand Rai, Umesh Pal, Raju Pal, and Ramesh Patel. He emphasized that the BJP has successfully eliminated these mafias. He also expressed his strong opposition to the Indi Alliance’s proposal for special food and drink facilities for minorities, which could potentially permit beef consumption. He emphasized the cultural significance of the cow in India, where it is revered as a ‘mother’, and has made it clear that such practices will not be allowed. “The people of the country have recognized Congress’s true intentions and are united for ‘Jo Ram Ko Laye Hain, Hum Unko Layenge’. The public has committed to ensuring a victory for the NDA with more than 400 seats, a prospect that unsettles the INDI alliance,” he remarked further",

        "content": "An appraiser working with a bank fled with 2.17 kg of gold ornaments worth `1.44 crore that was mortgaged by customers. The incident came to light when the bank audited its branch at Rajupet of Mangapet mandal in Mulugu district earlier this week. Sub-inspector Ravi Kumar identified the accused as Sammeta Prashanth of Palaigudem of the mandal and a native of Narsampet in Warangal district. During their audit, bank officials found that there was a mismatch between the gold on record and in the vaults. The officials took the issue to the notice of branch manager Kiran Kumar who in turn tried to contact appraiser Prashanth. That is when they learnt that Prashanth along with his family had left the village without informing anyone. The bank officials then lodged a complaint with the police. After registering a case, police found during their investigation that Prashanth had opened a gold shop in Rajupet and had also borrowed money from several persons from the surrounding villages. Police have formed special teams to search and arrest Prashanth. Regional deputy general manager Srinivas Rao of the bank who visited the Rajupet branch to enquire about the theft assured that those who had mortgaged their jewellery need not worry. The bank would return an equal amount of gold or money at market value as preferred by the customers, he said.",

        "content": "A new study shows that hyperandrogenism—a key characteristic of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)—affects immune cell populations in reproductive, metabolic and immunological tissues in a PCOS-like mouse model. These findings are of great importance as it is known that immune dysfunction is an essential part of reproductive complications and metabolic disease, which are very common among women with PCOS. However, as the study shows that hyperandrogenism affects different tissues in unique ways, any possible treatments would have to be carefully tailored to target specific tissue dysfunctions. Since concurrent treatment with an androgen receptor antagonist prevented many changes in the mouse model used in the study, combination therapies that include both anti-androgens and other drugs that target specific altered immune pathways could be explored. The study is published in the journal Advanced Science . One of the most fascinating findings was the clear alterations of immune cells in adipose tissue , despite an unaltered fat mass of the androgen exposed mice. It is well known that immune cells in adipose tissue contribute to insulin resistance in overweight and obese individuals, but here the researchers produced an insulin resistant mouse model that mimics normal weight women with PCOS. The impact of androgens on immune cells in adipose tissue is therefore very interesting considering the high prevalence of insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes among normal weight women with PCOS. Another rather surprising finding was the drastic decrease of eosinophils in the uterus, as these don't express the androgen receptor. This shows that androgens play a broader and more complex role in modulating the immune environment than only through direct androgen receptor activation on immune cells. The next step will be to dissect the underlying mechanisms of the immune alterations, and to assess if these do contribute to the reproductive complications and metabolic comorbidities of PCOS. This will include further characterization of immune cell changes to understand how their function could be affected and link these to reproductive and metabolic mechanisms. The researchers also want to understand how the effect of androgens on eosinophils and mature NK cells is mediated, since neither of them expresses the androgen receptor .

But that might not be the branding that Samsung has settled on – the premium watch might be called “Samsung Galaxy Watch X” instead. That’s not all – the watch will compete head-to-head with the Apple Watch Ultra series (maybe that’s why Samsung wanted to move away from the “Watch7 Ultra” name) and diving will be a key factor. The Galaxy Watch X will reportedly be water resistant up to 100m (330ft), which is the same water resistance rating as the Apple Watch Ultra (and its sequel). Note that water resistance is given as a pressure rating (which is why you sometimes see it measured in atmospheres), the actual depth that you can achieve is lower than that – 40m (130ft) in the case of the Apple watch (and presumably the Samsung watch too). Speculative renders of the Samsung Galaxy Watch7 Ultra/Watch X Anyway, the X is supposed to have better battery life than its siblings, up to 100 hours (which is around 4 days of autonomy). For comparison, the Galaxy Watch6 Classic claims up to 40 hours battery life, the Watch5 Pro (which had a larger battery) claimed up to 80 hours and the Apple Watch Ultra 2 promises 36 hours. Part of that is likely the new and improved Exynos W1000 (which might be Samsung’s first mass-market 3nm chip), but it looks like the Watch X will have a bigger battery too – at least compared to the Classic. South Korean regulators certified a 578mAh battery vs. 425mAh on the Watch6 Classic and 573mAh on the Watch5 Pro (note: these are rated capacities). The Samsung Galaxy Watch X will be unveiled on June 24th (and not July 10 as some early reports claimed), according to TechManiacs.gr , which revealed the “Watch X” name and other details. It won’t be alone, of course, we expect to see the proper launch of the Galaxy Ring and the next generation of foldables too. Source (in Greek)",

        "content": "The Bank of Ghana (BoG) has maintained its Monetary Policy Rate at 29 per cent, citing a slightly elevated inflation profile on account of recent exchange rate pressures and adjustments in transportation fares. However, the Bank said the projections showed that inflation would remain within the monetary policy consultation clause of 13 to 17 per cent at the end of the year. Dr Ernest Addison, Governor of the Central Bank, made the announcement during a press briefing following the Bank’s 118th Monetary Policy Committee meeting in Accra on Monday, May 27. The decision to maintain the policy rate was reached after the Committee deliberated and assessed global and domestic macroeconomic developments for the first four-months of the year, and the balance of risks to the outlook, he said. Dr Addison noted that the interbank weighted average rate remained within the policy corridor, increasing from 28.68 per cent in April 2024 from 25.89 per cent in April 2023. In contrast, the average lending rates of banks declined marginally to 31.25 per cent in April 2024 from 31.66 per cent, recorded in the corresponding period of 2023. “These forecasts are contingent on sustaining the tight monetary policy stance, including aggressive liquidity management operations,” the Central Bank Governor said. Speaking about developments in the banking sector, he said the indicators pointed to a recovery from the impact of the Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP). Total assets increased by 28.8 per cent to GHS306.8 billion at the end of April 2024 driven by domestic currency deposits and other funding sources. Also, banks reported higher profits for the first four months of 2024, relative to the same comparative period in 2023. Regarding gross international reserves, the Governor said the country’s position remained strong, with a US$6.59bn stock of reserve, representing three months of import cover, compared with US$5.91 bn – 2.7 months of import cover at the end-December 2023. Nonetheless, on the country’s fiscal policy, he stated that expenditures outpaced revenue growth in the first quarter, reflecting the frontloading of IPP arrears payments. “Maintaining strict fiscal discipline for the rest of the year will be crucial to strengthen confidence in the economy,” Dr Addison said.",

        "content": "SALT LAKE CITY ( ABC4 ) — The mother of a young southern Utah boy who nearly drowned last week provided another update over the weekend on her son’s condition and the decisions her family will have to make moving forward. Kallie Wright posted to Facebook on Sunday that the days since her son, Levi, was pulled unresponsive from a swift-moving creek have been a “rollercoaster” experience. “We are taking it day by day,” she said in the most recent post. On the evening of May 21, Levi was playing on his toy tractor when he fell into a creek in Beaver County. Emergency crews found the child in the water roughly a mile downstream. Levi, the son of rodeo star Spencer Wright , is currently receiving care at Primary Children’s Hospital in Salt Lake City. Days after the accident, Levi briefly woke up , bringing hope for a recovery. Yet, his mother noted in a follow-up social media post that the child wasn’t fully coherent or talking in that moment, only that he opened his eyes for a short period of time and “wiggled with purpose.” On Friday, an MRI brought more difficult news for the family. Still, Kallie wrote that they were trying to get as many neurologists as possible to view her son’s brain scan. In her most recent post on Sunday, the mother noted that the term “brain injury” is broad, with different ranges and severities, and that recovery varies depending on the specific injury. “We are exploring the therapies that have been mentioned, engaging with those we feel can be of support for us and getting as many professional eyes on this as possible,” Kallie Wright wrote. She added: “We still just need the prayers. We will need them for years to come as I fear we haven’t even reached the hardest part of this.”",

        "content": "The will face some major decisions this summer, as veteran stars , , and could all hit the open market. After struggling with playmaking early in the \"213\" era, Harden and Westbrook have provided the Clippers with two talented lead guards. Last season, Harden averaged 8.5 assists per game, becoming only to hit that single-season milestone. Meanwhile, Westbrook chipped in 5.0 assists per game off the bench. With Kawhi Leonard under contract and limited draft capital, the Clippers are locked into win-now mode. Obviously, keeping Harden and Westbrook would be ideal, as the franchise attempts to contend for the title next season. However, if they lose either player, they will have to find a quality replacement. With limited assets, that could prove to be difficult. According to , the Clippers are expected to show interest in veteran free agents Chris Paul and Kyle Lowry: \"I nonetheless heard this week that Paul and Kyle Lowry, whose free agency is looming after finishing last season in Philadelphia, are veteran guards said to interest the Clippers ... with a further variable to factor in stemming from Russell Westbrook's still-to-be determined status. Westbrook has a $4 million player option for next season that he must decide on by June 29.\" Both players are talented playmakers. In addition, they have plenty of big-game experience, appearing in a combined 285 total playoff games. Can Paul or Lowry Move the Needle for the Clippers? Paul and Lowry are potential future Hall of Famers, but neither player is in their prime. Last season, Paul posted career lows in points per game (9.2), box plus/minus (+1.0), and PER (14.7). Still, he averaged an impressive 6.8 assists per game in a reduced role, while shooting a respectable 37.1 percent from deep. Offensively, he would be a seamless fit in LA. There are concerns on the defensive end. At his peak, Paul was an elite defender, but at this stage of his career, he is no longer an intimidating force. Last season, opponents . Conversely, Westbrook was excellent on the defensive side of the floor for the Clippers last season. He routinely took on the toughest assignments, and his combination of athleticism and energy elevated the unit as a whole. Kyle Lowry vs Chris Paul - 2023 Advanced Stats Category Kyle Lowry Chris Paul ORTG 111.4 113.7 DRTG 111.6 111.0 NRTG -0.2 2.8 Last season, Lowry averaged 8.1 points and 4.2 assists per game. He shot a blistering 39.2 percent from three-point range. Lowry would thrive as a catch-and-shoot option, playing alongside Leonard and George. Like Paul, Lowry is not a great defender. Last season, opponents . Paul and Lowry are quality role players. Given the Clippers' lack of assets, either player would be a quality pickup if Harden or Westbrook departed. They could provide an offensive spark off the bench. However, neither player would significantly boost the team's title odds.",

        "content": "Ahead of Indian freedom fighter and reformer Vinayak Damodar Savarkar’s 141st birth anniversary, actor Randeep Hooda visited the Cellular Jail in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where Savarkar was sentenced to life terms of imprisonment totaling fifty years. Randeep Hooda who played the character of Savarkar in his biopic ‘Swatantrya Veer Savarkar’ shared his deep connection with the role. Speaking to ANI, Randeep said, “After studying Savarkar ji’s entire story and trying to live his life and portray it on screen, I became very involved in it. When people who knew Veer Savarkar, like his family and those close to him, such as the Mangeshkar family, gave me a pat on the back saying that I portrayed him very well, truthfully, and powerfully, it felt great because such validation is often very rare,” he said. “Often, when you make biopics, the close ones of the person say you didn’t include this or show that. But I tried to encapsulate his entire 53-year life in 3 hours. So, it feels like a validation when I receive an award from their side,” he added. The film will premiere on ZEE5 on May 28 to mark the 141st birthday of Veer Savarkar. The movie starred Hooda in his directorial debut. Ankita Lokhande played Yamuna Bai, wife of Savarkar, in the film. Earlier on Sunday, Randeep was recognized with the prestigious Swatantrya Veer Savarkar Award in Mumbai for his portrayal of the freedom fighter in his recent biopic. ‘Swatantrya Veer Savarkar’ is a cinematic portrayal of one of India’s most influential and controversial figures during the Indian Independence struggle, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, revered as Swatantrya Veer Savarkar. The film was released on March 22 in two languages – Hindi and Marathi.",

        "content": "KUWAIT: Ambassador of Tajikistan to Kuwait Zubaydullo Zubaydzoda unveiled a project to export freshwater from Sarez Lake in Tajikistan to Gulf countries and other areas facing water scarcity. This announcement was made during a meeting in collaboration with the United Nations Office in Kuwait, briefing on the current state of affairs of the 3rd High-Level International Conference on the International Decade for Action “Water for Sustainable Development,” 2018-2022. Notably, he mentioned Sarez Lake is an abundant source of freshwater, 61 kilometers long and 500 meters deep. Additionally, he stated that Tajikistan, which accounts for about 60 percent of Central Asia’s water, and has among the lowest electricity tariffs in the region, aims to transmit electricity from the Rogun Hydropower Plant to neighborhood countries once it is completed, such as India, Afghanistan and Pakistan. This plant, which is still under construction, and located on the Vakhsh River, will feature six 600 MW power units with a total capacity of 3,600 MW, making it the most powerful hydroelectric plant in Central Asia. Kuwait exempted from Tajik visa Additionally, the Tajik ambassador said this strong relationship extends to the tourism sector, inviting visitors from Kuwait to explore the beauty of Tajikistan. He highlighted the convenience of travel arrangements, noting that Kuwaiti citizens enjoy visa exemptions, while expatriates in Kuwait can obtain visas at Tajikistan airports, and there is a direct travel route from Kuwait to Tajikistan. Zubaydzoda, who is also the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps in Kuwait, highlighted Kuwait and Tajikistan’s strong commitment to fighting terrorism together in the upcoming International Conference on Combating Terrorism and its Financing, part of the “Dushanbe Process”. Scheduled for November in Kuwait, he stressed the importance of the initiative. “Our bilateral relations with Kuwait are crucial. We aim to strengthen our ties in all areas, especially in politics,” Zubaydzoda said, adding political discussions on this topic between the two countries will take place in Dushanbe in June. Strengthening political ties He discussed the upcoming Water for Sustainable Development conference in Dushanbe, scheduled for June 10-13, 2024. He highlighted its main aim — to boost collective efforts and back the implementation of commitments made in the UN Water Conference’s Water Action Agenda. This involves sharing best practices, fostering partnerships and emphasizing the role of water in sustainable development. The conference seeks to raise awareness and build political support to speed up progress toward achieving the water-related goals of the 2030 Agenda, contributing to the 2024 High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development and the preparatory process of the UN Water Conference in 2026. It will also provide a mechanism to encourage governments, the United Nations and all other partners to translate intentions into actions on the ground and catalyze new commitments to be registered in the Water Action Agenda. “It should be noted that there is almost no region in the world currently that does not experience water issues, and according to the analysis, this issue will become even more complex unless effective collective measures are taken,” added Zubayzoda. Ghada Al-Taher, UN Resident Coordinator to Kuwait, expressed her gratitude to Zubaydzoda for this initiative. “The United Nations values its relationship with Tajikistan and its role in hosting the annual water conference, demonstrating its commitment to elevating water issues,” she said. She stressed the importance of accessing clean water as a fundamental human right, highlighting its pivotal role in sustainable development for all nations. She acknowledged the global challenges in this realm, pointing out that over 2.2 billion individuals endure hardships due to water scarcity, and climate change. Combating water issues Taher noted a growing trend among nations toward ensuring access to safe and clean water, alongside efforts to enhance sanitation services. “The effects of climate change are evident worldwide, leading to droughts or floods, both resulting in significant losses affecting food security and quality of life,” she remarked. She particularly referred to Kuwait, as she highlighted it among the countries affected by climate change. Regarding the UN Office in Kuwait’s support for the Kuwaiti government in elevating water sustainability, Taher mentioned the UN’s role in providing consultations on water provision as an essential human right, which aligns with the UN’s mission in Kuwait, linked to the Sustainable Development Program and Kuwait Vision 2035, stressing cooperation between the two sides within this framework. “Cooperation involves providing consultations to the Kuwaiti government through partnerships with specialized UN programs and organizations, such as the UN Development Program, Human Settlements Program and UN Environment Program. These organizations offer consultation not only on water but also on environmental matters like sandstorms, funded by the Kuwait Development Fund,” Taher highlighted. “Water consumption should be an individual responsibility, not just a governmental concern,” she noted, adding that raising awareness about the serious consequences of water scarcity and promoting the efforts to mitigate its effects due to climate change are essential.",

        "content": "Two players Milind Kumar and Harmeet Singh, who represented the Tripura Ranji team, have been selected in the USA’s squad for the upcoming T20 World Cup 2024 and Joint Secretary of Tripura Cricket Association Jayanta Dey opened up on the players’ performances for the state in the domestic cricket and their rise in the international circuit. As many as two cricketers who have played for the Tripura Ranji team in domestic cricket are now set to play the T20 World Cup as a part of United States international cricket teams while one will play for the Kenya national team. Jayanta Dey told ANI that all three played for the Tripura Ranji team in different seasons. According to Dey, Milind Kumar and Harmeet Singh are going to play for the USA while Tanmay Mishra is in the Kenya squad. Kumar scored 1331 runs in the 2018-19 Ranji Trophy season and then migrated to the USA in search of better opportunities. Both Kumar and Singh had shifted to the USA permanently while Tanmay Mishra has dual citizenship of Kenya and India. As a result, both players Kumar and Singh are eligible to be selected for the USA’s T20I team for the T20 World Cup, which begins on June 2 in the USA and the West Indies. The US will compete against India on June 12. Harmeet played a crucial role in India’s 2012 Australian Under-19 World Cup winning squad. Unmukt Chand, the captain of Harmeet’s team, who has also relocated to the US to play in the Major Cricket League, was unexpectedly left out of the roster, while Corey Anderson, a former all-rounder from New Zealand, was chosen. “Harmeet Singh and Milind Kumar who are now selected in the international side of the USA played for the Tripura Ranji team played for Tripura in different seasons. Harmeet Singh Played for Tripura for two successive seasons starting from 2018-19. Milind Kumar on the other hand played for the Tripura team in 2019-20 and 2020-21. They have shifted to the USA and are now repressing the USA in international cricket. All of them are part of the T20 World Cup team declared by the cricket boards of the respective countries. Harmeet Singh was also part of the Indian under 19 team,” Jayanta Dey told ANI. Dey said that Mishra got the opportunity to play for both countries because his father is Indian and his mother is from Kenya. He also added that the player featured for the Tripura Ranji team in 2019-20. “Mishra’s father is Indian but his mother is from Kenya which is why he got the opportunity to play for both the countries. He debuted in international cricket from Kenya in the year 2006. He played for the Tripura Ranji team in 2019-20. He played in the local league from Sanhati Club and scored more than 1,000 runs in that season. He was then picked up for the Ranji team,” Dey told ANI. Tripura Cricket Association has extended best wishes to the players who got a big break. The ninth edition of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, which will be a 20-team event, will take place in the USA and West Indies from June 1 to 29.

        "description": "The District Court of Noord-Holland handed down convictions against six men who were involved in a series of extremely violent robberies in 2020 and 2021.",
        "content": "The District Court of Noord-Holland handed down convictions against six men who were involved in a series of extremely violent robberies in 2020 and 2021. One person was killed in the violence, and two others suffered life-threatening injuries due to the use of a gun. The harshest sentence was nearly 30 years in prison, and the lowest sentence was closer to four years. The verdict and sentences were read by the court at the Schiphol judicial complex in Haarlemmermeer on Monday. Seven of the robberies took place in Noord-Holland, and the other was in Dreumel, Gelderland. The most severe sentence was given to 31-year-old Glenn V. from Noord-Scharwoude. Prosecutors had called for a life sentence against him, but the court said that was \"not appropriate\" in his case. The court took into consideration that he was not out to kill people, and that he is still relatively young. V., who has a long criminal record, received the maximum prison sentence allowable short of a life sentence. After his imprisonment, he will be placed under supervision due to the risk of recurrence. Just as the Public Prosecution Service did, the court holds him responsible for the violence committed with firearms. According to the court, he shot 72-year-old Sjaak Groot during a robbery in Berkhou. He was also convicted of shooting two victims in the neck and chest during robberies in Avenhorn and Noord-Scharwoude. His co-defendants include Rotterdam resident Ruviëni M., 39, who was handed a 27-year prison sentence. Deniz R., a 28-year-old from Obdam, was ordered to serve 25 years in prison. Mark V., 31 and from Opmeer, was handed 20 years in prison. M. and R. were given sentences slightly lower than what prosecutors demanded, partly because the court did not believe the evidence they were involved in the shootings was strong enough. Mark V. had a permanent role as the crew's driver. The court spoke of a sustained and structured collaboration between the four men, who were also guilty of participation in a criminal organization. The four, previously described by the Public Prosecution Service as a core group, were involved in almost all robberies. Two men who each participated in one home robbery, former Alkmaar resident Dut M. (30) and Martijn G. (28) from Heerhugowaard, received prison sentences of 6.5 years and three years and nine months respectively. The Public Prosecution Service had also demanded that M. spend time in mandatory psychiatric treatment at a TBS facility, but the court did not see justification in imposing the measure. All suspects except M. were present at the verdict reading, in which the court paid separate attention to the enormous impact the robberies had. Many victims still suffer from physical and psychological complaints, and suffer from nightmares and flashbacks. Some have even moved away. With the exception of G., the men have denied or remained silent about involvement in the crimes.",

        "content": "No spectators will be allowed in the stands at FC Utrecht's next home football match in the Eredivisie. Mayor Sharon Dijksma decided to impose the measure in response to rioting by the team's supporters on Sunday when the FC Utrecht was lost out on the chance to play in European football next season. \"I am aware that this is unique, but given the situation last Sunday, this is an appropriate measure. Also, I will not hesitate to disallow an audience at other matches if this situation repeats itself,\" Dijksma wrote on Monday in a letter to the City Council. According to the mayor, FC Utrecht understands the reason for the decision. Additionally, nets must be hung on the sides of the away section in the FC Utrecht stadium. These should prevent them from throwing fireworks and other items back and forth. Dijksma is considering measures against a café near the stadium where a group of rioters are said to have gathered. Just outside the stadium is a slate plateau. Those stones will be removed because the rioters took them from the street to throw as weapons. The municipality wants to recover the costs. FC Utrecht lost to Go Ahead Eagles on Sunday, and therefore did not qualify for the preliminary round of the Conference League. There was unrest in the stadium during the match, and riots broke out outside afterwards. According to the mayor, Utrecht supporters threw a variety of objects at riot police, like \"large rocks, manhole covers, gutters, bicycles, fireworks and all the material that was available on the street.\" Two people from the Utrecht region have been arrested. One officer ended up in a hospital after losing consciousness, according to Dijksma. The mayor says she met with officers on Sunday. \"The pressure on our officers has been enormous for weeks and the sum of the physical and verbal violence they constantly have to deal with is taking a very heavy toll on them.\" Dijksma has therefore appealed for calm. \"It is really essential to find calmer waters together, because this situation is no longer sustainable. We can no longer sustain this together.\" It is not yet known when FC Utrecht will play its first home match and who the opponent will be. The first round of the Eredivisie will take place on August 9, 10 and 11, with the second round a week later.",

        "content": "The Financial Market Authority (AFM) received over 20 percent more reports and questions about fraud and scams in the first quarter of this year. The regulator has also noticed that scammers find new ways to take people's money. The AFM now wants to use a website to better educate the Dutch about how fraudsters and scammers work. The AFM receives reports via the Financial Markets Complaint Desk. This often involves investment fraud, where people are tricked into investing money. Fraudsters also place fake advertisements that look like Dutch celebrities are giving investment advice. According to the AFM, the hotline has also recently received signals about new scamming methods. These include fraudsters posing as AFM employees and scamming their victims again. Due to the increasing number of reports, the supervisory authority has set up the website . There, Dutch people can learn more about the different types of fraud and how they can protect themselves against them. They can also check whether a company they are contacting is known to the AFM.",

        "content": "Heinrich Malan extended his role as Ireland’s head coach for two years until mid-2027. The decision to keep him in the top spot has been taken with an eye towards the 2027 Cricket World Cup. The focus during Malan’s extended time as the head coach will be to ensure Ireland’s qualification in the marquee tournament that is scheduled to be played in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia. The 43-year-old took charge of the Ireland men’s team in March 2022 on a three-year contract. During his tenure, Ireland managed to qualify for the 2022 and 2024 T20 World Cup. But they missed out on a spot in the 2023 Cricket World Cup in India after suffering defeat in the World Cup qualifiers. Before departing with his team for the T20 World Cup in the West Indies and the USA, Malan expressed his excitement for the coming three years as he aims to develop the Ireland team across all three formats. “I am delighted with the extension as it provides the squad and coaching staff a great deal more certainty as we build upon the foundations we have put in place over the last two years,” Malan said in a statement released by Cricket Ireland. “We are now a three-format squad and – despite our smaller talent pool to draw from compared to other Full Members – we have been gradually building a sustainable structure that ensures we can continue to compete and improve on all three fronts,” he added. Malan talked about his aim to cultivate a better game sense in the team and create an environment where his players can play freely with confidence. “One area I have been keen on developing is our players being able to better read the game situation and then, where they judge it appropriate, to have the freedom and confidence to try and impose their style and instincts on the game. Some of our younger players are literally learning this ability on the job, which means there are days they will fail, but failure is a key part of the learning process,” Malan said. “What we as coaches are looking for is evidence that those unsuccessful experiences are analysed and understood by the player and become part of the experience they can draw upon in future matches. This work has borne fruit in two successful T20 World Cup qualifying campaigns and our recent Test success. But we are all conscious that we’ve missed out on playing in the last two 50-over world cups, and qualification for the 2027 tournament will be one of the focus areas across the next three years,” added Malan.

        "content": "New Delhi: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday conducted multi-state raids and arrested five persons allegedly involved in international human trafficking and cyber fraud syndicate. The accused were luring Indian youths to foreign countries on false promises of employment, an official statement said. The youths were being forced to work in fake call centres at Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone (SEZ), Laos and Cambodia, among other places, as part of the racket, controlled and operated mainly by foreign nationals, it said. They were coerced into undertaking illegal activities online, such as credit card fraud, investments in cryptocurrency using fake applications, honey trapping, etc., the probe agency said. Manish Hingu of Vadodara, Pahlad Singh of Gopalganj, Nabialam Ray of southwest Delhi, Balwant Kataria of Gurugram and Sartaj Singh of Chandigarh were arrested following a crackdown at 15 locations in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Chandigarh, it said. The NIA carried out a coordinated operation with state police forces and central intelligence agencies across all the locations. The searches led to the seizure of several incriminating materials including documents, digital devices, handwritten registers, multiple passports and bogus overseas employment letters, among others. Eight fresh FIRs have been registered by different state/UT police forces and five accused have been arrested, the NIA said. Investigations have further revealed that the arrested accused were coordinating with traffickers operating from across the international border to facilitate illegal border-crossing of Indian youths from Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam to Laos SEZ, it said. They were working at the behest of foreign-based agents belonging to well organised syndicates that were active in several districts of Maharashtra, UP, Bihar, Gujarat, Delhi, Punjab and Haryana among others, the NIA said. “These syndicates were further connected to operatives based in other parts of India, as well as foreign countries like the UAE, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos SEZ, etc.,” it added. The searches and subsequent arrest are part of the NIA probe in a case it took over from the Mumbai Police on May 13. It found that the human trafficking syndicate was not operating merely in Mumbai but had linkages with other facilitators and traffickers in various parts of the country and across the border, the probe agency said. The NIA investigations have revealed that the accused were involved in an organised trafficking syndicate engaged in luring and trafficking Indian youths to foreign countries on the false promises of employment.",

        "description": "The family-friendly pizza restaurant has had its first major refurbishment since opening in 1994, adding a new ice cream and churro bar.",
        "content": "I introduced the third generation of the family to Di Maggio’s East Kilbride when we took the kids for dinner at the revamped restaurant. I’m old enough to remember being taken here by my parents when the pizza and pasta restaurant opened here in 1994. The first Di Maggio’s restaurant was established when Mario Gizzi went into partnership with his uncle Giuseppe “Joe” Conetta, opening in 1984 in the West End. Themed around American baseball legend Joe Di Maggio, there was an American Italian menu of pizza, pasta, burgers and ribs. Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with an ad-lite subscription to GlasgowWorld, you get 70% fewer ads while viewing the news that matters to you. It was during the 1990s that Joe’s son, Tony, joined his cousin in the family business. They went on to launch Cafe Andaluz, Amarone and turned Glasgow’s oldest Italian restaurant, La Ariosto, into the Barolo Grill. The group now has 19 restaurants of various hues and plans for expansion. What's the Story? The East Kilbride restaurant has had a major reimagining, kitted out with a churro bar and gelateria, Churissimo. Tony Conetta said: “We’ve been serving the community of East Kilbride for more than 30 years and this is a huge moment in our history in the town. A tremendous amount of love and care has gone into the refurbishment, and we’re sure the introduction of EK’s first authentic churro bar will go down a treat. “We love being a part of East Kilbride, we’ve welcomed thousands of families through our doors, and we look forward to thousands more. It’s also about playing a part in bringing new people to the town, and we hope the new-look Di Maggio’s East Kilbride and Churissimo will achieve that for the next 30 years.” On the Menu Churros and ice cream If you grew up in and around Glasgow then you are probably familiar with Di Maggio’s Glaswegian approximation of a New York pizza. What’s new here is the steady supply of freshly made churros - there’s bite sized portions for the kits, churros dusted with sugar and cinnamon for the adults or filled with white chocolate, Nutella or salted caramel. Advertisement Advertisement Dips include Belgian chocolate or biscoff bueno flavour. There’s 12 ice cream flavours like chocolate fudge brownie, strawberry cheesecake or raspberry ripple. It’s a modern take on the classic Italian cafe with some Iberian sweet treats on top, a nod to the group’s success with Spanish tapas at Cafe Andaluz. Atmosphere There’s space for 220 customers here, it’s a big dining room but there’s plenty of space between tables which helps when wee ones are going back and forth to the compact soft play area tucked away in the corner. The renovation has created a smart space with plenty of tables and booths to suit different sizes of parties, some allusions to art deco and vintage prints on the wall. We went early on a Thursday night and the place was busy with other families and couples meeting up after work. Verdict Our seven-year-old, an expert on pizza Margherita was impressed with his cheese-laden main course which disappeared quickly. It was really a prelude to the main event and he gave a 10/10 review for the chocolate fudge brownie ice cream topped with mini marshmallows and churros bites with Nutella dipping sauce that we shared. Our toddler chewed on chunks of garlic bread and ate individual bits of macaroni cheese before trying a couple of spoonfuls of ice cream. Battered fish goujons, grilled chicken with mashed potato and spaghetti with tomato sauce are popular on the kids menu. Advertisement Advertisement After starters of bruschetta and mozzarella cubes, I had pepperoni pizza that reminded me of takeaways from here in my student days. It’s comfort food that arrives promptly, a quality that’s treasured when dining out with the whole family. My wife had pizza diavola with melted mozzarella, red chilli and smoked paprika chicken fillets. I hadn’t been back since I moved away from East Kilbride 20 years ago, not for any reason other than there were more convenient options when I lived in Dublin, Edinburgh, Dennistoun and Partick. The revamped restaurant has the added attraction of the dessert bar and has been kitted out to continue to cater to the next generation of EK families. It will continue to be a local favourite.",

        "content": "The Sensex crossed 76,000 mark for the first time and Nifty-50 also went past 23,100 mark in tandem led by rally in frontline stocks but in the last hour of trading benchmark indices fell sharply on profit taking. BSE’s benchmark index had hit the 75,000 mark last month on April 9. After climbing to 76,009 intra-day, the Sensex closed at 75,390.5 down by 19.89 points or 0.03 per cent. The Nifty-50 index too made a new all time high of 23,110.8 but closed lower at 22,932.45 down by 24.65 points or 0.11 per cent. Foreign portfolio investors were net sellers of equities worth Rs.541.22 crore while domestic institutions were net buyers by Rs.922.60 crore. “The bulls are facing stiff resistance at 23,000 levels as investors start booking profit at higher levels to avoid any knee jerk reaction in the market ahead of the election result. Better earnings growth, the expectation of a revival in private capex, and a moderation in FIIs selling intensity are the key positive triggers in the market,” said Vinod Nair, head-Research, Geojit Financial Services. Broader market closed mixed as the BSE Mid-cap index gained 0.63 per cent while the BSE Small-cap index closed flat losing 0.09 per cent. Volatility index NSE’s India VIX climbed 6.82 per cent to 23.19 and made a high of 26.20 intra-day which seem to have led to caution among the market participants. BSE’s IT (0.48 per cent), bank (0.63 per cent) and realty (0.76 per cent) sector indices gained while metal (-0.39 per cent) and power (0.49 per cent) were losers while all other sectoral indices closed flat. Stronger rupee at 83.13 per US dollar and Brent crude oil futures also in $81-82 per barrel range are providing strength to the Indian market as the selling by the foreign portfolio investors have moderated. Further Indian Meteoro-logical Department’s May 27 update on Monsoon rains said, “Quantitative-ly, the southwest monsoon seasonal rainfall over the country as a whole is likely to be above normal rainfall.” Market is likely to cheer IMD update despite election outcome related short term volatility that is likely to prevail till June 4 this year.",

        "content": "We believe you can eat well without breaking the bank. In each Meals, Deals and Steals column, we’ll explore the happiest happy hours, the most delicious daily deals and cheap eats and drinks across the region. Big Sam’s is a small, rambling shack of a building that has old-school charm and flavors. Inside, the dining area is split into two, one allowing seating to watch over the cooking on the grill, and the other in a room with wrap-around windows opening up onto the surrounding water. It’s a comforting feel throughout, with fish house vibes. Tucked between boat slips and other restaurants in Rudee Inlet at the south end of the resort area, the delicious offerings here are seafood-centric and the drinks made strong at breakfast, lunch and dinner. Many menu items are a value here at Sam Caldow’s venerable eatery, but during Tiki Time, offered from 3 to 7 p.m. every day, the deals and steals shine. ___ During Tiki Time, four food items are highlighted in addition to specials on domestic beer, select imported bottled beer, and well drinks with either soda or juice. We decided to try several bivalve offerings: a half-dozen raw clams, priced at 99 cents each; a half-dozen steamed clams, priced at 99 cents each; and a half-dozen raw oysters (you can also get them steamed), priced at $1.59 each. We also selected a half-pound large steamed shrimp, priced at $9.99, and a half-dozen wings, priced at $1.49 each. The bivalves were impeccably fresh. The steamed clams were slightly chewy and tasty, and the raw clams were sweet with just a hint of salt. The oysters, too, were sweet, plump and flavorful with a fresh taste of ocean. A dozen shrimp came out to about a half-pound, and each were very large and steamed perfectly. The natural sweetness came through, with a bit of seasoning from the shells present, adding to their appeal. Wings at Big Sam’s are among my favorites anywhere. Get them double grilled, and you will be rewarded with crisp, flavorful wings that give way to meaty, tender flesh underneath. My husband and I shared all the dishes, and we were very pleased not just with the flavor, but with how satisfied we were after we cleaned our plates. We wanted to try a little of everything, but you could pick and choose what pleases your palates. For cocktails, we ordered vodka with grapefruit juice, a classic, and priced nice at $4.89. ___ We all love to splurge a little, and during our visit, we ordered an item off the specials menu. Hatteras-style clam chowder is lovely, with clams, potatoes and other vegetables in a highly-seasoned broth. It’s delicious and restorative, and we started our meal with a cup, priced at $4.99. Big Sam’s is at 300 Winston Salem Ave., Virginia Beach. Call 757-428-4858 or visit www.bigsamsrawbar.com . Patrick@VirginiaEatsAndDrinks.com",
