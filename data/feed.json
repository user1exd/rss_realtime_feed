I entrust this diocese to the intercession of Our Lady of Guadalupe, patroness of the Americas, and invoke God's blessing upon all the faithful,” Rojas said.California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) chimed in on the move, stating First Amendment rights were being attacked under the Trump administration.“Freedom of religion? Not in Donald Trump’s America.

Randy Fine must apologize immediately.\" Fine, who was elected in an April special election to succeed Mike Waltz after his short-lived appointment as national security adviser, posted Tuesday night on X in response to a post from Omar that lumped Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu in with \"war criminals.\" \"I'm sure it is difficult to see us welcome the killer of so many of your fellow Muslim terrorists,\" he wrote. \"The only shame is that you serve in Congress.\" Omar is one of the first two Muslim women in Congress and has been a harsh critic of the Israeli government.

Greg Abbott announced Wednesday the state Legislature will focus on redistricting during a special session later this year, as Republicans look to defend their narrow House majority in 2026. The move could potentially reshape the state’s congressional map — which already heavily favors Republicans. President Donald Trump’s allies have encouraged Texas Republicans to redraw the state’s maps to create more House districts that favor Republicans ahead of next year’s midterms. POLITICO previously reported that members of the Texas delegation to Congress were wary about a potential redraw. “This is a political play fraught with tons of land mines that the Texas Leg[islature] and governor would never do but for requests from outside,” one Texas GOP lawmaker, granted anonymity to discuss the dynamics, told POLITICO last month. A bid to make some blue or blue-leaning seats more GOP-leaning would necessitate moving Republican-leaning voters out of safer red districts. In wave years, those now less-red seats could become vulnerable to a Democratic pickup — which is sometimes known as a “dummymander,\" a play on gerrymandering. Texas is currently facing a lawsuit over the congressional maps the state drew in 2021 after claims that the maps underrepresented nonwhite Texas voters. The Department of Justice originally filed the lawsuit during the Biden administration but withdrew from the challenge after Trump returned to office.",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — The New York Yankees have designated two-time batting champion DJ LeMahieu for assignment, one day after manager Aaron Boone had said the aging infielder with a diminished defensive range would primarily be used off the bench.The Yankees, who owe LeMahieu about $22 million on the remainder of a six-year deal that ran through the 2026 season, made the announcement before Wednesday night’s game against the Seattle Mariners.LeMahieu, who turns 37 on Sunday and has dealt with a variety of toe, foot and hip injuries, was hitting .266 with two homers, 12 RBIs and a .674 OPS this season. He won his first batting title in 2016 with Colorado and his second with New York in 2020, when he hit .364 with 10 homers and 27 RBIs in 50 games during the pandemic-shortened season.The decision to designate him for assignment comes after Boone announced that All-Star infielder Jazz Chisholm Jr. would move back to second base, where LeMahieu had made all 35 of his starts this season. Boone acknowledged that Chisholm, who has been hampered by a sore shoulder, had been struggling with making the longer throws from third base.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",

Now they are tied for having the most All-Stars, too.Zach McKinstry was picked Wednesday to replace Astros shortstop Jeremy Peña, who has been dealing with a rib injury. The infielder-outfielder will join Detroit second baseman Gleyber Torres and outfielders Javier Báez and Riley Greene — all AL starters — and staff ace Tarik Skubal, who also is among the candidates to start the All-Star Game on Tuesday night in Atlanta.Meanwhile, Houston third baseman Isaac Paredes was picked Wednesday to replace the Guardians’ José Ramírez, who had been the starting third baseman. That gives the Astros four All-Stars in Peña and pitchers Hunter Brown and Josh Hader.The Guardians said Ramírez wanted “to focus on recovery and preparation for the second half of the season.”The five All-Stars for Detroit is tied for the most with the World Series champion Dodgers, who have DH Shohei Ohtani, catcher Will Smith and first baseman Freddie Freeman starting for the NL along with pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto.Yamamoto is scheduled to start Sunday for Los Angeles, so Reds left-hander Andrew Abbott has been picked to replace him.McKinstry and Paredes make four total replacements and 69 players between the two All-Star teams. The other substitution was Rays third baseman Junior Caminero for Boston's Alex Bregman, who has been dealing with a strained right quadriceps.The Tigers have been one of the surprise stories of the first half of the season....",

Die Attrappen mit schwarzer Hautfarbe wurden mit orangen Leuchtwesten bekleidet und sitzen in einem Boot, das auf einen großen Holzturm gesetzt wurde, der beim traditionellen Lagerfeuer zum protestantischen Siegestag am 12.

Er begründete dies am Mittwoch in einem Brief an die Führung in Brasilia mit dem Vorgehen der brasilianischen Justiz gegen den früheren Präsidenten Jair Bolsonaro sowie mit der angeblichen \"Zensur\" von US-Onlineplattformen in dem Land. Die US-Importzölle auf brasilianische Produkte sollen demnach am 1. August in Kraft treten.Der Prozess gegen Bolsonaro sei eine \"Hexenjagd, die sofort enden\" müsse, kritisierte Trump in dem Schreiben an Brasiliens Präsident Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, das er in seinem Onlinedienst Truth Social veröffentlichte. Trump hatte der brasilianischen Justiz bereits in den vergangenen Tagen einen \"Angriff auf einen politischen Gegner\" vorgeworfen.Der 70-jährige Rechtsaußen-Politiker Bolsonaro muss sich in seinem Heimatland wegen eines mutmaßlichen Putschversuchs verantworten. Am 1. Januar 2023 hatten Bolsonaro-Anhänger in der Hauptstadt Brasília den Kongress, den Amtssitz des Präsidenten sowie das Oberste Gericht gestürmt und schwere Verwüstungen angerichtet. Zuvor hatte Bolsonaro, ein erklärter Trump-Anhänger, die Präsidentschaftswahl gegen seinen linksgerichteten Rivalen Lula verloren.Der Fall erinnert an den Sturm von Trump-Anhängern auf den US-Kongress am 6. Januar 2021, nachdem der Rechtspopulist die Präsidentschaftswahl gegen den Demokraten Joe Biden verloren hatte. Bolsonaro selbst weist alle Vorwürfe zurück und plant sein politisches...",

Ford’s massive $3 billion EV battery facility in Marshall, Michigan, meant to power the next generation of affordable electric vehicles, got caught in a political minefield over foreign tech partnerships. But now, thanks to revised language in the latest spending bill, the automaker’s factory is back in Washington’s good graces and eligible for billions in production tax credits.Structural steel is erected less than one year after Ford and SK On announced their $5.6 billion investment to build a revolutionary all-new electric truck and advanced batteries for future Ford and Lincoln vehicles in West Tennessee at BlueOval City. With construction underway at BlueOval City, Ford – America’s No. 2 electric vehicle brand – gets closer to its target of reaching a 2 million electric vehicle annual run rate globally by late 2026. The nearly 6-square-mile mega campus will create approximately 6,000 new jobs and is on track to open in 2025. (Photo Courtesy: Ford)Why does this plant matter right now?Ford’s Michigan facility, scheduled to open in 2026, will produce lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells, a cost-effective chemistry aimed at making EVs cheaper to build and own. The plant is already 60% complete and expected to bring 1,700 jobs to a...",

Thanks to low-cost brokerage platforms and fractional investing, putting $100 a week to work on the ASX is easier than ever.Over time, these regular contributions — often referred to as dollar-cost averaging — help smooth out market volatility, build a solid base of investments, and benefit from the power of compounding.If you invest $100 every week (the equivalent of $433 a month) for 20 years and earn an average return of 10% per annum, you could grow your portfolio to almost $315,000! That's without needing to time the market or pick the next big winner.Focus on quality, not hypeWhen building long-term wealth, it is best to focus on quality and not hype. Many of the ASX's most reliable compounders aren't the ones grabbing headlines.Companies like CSL Ltd (ASX: CSL), Wesfarmers Ltd (ASX: WES), and Goodman Group (ASX: GMG) have delivered strong returns for years by doing one thing well — growing earnings consistently.If you prefer a simpler approach, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) such as the Vanguard Australian Shares Index...",

Confirmation of Eaton’s “right-sizing” has been difficult to attain from company officials, but people who are in touch with Kearney’s manufacturing community and some of Eaton’s leaders shared what they’ve been told. Trevor Lee, president of the Economic Development Corp. for Buffalo County, said the layoffs will constitute a 70% reduction, from 313 employees on the payroll down to 94 employees at the Kearney plant. “That many layoffs really reduces your opportunity for employment,” said a Kearney man employed at Parker Hannefin, a filter manufacturer in Kearney. Lee said the Eaton layoffs are shocking for those directly affected; however, other Kearney companies are hiring right now. The Economic Development Corp. will work with state and local organizations to help laid-off Eaton employees find new jobs.

Trump, on the campaign trail, said he was “inclined” to declassify the entire file. On Monday, however, an unsigned memo from Trump’s Justice Department discredited those claims, saying there’s no evidence that Epstein maintained any such client...",

PSG built a 3-0 lead in 24 minutes, deflating the heavily pro-Madrid crowd. Goncalo Ramos, who subbed on for Dembele early in the second half, added a goal for good measure in the 87th minute. Gianluigi Donnarumma parried one early shot by Mbappe and finished with two saves, but the PSG defense was otherwise unbothered en route to their fifth clean sheet in six tournament matches. Wednesday marked Mbappe's first time facing PSG, for whom he scored 256 goals over seven years before joining Madrid a year ago. After coming on as a substitute the past two matches, Mbappe started up front alongside Gonzalo Garcia, but was held off the scoresheet. Trent Alexander-Arnold was out of Real Madrid's squad, reportedly due to a training injury. PSG's attack wasted no time, forcing Courtois to make two difficult saves during the first five minutes. But in the sixth, Dembele robbed Raul Asencio of the ball in the center of the box, tapped it away from Courtois' diving reach and set up Ruiz for a one-timer into the back of the net. Dembele made Madrid pay again when he closed in on Antonio Rudiger, who proceeded to whiff on a pass attempt in the defensive half. Dembele bolted away and beat Courtois in the bottom left corner for a 2-0 lead less than nine...",

Houser (5-2) won his third straight start. Edgar Quero hit an RBI double and scored in a two-run fourth against Toronto starter Eric Lauer (4-2), and Chicago stopped the Blue Jays one win shy of their franchise record. Toronto has won 11 straight five times, most recently in August 2015. Houser, who gave up one run and seven hits, has a 1.56 ERA through nine starts. The right-hander has allowed two earned runs in 26 innings over four outings at Rate Field. Grant Taylor pitched around a two-out double by Bo Bichette in the eighth, getting Vladimir Guerrero Jr. to ground out. Jordan Leasure struck out the first two batters in the ninth before Alejandro Kirk singled. The right-hander then retired Myles Straw on a fly to center for his second save in five chances, and the White Sox came away with the win after losing nine straight at home against Toronto. Lauer struck out seven in four innings, allowing two runs and four hits. Chicago scored two in the fourth, after Austin Slater led off with a single. Quero drove him in with a one-out double and came around on a single by Lenyn Sosa, giving the White Sox a 2-1 lead. Both teams were 1 for 9 with runners in scoring position.

The Yankees, who owe LeMahieu about $22 million on the remainder of a six-year deal that ran through the 2026 season, made the announcement before Wednesday night's game against the Seattle Mariners. LeMahieu, who turns 37 on Sunday and has dealt with a variety of toe, foot and hip injuries, was hitting .266 with two homers, 12 RBIs and a .674 OPS this season. He won his first batting title in 2016 with Colorado and his second with New York in 2020, when he hit .364 with 10 homers and 27 RBIs in 50 games during the pandemic-shortened season. The decision to designate him for assignment comes after Boone announced that All-Star infielder Jazz Chisholm Jr. would move back to second base , where LeMahieu had made all 35 of his starts this season. Boone acknowledged that Chisholm, who has been hampered by a sore shoulder, had been struggling with making the longer throws from third base. AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",

Novak Djokovic reaches a record 14th Wimbledon semifinal and faces No. 1 Jannik Sinner next LONDON (AP) — Novak Djokovic has reached the Wimbledon semifinals for a men’s-record 14th time as he pursues his unprecedented 25th title from all Grand Slam tournaments. Djokovic beat Flavio Cobolli 6-7 (6), 6-2, 7-5, 6-4 on Wednesday to set up a showdown against No. 1 Jannik Sinner for a berth in the final. Sinner eliminated Ben Shelton 7-6 (2), 6-4, 6-4 and didn’t play like someone dealing with an injured right elbow. He used terrific serving and his usual booming forehand to win against Shelton for the sixth consecutive time. Sinner hurt his elbow in a fall during his fourth-round match against Grigor Dimitrov on Monday night.

Clark was 4 of 12 from the field with four turnovers in Indiana's loss to Golden State, which bumped the Fever to 9-10 with four games to go before the All-Star break. \"It felt good to be out there,\" Clark said after logging a season-low 25 minutes. \"The offense -- for us it starts with defense. We struggled. ... Overall, they just played with more energy and effort. Nobody played well today. \"I felt pretty good. Just trying to get my legs under me and get my wind back.\" Clark had 10 points on Wednesday, largely playing without the ball according to the plan of Indiana coach Stephanie White. She started Sydney Colson, who took over at point guard while Clark recovered from her second leg injury of the season. She also missed three weeks with a strained quad. \"I like the ability to have two primary (ball handlers) on the floor,\" White said. \"Being able to give the opponent different looks. Quite frankly, for (Caitlin), especially not having to have her play under duress 94 feet, we'll continue to work on that.\" White is hoping to spare Clark's legs and maximize her 20-plus minutes per game until she regains her health. Whether Clark can get her legs back without another extended absence is the concern. She had a season-low six points with eight turnovers at Seattle when she awkwardly needed to kick off a second extended hiatus from the...",

Real fared no better than Inter Milan, overrun by PSG 5-0 in the Champions League final . The 15-time European champion looked sluggish after traveling to Florida for training between games, and PSG had 76.5% possession in the first half. A crowd of 77,542 was at MetLife Stadium on a scorching day with a temperature of 91 degrees Fahrenheit (33 Celsius) at kickoff and humidity that made it feel like 101 (38).

        "content": "Public confidence that Jeffrey Epstein’s associates will be brought to justice has eroded over the past year-and-a-half, according to new YouGov polling. The survey, conducted July 8-9, also found widespread skepticism with the official government narrative surrounding his death. It comes after President Donald Trump’s Department of Justice wrapped up a lengthy investigation into Epstein, who died in 2019 — in what was ruled a suicide — after he was arrested and charged with sex trafficking minors. In a July memo, the DOJ reported that no Epstein “client list” was found, and no evidence emerged to justify investigating any uncharged third parties. The memo also reaffirmed that Epstein died by suicide in his New York City jail cell. The findings contradict earlier claims by some Trump officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, who told Fox News in February that Epstein’s client list was “sitting on my desk right now to review.” And, in October, then-vice presidential candidate JD Vance said during a podcast interview, “Seriously, we need to release the Epstein list . That is an important thing.” Here is a breakdown of the poll’s findings. The survey — which sampled 7,237 U.S. adults — asked respondents how much confidence they had that “all people connected with Jeffrey Epstein who are alleged to have committed sex crimes will be thoroughly investigated.” Just 15% of respondents said they were very or somewhat confident that investigations would occur, while 67% said...",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Mattel has introduced its first Barbie representing a person with Type 1 diabetes, as part of wider efforts from the toy maker to increase inclusivity among its dolls. In an announcement Tuesday, Mattel said it had partnered with Breakthrough T1D — a Type 1 diabetes research and advocacy organization formerly known as Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, or JDRF — to ensure that the design of the doll “truly captures the community.\" That includes accessories that “accurately reflect the medical equipment\" people with Type 1 diabetes may need, the California-based company noted. “Visibility matters for everyone facing Type 1 diabetes,” Emily Mazreku, director of marketing strategy at Breakthrough T1D, said in an accompanying announcement. And as a mother who lives with Type 1 diabetes, she added, “it means everything to have Barbie helping the world see T1D and the incredible people who live with it.” The new Barbie wears continuous glucose monitor (CGM), a device that tracks blood sugar levels, on her arm — while holding a phone displaying an accompanying app. She also has an insulin pump attached to her waist. And the doll carries a blue purse that can be used to carry other essential supplies or snacks on the go. The Barbie's outfit is blue, too — with polka dots on a matching top and skirt set. Mattel says that this color and design are nods to symbols for diabetes awareness. This new doll “enables more children to see themselves reflected in Barbie,”...",

England revived its title defense following its opening loss to France by earlier Wednesday.

Alice Sombath and newcomer Thiniba Samoura, both 21, formed France women’s youngest ever central-defensive partnership at a major tournament. Mateo, another change, fired the favorites into an early lead with a fine finish after a corner, but Jess Fishlock equalized in the 14th when she prodded the ball inside the right post.

The company initially made the announcement back in June, with a post to its X account, that said “snack wrap 07.10.2025.” To celebrate the Snack Wrap's return, some McDonald's locations are promoting plans to give away free Snack Wraps to the first 100 customers starting at 11 a.m. on Thursday.

According to a CHP media release, officers from the department’s San Bernardino Area station were notified of a possible shooting on the 210 Freeway in San Bernardino on Tuesday afternoon around 2:34 p.m. The officers were told that the victim was a 12-year-old boy who was shot and taken to a hospital with a bullet wound to his leg. “Investigators responded to the hospital and contacted the victim, who had been riding in the rear passenger seat of a silver SUV when an unknown suspect opened fire,” CHP’s release indicates, adding that bullet holes were found in the SUV.As the investigation unfolded, detectives discovered a separate incident involving the brandishing of a firearm that occurred around the same time on the same freeway near the border of San Bernardino and Rialto. A witness to that incident, which occurred on the 210 between Pepper Avenue and State Street, provided CHP with a vehicle description that led them to identify the car as a gray 2010 Honda Civic. The witness also recalled seeing the silver SUV involved in the shooting swerve across lanes and exit at State Street, officials said.Investigators continued their probe into the incidents and were able to locate the suspect vehicle near Victorville with the help of Flock Safety cameras.

James Comer of Kentucky says O’Connor’s refusal to testify makes it “clear there was a conspiracy.” Republicans are probing Biden’s actions in office and questioning whether the Democrat's use of an autopen may have been invalid.

Trump has described Bolsonaro as a friend and hosted the former Brazilian president at his Mar-a-Lago resort when both were in power in 2020.

Those drugs, according to the Orange County District Attorney's Office, ended up in the hands of a 3-year-old relative who was staying at the same short-term rental property as Bird and his wife and children.It's alleged that the boy found and ingested some of the drugs and overdosed on fentanyl, struggling to breathe and turning blue as his frantic parents dialed 911. The boy was taken by ambulance to the Children's Hospital of Orange County and needed to be revived with the emergency anti-overdose drug naloxone, commonly known as Narcan.FILE - A container of Narcan, a brand name version of the opioid overdose-reversal drug naloxone, is shown on Friday, Sept. 8, 2023, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, File)The boy was also suffering from extreme itching, which led to medical crews administering epinephrine in an attempt to stop a potentially deadly allergic reaction. But it wasn't until naloxone was administered that the boy's condition improved, at which point he positively tested for fentanyl.Officers from the Newport Beach Police Department searched the rental property and found a backpack in Bird's room that contained burned foil, a device for...",

Wednesday was his last game for the club before his August move to AC Milan . The Croatian international, sitting next to his longtime friend and teammate Lucas Vazquez, looked like a pained man as Los Blancos quickly fell 2-0 down within the game's opening 10 minutes. Modric sat with his head in his hands, eventually moving them slightly to reveal a man wraught with grief. Modric — featured most commonly the backs of Los Blancos supporters throughout the tournament — entered to a roar of applause from the Real Madrid fans in the 65th minute. The crowd at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, featured almost exclusively fans of the Spanish giants (sans for a pocket of PSG ultras behind one of the goals). Jeers were audible every time the Parisian side dallied on the ball in the second half, or when Madrid winger Vinicius Jr took one too many dribbles without passing in the final third. The 39-year-old is set to join Italian giants AC Milan at the conclusion of the tournament, a move the he hopes will prove to many that he is showing no signs of slowing down. This will mark the end of his 13-year journey with Real Madrid. Though not officially confirmed by Milan, their manager Max Allegri spoke about the player in his first press conference of the...",

The result was a 544-kilogram Nanaimo bar that they claimed was the largest ever made. The group snatched an unofficial record set just weeks earlier, when culinary arts students at Vancouver Island University in Nanaimo, B.C., created a confection weighing just 45 kilograms less. The fudge factory says they received some biting messages from the dessert’s namesake community after announcing the feat. The same group of Ontario kids already holds the current Guinness World Record for the largest Nanaimo bar after they baked a 240-kilogram bar back in 2020. Chantelle Gorham, one of the owners of the fudge factory, says she chose not to go through the process of recording the latest endeavour in the Guinness record books because they want Nanaimo residents to claim it. “We understand that the Nanaimo bar is near and dear to Nanaimo, B.C., and this is something they should be very proud of,” said Gorham, whose kids were part of the Ontario baking team. The Nanaimo students didn’t follow the Guinness verification process either, instead relying on validation through the Baking Association of Canada and the Culinary Association of Canada.

OKLAHOMA CITY — An evaluation by the State Chamber Research Foundation gave the Oklahoma legislature a 73% pro-growth score for the 2025 session. The foundation releases an annual assessment grading lawmakers and legislation on pro-growth and pro- business merits. This year, the chamber took a new approach with the Prosperity Tracker, formerly the RIED Report, an app that tracks the voting of state legislators on measures identified by the research foundation as pro-growth. “This year’s Prosperity Tracker gives companies the opportunity to see how legislators voted on key issues that affect the business community,” said Jake Yunker, executive director of the State Chamber Research Foundation. “This is a great tool to show how legislators are voting as well as an opportunity for companies to engage with those lawmakers to better explain the positions taken by the business community.” Lawmakers are graded according to their vote on bills related to business, industry, job creation and economic growth. The legislature as a whole received a 73% pro-growth score, with seven legislators receiving a perfect score, and forty scoring higher than 90% on the assessment. State Rep. Mike Osburn, R-Edmond, state Rep. Tammy West, R-Oklahoma City, state Sen. Christi Gillespie, R-Broken Arrow,...",

        "content": "A Concord man was arraigned in court on Tuesday on charges of felonious sexual assault, computer uses prohibited and breach of bail. Zaymen Burdette, 19, was out on bail for previous sexual assault and drug dealing charges at the time of his second arrest. Burdette was originally the subject of a multi-month investigation concerning allegations of sexual assault and drug dealing last year. Authorities arrested him in January 2025 on possession of a controlled drug with intent to distribute, certain uses of a computer prohibited, contribution to the delinquency of a minor and three sexual assault charges. He was then released on bail. In March 2025, the Concord Police Department opened another sexual assault investigation that led to new charges against Burdette, including two counts of felonious sexual assault involving a victim aged 13-15, two misdemeanor counts of breach of bail and one felonious use of computer prohibited. Police took him into custody on July 7. After refusing to cooperate with the booking process, Burdette was transferred to the Merrimack County House of Corrections, where he is currently being held on preventative detention following his arraignment.

LaSalle County Coroner Richard Ploch on Wednesday identified the man as Dr. Noel Liu, 48. Ploch's news release said the LaSalle County Coroner's Office had been called to Skydive Chicago early Monday evening for a report of a \"male decedent who had been involved in a skydiving accident.\" An autopsy was conducted Tuesday, but results, including toxicology testing, were still pending Wednesday, the news release said. The incident remains under investigation by the LaSalle County Coroner’s Office and the LaSalle County Sheriff’s Office, with assistance from the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration. Liu is listed as founder and CEO of Secure Dental on the company's website. The dental practice is on Riverside Drive in East Peoria. Liu graduated from the NYU College of Dentistry, according to the website. Fellow Secure Dental founder and CEO Dr. Nazish Jafri shared a statement on the \"Noel Liu, DDS\" page on Facebook on Tuesday afternoon. \"It is with a heavy heart that I share the news of Noel's sudden passing during a skydiving adventure last evening. He lived a life full of fulfillment and satisfaction, always pursuing his passions with enthusiasm and courage,\" she wrote. \"Noel touched the lives of many with his warmth and enthusiasm, leaving behind cherished memories that will be treasured forever.

With the majority of the weighted vote, Shenandoah County, represented by Sheriff Timothy Carter, holds the deciding share. The committee, which includes one representative each from Shenandoah, Page, Rockingham, and Warren counties, met Tuesday night at the Shenandoah County Sheriff’s Office and unanimously agreed to open a call for candidates this week, followed by public interviews on July 29 and a final vote to select the nominee. If all interviews cannot be completed that evening, the meeting will recess and resume on July 31. A formal call for candidates is expected by Friday. Prospective nominees must submit written declarations of candidacy by 5 p.m. on July 18. “This is your role. You have the burden of responsibility,” Committee Chair Vito Gentile told members. “And you have to do it in whatever way enables you to do it in good conscience.” Gentile said the process is not new and has been laid out in the Republican Party of Virginia’s plan for at least 15 years.The party plan directs Legislative District Committees to select a nominee when a certified candidate withdraws after the primary deadline, as occurred when Delegate Todd Gilbert stepped down as the candidate earlier this month following his appointment by President Donald Trump to U.S. Attorney. While each county has one representative, votes are...",

In an era in which the best athletes are encouraged to commit to a single sport in order to master it, the Anacortes High School senior not only played three sports, she dominated in them. She earned second-team all-Northwest Conference honors in volleyball, second-team all-Northwest Conference honors in basketball and placed among the top 10 in two events — the triple jump and shot put — at the Class 2A state track and field meet. Being able to shift gears so quickly from one sport to another can be difficult. Hunt credits her background in competitive dance with her success in sports. “My mom and I talk all the time about how much I think dancing helped me so much coming into multiple sports because it just helps me with so many different things,\" she said. \"Like coordination and flexibility, honestly, and all that kind of stuff. It made moving between different things so much easier.” Hunt did competitive dance from the ages of 8 to 15. She considered hip-hop to be her best style, but also performed tap, ballet, jazz, breakdancing and hula. Dance was a year-round activity for Hunt, running alongside the seasonal sport at the time. She remembers hurrying from track meets straight to dance competitions. She grew accustomed to jumping between sports. Regan Hunt competes in the girls' triple jump in May at Lakewood High School.

        "content": "By most measures, the S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) has had a great year in 2025.For one, the index has recovered from its 2025 lows to hit new all-time highs this year, the most recent of which was the 8,639.1 point high watermark we saw earlier this month.Yesterday, the ASX 200 closed just short of that all-time high at just above 8,538.60 points.For another, we've seen a bevvy of prominent blue chip ASX 200 shares hit new highs of their own. The most famous of these (or perhaps infamous, depending on who you speak to) is, of course, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA).But we've also been multi-year, or record, highs for shares ranging from National Australia Bank Ltd (ASX: NAB) and Coles Group Ltd (ASX: COL) to Telstra Group Ltd (ASX: TLS) and Wesfarmers Ltd (ASX: WES).Today, many of these shares look expensive, and are trading on some of their lowest dividend yields we've seen in a very long time.It's arguably quite difficult to find bargain buys on the ASX today.Even so, I still wouldn't be surprised if the ASX 200 keeps on climbing this year. We could even see the index break 9,000 points for the first time ever.Why? Well, it comes down to one factor – interest rates.At the start of 2025, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) had the cash rate at a 13-year high of 4.35%.However, thanks to a rate cut in February and another in May, the cash rate now sits at 3.85%. Most commentators expected the RBA to go three for three this week. However, to most experts' surprise,...",

Moore’s office announced Tuesday that his constituent services staff in Morgantown and Martinsburg have helped recover more than $2 million from various federal agencies for taxpayers since taking office on Jan. 3. “My office is eager to help constituents of the Second District in dealing with the frustrations of the federal bureaucracy,” said Moore, R-W.Va. “I’m so proud of the work we’re doing and am thrilled to report this massive figure only six months into my term.” The $2 million represents funds owed to constituents in the 2nd Congressional District by federal departments and agencies, such as owed compensation, retroactive payments, pensions and other outstanding payments. Some of the taxpayer funds returned to constituents after being withheld include more than $1 million from the Department of Agriculture, more than $900,000 from the Internal Revenue Service, more than $320,000 from the Social Security Administration, more than $25,000 from the Department of Veterans Affairs, more than $20,000 from the Department of Defense and more than $12,500 from the Office of Personnel Management.

What did you do as a Scout in the 70s in Franklin County? We would love to learn more about this tradition. July 4 1975 It’s barbecue season, and it looks like just about everyone is grabbing something to eat in this week’s photos.

Тигулев признался, что «Мора» стала его первым полнометражным художественным фильмом. «Мы изначально хотели снять ужасы - классический жанровый слэшер, где группа юных ребят едет на отдых и попадает в западню. Зумеры - это просто часть этой формулы. Для Артемия это не дебют в кино. У него уже есть роль в фильме «Я съем твою собаку». С Артемием работалось отлично. На самом деле, как с любым известным и востребованным человеком - все четко по плану, без лишних разговоров и задержек. Он очень приятный человек. Был рад познакомиться с ним при таких обстоятельствах. Не буду раскрывать никаких подробностей его роли - все увидите в фильме», - рассказал режиссер в эфире НСН. Он также поблагодарил Хофманниту за то, что она выдержала физически непростые съемки. «Ей отдельно мой низкий поклон. У нее были физически трудные сцены: очень много бега по лесу в обуви на платформе, падения, ледяная вода. Не обошлось без ссадин и легких травм. Но она все выдержала и выдала перформанс, чем влюбила в себя всю съемочную группу. Думаю, зрители, знакомые с ней, приятно удивятся, увидев ее сцены», - поделился Тигулев. По его словам, точная дата релиза проекта пока неизвестна. «Фильм готов, мы все ждем точных дат премьеры. Предположительно, осенью этого года», - подытожил собеседник.

        "content": "Right after the Wednesday edition of the Herald-Zeitung went to press on Tuesday, it was learned that the remaining family members of Jake and Megan Moeller were announced dead by the floods in Kerr County. Avery’s Kitchen in New Braunfels, where Megan Moeller worked as a server, posted the passing of all family members on its Facebook page, along with a GoFundMe link to help the family carry the weight of the funerals. On the GoFundMe page, which was organized by Megan’s sister, she stated, “On July 4th, our lives changed forever. In the early morning hours, a catastrophic flood in Ingram, Texas took five beloved members of our family, my Mother, DeeAnn, and my Stepfather, Gary, as well as my sister, Megan, her husband, and their young daughter, Harley. The grief is beyond words, and we are still trying to comprehend how to move forward without them. “My Husband and I never imagined having to ask for help like this. But no one expects to wake up and suddenly carry the weight of four funerals. On top of that, we’ve had to take on significant debt to ensure their estates are properly managed and their affairs are handled with the care they deserve. The financial burden is more than we can manage on our own, and we are doing everything we can to honor their lives and say goodbye with the dignity they deserve. “If you are able to support us in any way, please know that every gift will go directly toward these unexpected costs. Most of all, we are deeply grateful for your love,...",

        "content": "Republicans passed the legislation Thursday after Congress pulled two all-nighters to meet Trump’s self-imposed July 4 deadline. A host of provisions were included in the spending package; chief among them were the permanent extension of the 2017 tax cuts, new tax breaks on overtime and tips, a $40,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, and $350 billion in funding for border security and defense. It will also make cuts to multiple social programs, including SNAP and Medicaid. The impact on Medicaid will be particularly significant, with Republican lawmakers cutting roughly $1 trillion from the program over the next decade by instituting more frequent eligibility checks and work requirements, among other policy shifts. The changes are predicted to cause 11.8 million people to lose their health care by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. In Maryland, roughly 246,000 people are expected to lose their coverage. Here’s what to know about the Medicaid changes, who they will affect, and when they’ll be implemented. A chunk of the savings in the Medicaid portion of the bill will be caused by added red tape that states and residents will have to navigate to determine recipient eligibility. The new law requires states to increase the frequency of eligibility checks for Medicaid expansion recipients to once every six months. Under previous law, states were required to check eligibility yearly. The new process won’t be immediately enacted. It will start after Dec....",

Evenepoel, the reigning time trial Olympic and world champion, was expected to win the stage in the absence of time trial specialists — Filippo Ganna and Stefan Bissegger, who both crashed and exited the race on the first day of the Tour last week.

Evenepoel, who has fully recovered from multiple injuries sustained in a big crash last year, was 16 seconds faster than Pogacar. Edoardo Affini, the time trial European champion, was third, 33 seconds off the pace. Tucked on his bike in a perfect aerodynamic position, Evenepoel was in a class of his own. He made the most of the back wind in the second half of the race, reaching the finish at an average speed of more than 54 kph (33.5 mph). \"I didn't really feel like I could go any faster,\" Evenepoel said.

        "content": "CAEN, France — Race-against-the-clock specialist Remco Evenepoel produced a stunning display of power to win the first time trial of the Tour de France on Wednesday and defending champion Tadej Pogacar cemented his favorite status by grabbing the yellow jersey. Evenepoel, the reigning time trial Olympic and world champion, was expected to win the stage in the absence of time trial specialists — Filippo Ganna and Stefan Bissegger, who both crashed and exited the race on the first day of the Tour last week. The mainly flat 33-kilometer (20.5-mile) stage 5 in Normandy favored powerful riders like Evenepoel, who already had won a time trial in a similar fashion last year, when the Belgian rider finished third overall in the general classification. Evenepoel, who has fully recovered from multiple injuries sustained in a big crash last year, was 16 seconds faster than Pogacar. Edoardo Affini, the time trial European champion, was third, 33 seconds off the pace. Tucked on his bike in a perfect aerodynamic position, Evenepoel was in a class of his own. He made the most of the back wind in the second half of the race, reaching the finish at an average speed of more than 54 kph (33.5 mph). \"I didn't really feel like I could go any faster,\" Evenepoel said. But the day's big winner was Pogacar, who was back in the yellow jersey a day after taking his 100th career win. The three-time Tour winner opened a big gap on his main rival Jonas Vingegaard, who endured a bad day and lost more than...",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — While senators are leaving Washington at a higher-than-normal pace, House retirements are lagging behind the historical average. But it’s still early, and second-quarter campaign finance reports, due July 15, could provide a window into departures to come. Thus far, 16 House members have announced they aren’t seeking reelection, but calling it an exodus or referring to all these exits as retirements wouldn’t be accurate. Thirteen of them are running for another office, including seven members who are attempting to move just a few steps across the Capitol to the Senate. The other six are running for governor, including Iowa Republican Randy Feenstra, who’s formed an exploratory committee but hasn’t formally announced a gubernatorial bid. Just three House members — Illinois Democrat Jan Schakowsky, Nebraska Republican Don Bacon and Pennsylvania Democrat Dwight Evans — are leaving at the end of their terms without running for something else. (Note: This list does not include resignations, with Tennessee Republican Mark E. Green expected to step down on July 20.) But whether they’re running for something else or leaving public service altogether, there will be more members who decide against reelection this cycle. Going back 80 years, the average number of House open seats has been 35. Recent lows include 24 seats in 2014 and 25 each in 2012 and 2008. Why are they leaving? Typically, conversations around House retirements and open seats make it seem like members are...",

        "content": "In a break with tradition, King Charles has reportedly decided to scrap a long-standing dress code at Buckingham Palace that has been in place since 1919. The rule, which applied to the Palace's private tennis court, previously required players to wear all-white attire. The tennis court, built in 1919 during the reign of King George V, King Charles's great-grandfather, has been used by both the Royal family and Palace staff. To align with Wimbledon 's traditional dress code, the all-white rule was strictly enforced. However, according to the Sunday Times, King Charles has relaxed this rule, making all-white attire \"preferable\" but no longer \"essential\" for players. The tradition of wearing all-white at Wimbledon, which dates back to Queen Victoria's time, was initially adopted to conceal sweat stains. The Royal family has long been associated with Wimbledon, with several members, including Princess Beatrice, her mother, Sarah, Duchess of York, Sophie, the Duchess of Edinburgh, and Lady Amelia Windsor, the Duke of Kent's granddaughter, attending this year's tournament. The Buckingham Palace court, affectionately known as the Windsor Court, has seen its fair share of tennis greats over the years. English champion Fred Perry once played matches against King George VI, Queen Elizabeth II's father, and Charles III's grandfather, reports the Mirror . In a nostalgic moment in 2000, Björn Borg and John McEnroe recreated their 1980 and 1981 Wimbledon finals in a charity match on the...",

        "content": "Two student pilots were killed Tuesday morning after their planes collided during a training session in southern Canada, officials said. The crash happened near Steinbach, a city in the Canadian province of Manitoba, about 45 miles north of the Minnesota border. “The two pilots were pronounced deceased on the scene, the Manitoba Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said in a news release. “There were no passengers aboard.” Authorities were notified of a midair collision in an area just south of Steinbach shortly before 9 a.m. RCMP, fire crews, and emergency medical services responded to the scene and located the wreckage of two small single-engine aircraft. Adam Penner, president of Harv’s Air pilot training school, said the two students, a man and a woman, were practicing takeoffs and landings. “(The collision) happened when they were on the approach to land. We don’t know exactly how they hit each other yet,” Penner told the Winnipeg Free Press. The identities of the victims have not been officially released. “I don’t have that information,” RCMP Cpl. Melanie Roussel said at a news conference in Winnipeg Tuesday afternoon. “There’s really limited information right now.” However, the family of one victim, Savanna May Royes, identified her in a statement to CBC News, describing the 20-year-old as “the essence of pure joy.” “Savanna’s faith and laughter will forever touch everyone who was lucky enough to have known her, during her short life,” the statement said. ©2025 New...",

The announcement Wednesday shows that personal grudges rather than simple economics are driving the U.S. leader’s use of tariffs. Bolsonaro is charged with trying to overturn his 2022 election loss. Trump has described Bolsonaro as a friend and hosted the former Brazilian president at his Mar-a-Lago resort when both were in power in 2020. Trump wrote in the letter posted on Truth Social that the trial “is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!” Trump's trade blitz produces few deals but lots of uncertainty WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and his advisers promised a lightning round of global trade negotiations with dozens of countries back in April. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro predicted “90 deals in 90 days.’’ Administration officials declared that other countries were desperate to make concessions to avoid the massive tariffs that Trump was threatening to plaster on their products starting July 9. But the 90 days have come and gone. And the tally of trade deals stands at two – one with the United Kingdom and one with Vietnam. Trump has now extended the deadline for negotiations to Aug. 1 and tinkered with his threatened tariffs, adding to global uncertainty. Musk's AI company scrubs inappropriate posts...",

On that day, descendants of Wilhelm and Katherine Peters Francke, German immigrants who came to the U.S. and settled in Nebraska during the 1800s, have gathered for reunions to celebrate their ancestors. The family has met every year except during World War II and briefly during COVID. Last month, nearly 70 Francke descendants marked nine decades of getting together and reminiscing when they met at Prairie Creek Inn east of Lincoln, which once was the homestead of August Francke, one of five sons of Wilhelm and Katherine Francke. \"We are all a part of the fabric of this heritage,\" said Joyce Latrom, a descendant of August Francke's brother Henry, who has attended the family reunions since she was a girl in the 1950s. \"It keeps us all tied together.\" Today's family descends from the five brothers, but most of the attendees trace their family roots back to Albert and August Francke. The family reunions have always taken place in Nebraska. When Latrom was a kid, the reunion was held at Antelope Park. For the past 15 years, the reunion has been held at Prairie Creek near 148th and Van Dorn streets, a bed-and-breakfast run by Bruce and Maureen Stahr, who moved a three-story stone home from the Veterans Administration Hospital grounds near 70th and O streets to the site. A farmhouse was passed down through the family and predates a barn on the site where the reunion is held. Families...",

There are a few players dominating this space, with Suncor’s market share continuing to lead the way.So, for investors who are bullish on the future of this space, here’s why I think Suncor could look more attractive now than in years past.Suncor’s strong fundamentals provide investors with confidenceI think one of the most important attributes of any potential investment that needs to land properly for investors to earn a meaningful return over the long term is a company’s fundamentals. On this front, Suncor is a real winner.I’ve long discussed Suncor’s value as a top dividend stock holding for long-term investors. That’s as true today as it’s been in the past, given the company’s 4.5% dividend yield at the time of writing.But it’s the underlying fundamentals that drive this yield that are more important to many investors. Suncor’s record-breaking first-quarter (Q1) results highlighted the strength of the company’s operational efficiency initiatives and its commitment to growing its output, which hit 483,000 barrels per day.With strong free funds flow of roughly $1.9 billion this past quarter, the company’s dividend is well-covered, and this...",

        "content": "WASHINGTON - An pharmaceutical industry representative says Canada likely isn’t the main target of U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 200 per cent tariff on pharmaceutical imports — but his plan could still put parts of the Canadian sector in peril. Canadian Generic Pharmaceutical Association president Jim Keon says there’s a risk that Canada will get caught in the crossfire as Trump pushes to reduce Americans’ reliance on drugs imported from places like China and India. On Tuesday, Trump floated the idea of massive pharmaceutical tariffs but said he would give drug makers up to a year and a half before introducing the duties. Keon says Canadian exports amount to less than five per cent of all generic medicines sold in the U.S. But without access to the American market, he says, it might not be practical for some companies in Canada to continue producing certain generic medicines for the domestic market. Keon says there is hope that the economic and security agreement being negotiated between Canada and the United States will ensure pharmaceuticals remain tariff-free. This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 9, 2025.",

An officer who was trapped himself spotted dozens of people stranded on roofs and waded out to bring them to safety. That's according to a fellow officer who spoke Wednesday to a news conference. Another off-duty officer tied a garden hose around his waist so he could reach two people clinging to a tree above swirling floodwaters. More than 160 people still are believed to be missing and at least 118 have died in the floods. The floods are now the deadliest from inland flooding in the U.S. since 1976.

An officer who was trapped himself spotted dozens of people stranded on roofs and waded out to bring them to safety. That's according to a fellow officer who spoke Wednesday to a news conference. Another off-duty officer tied a garden hose around his waist so he could reach two people clinging to a tree above swirling floodwaters. More than 160 people still are believed to be missing and at least 118 have died in the floods. The floods are now the deadliest from inland flooding in the U.S. since 1976. Trump tariffs goods from Brazil at 50%, citing 'witch hunt' trial against Bolsonaro WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is singling out Brazil for import taxes of 50%, citing its treatment of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro. The announcement Wednesday shows that personal grudges rather than simple economics are driving the U.S. leader’s use of tariffs. Bolsonaro is charged with trying to overturn his 2022 election loss. Trump has described Bolsonaro as a friend and hosted the former Brazilian president at his Mar-a-Lago resort when both were in power in 2020.

Trump wrote in the letter posted on Truth Social that the trial “is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!” Trump's trade blitz produces few deals but lots of uncertainty WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and his advisers promised a lightning round of global trade negotiations with dozens of countries back in April. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro predicted “90 deals in 90 days.’’ Administration officials declared that other countries were desperate to make concessions to avoid the massive tariffs that Trump was threatening to plaster on their products starting July 9. But the 90 days have come and gone. And the tally of trade deals stands at two – one with the United Kingdom and one with Vietnam. Trump has now extended the deadline for negotiations to Aug. 1 and tinkered with his threatened tariffs, adding to global uncertainty.

Trump avoided his standard form letter with Brazil, specifically tying his tariffs to the trial of Bolsonaro, who is charged with trying to overturn his 2022 election loss. Trump has described Bolsonaro as a friend and hosted the former Brazilian president at his Mar-a-Lago resort when both were in power in 2020. “This Trial should not be taking place,” Trump wrote in the letter posted on Truth Social. “It is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!” There is a sense of kinship as Trump was indicted in 2023 for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The U.S. president addressed his tariff letter to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who bested Bolsonaro in 2022. Bolsonaro testified before the country’s Supreme Court in June over the alleged plot to remain in power after his 2022 election loss. Judges will hear from 26 other defendants in coming months. A decision could come as early as September, legal analysts say. Bolsonaro has already been ruled ineligible until 2030 by the country’s electoral authorities.

        "content": "SCOTTSDALE, Arizona — HonorHealth, one of the Valley's largest medical care providers, says they're at an \"impasse\" with Blue Cross Blue Shield to reach a new coverage agreement before their contract expires on Aug. 1. In a statement released July 8, HonorHealth said negotiations have been taking place for months but a deal has not yet been reached with the insurance provider. If an agreement is not settled before the deadline, then all HonorHealth facilities and physicians would be considered out-of-network for patients with Blue Cross Blue Shield. HonorHealth indicated the organization is seeking \"fair and reasonable reimbursement\" for the care they provide. \"To meet the needs of our growing community, we are committed to expanding access to care across the Valley, but Blue Cross Blue Shield’s restrictions limit our ability to grow,\" HonorHealth wrote in a statement. \"This includes not adding new facilities and providers at already agreed upon rates which results in having to negotiate new rates for services that are already provided within the network.\" Some patients could potentially qualify for continuity of care benefits if they're undergoing treatment for a life-threatening condition, terminal illness or pregnancy. If a new agreement isn't reached, then HonorHealth plans to contact all patients affected by the change.

Meanwhile, Sidney Whitmarsh’s mother, Stephanie Whitmarsh, is facing multiple felony charges — including accessory to a crime, tampering with evidence, and concealing a death — for allegedly helping cover up the hit-and-run.Sidney WhitmarshTwo others were also involved in the crime. Sidney Whitmarsh’s father, Arkansas resident Cean Whitmarsh, was sentenced to 120 days of electronic home monitoring and four years of supervised probation in February after pleading guilty to accessory.

LOUIS — Lawyers for Sheriff Alfred Montgomery on Wednesday accused the Missouri Attorney General’s Office of violating ethics rules by including false information about the sheriff hiring his half-brother in a lawsuit seeking Montgomery’s removal from office. In a hearing in St. Louis, David Mason, a former city judge, presented Judge Steven Ohmer with birth certificates showing Montgomery’s father was not the same one listed for his deputy, Malik Taylor. The space for a father’s name on Taylor’s certificate is blank, according to a copy provided to the Post-Dispatch. But Montgomery’s father was present to testify if needed, Mason told the judge. “He is not the father of the man alleged to be Malik Taylor,” Mason said. The accusations marked the start of what could become a fierce legal battle over whether Montgomery should be removed from office. In a lawsuit last month, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey’s office accused him of abusing his authority by hiring a relative, having a deputy pick up his children from school, refusing to transport city prisoners to the hospital and illegally detaining the city’s jail chief. The first hearing in the case was held Wednesday. Over the course of about an hour, lawyers argued about whether Montgomery should remain in office while the case is pending. Montgomery’s lawyers rebutted claims made in the lawsuit. And Judge Ohmer set a timeline for how the case would proceed, with a trial date of Nov. 10. Montgomery appeared...",

He studied under the extensive instruction of Moriba Kuyateh and the late Malamini Jobarteh in Gambia as well as both Youssoupha Cissokho and Mamadou Cissokho in Senegal, according to a news release. The kora is traditionally played by oral historians known as Griots. Many songs featured on the kora preserve an 800-year-old history dating back to the founding of the Mande empire. Gaskell has presented adult, youth and family programs at over 350 libraries and a multitude of K-12 schools, colleges, universities and assisted living facilities throughout North America.

On the right sits the past — dozens of faded, scratched leather-bound books containing over 100 years of handwritten climate data. One page — July 15, 1936 — shows a high temperature of 111 degrees, the then-second-hottest day on record for Columbia. “Back then, because of the lack of technology, a climatologist was somebody just skilled enough to use (weather) instruments, get the measurements, record them well,” he said. “That took a lot of time.” But now, Leasor spends far more time on the left side of his office, behind his computer. His dual monitors are often displaying weather models: precipitation, stream flow, soil moisture, crop conditions and reservoir levels. He uses this data to, among other things, determine if there’s drought in Missouri. The job of a climatologist has changed a lot in a hundred years. The climate has too. And those changes are making it harder to tell what is or isn’t a drought. That’s because drought is often defined as “drier-than-normal.” But if climate change is shifting what’s considered “normal,” what does that mean for drought? The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine is working on a study to answer that question. The query was originally brought to the independent nonprofit research organization by the National Integrated Drought Information System, a group within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

An officer who was trapped himself spotted dozens of people stranded on roofs and waded out to bring them to safety. That's according to a fellow officer who spoke Wednesday to a news conference. Another off-duty officer tied a garden hose around his waist so he could reach two people clinging to a tree above swirling floodwaters. More than 160 people still are believed to be missing and at least 115 have died in the floods. Biden's former doctor refuses to answer questions in House Republican probe WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden’s White House physician is refusing to answer questions as part of the House Republican investigation into Biden’s health in office. Dr. Kevin O’Connor invoked his rights under the Fifth Amendment during a closed-door interview Wednesday before the House Oversight Committee. Oversight Chair Rep. James Comer of Kentucky says O’Connor’s refusal to testify makes it “clear there was a conspiracy.” Republicans are probing Biden’s actions in office and questioning whether the Democrat's use of an autopen may have been invalid. Biden has called the claims “ridiculous and false.” The Oversight committee’s top Democrat, Rep. Robert Garcia of California, calls the Republican investigation a waste...",

With more than half of U.S. adults reporting they feel isolated, City Church Batavia is stepping forward to raise awareness about a simple, powerful solution-checking in. For over 25 years, City Church Batavia has built strong community ties in Batavia, New York. Their expertise isn't based on theory or trends. It's based on thousands of hours spent walking through life with people during their toughest and most meaningful moments. Through consistent personal outreach and group care systems, they've discovered a powerful truth: a simple follow-up message can change everything. \"I sent a text to someone who hadn't been around. They replied, 'I was really struggling and didn't think anyone noticed.' That's when I knew this mattered,\" said one volunteer. In a 2023 national survey, over 58% of adults in the U.S. said they feel lonely. For many, this isolation goes unnoticed. They disappear from social events, groups, or weekly routines-and no one checks in....",

On that site and in that little city 162 years ago, the field was still littered with the debris of war; the local residents and the Army medical corps were treating the wounded, the dead were being buried and life for the local people was decidedly not normal. It wasn’t all about fireworks and picnics, to be sure. The three-day battle, just before Independence Day, was a turning point in the Civil War, a decidedly uncivil armed conflict between the North and South over slavery. One of my dear friends, a Virginian by birth, still refers to that dark period of our history as the War of Northern Aggression. Apparently, there’s still blame being passed along. And there is a deep connection between Minnesota and Gettysburg. I lived in Pennsylvania for 15 years and had often taken visitors to Gettysburg. The commercial one-hour tour hits the high points, along with sound and music but one of the best days in life-long learning I ever spent was with a military historian from the Army War College in Carlisle who told the stories with passion about leadership lessons that are more than relevant today. And, dear readers three, it is all about leadership. The commanding officer of the Army of the Potomac, Major General George Meade, was in his fourth day (yes, fourth) day on the job when the battle began. President Lincoln had fired Major General Joseph Hooker on June 28. Mead was...",

The Islamist group's statement came after four days of indirect talks brokered by Qatar and as the United States signalled its belief that agreement for a 60-day truce would be struck before the end of the week. US special envoy Steve Witkoff said part of the deal would be the return of 10 living hostages held by militants since Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which sparked the war. Of 251 hostages seized during the assault on Israeli border communities near Gaza, 49 are still held in the territory, including 27 the Israeli military says are dead. In its statement, Hamas said key hurdles remained in the talks, notably the free flow of aid into Gaza, Israeli military withdrawal from the territory and \"real guarantees\" for a lasting peace. But it added: \"The movement displayed the required flexibility and agreed to release 10 prisoners (hostages). \"Despite the difficulty of negotiations over these issues until now due to the intransigence of the occupation, we continue to work seriously and with a positive spirit with the mediators to overcome the hurdles and end the suffering of our people and ensure their aspirations to freedom, safety and a dignified life.\" Israel earlier appeared to fall in behind US President Donald Trump and his optimism for an end to...",

The Islamist group's statement came after four days of indirect talks brokered by Qatar and as the United States signalled its belief that agreement for a 60-day truce would be struck before the end of the week. US special envoy Steve Witkoff said part of the deal would be the return of 10 living hostages held by militants since Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which sparked the war. Of 251 hostages seized during the assault on Israeli border communities near Gaza, 49 are still held in the territory, including 27 the Israeli military says are dead. In its statement, Hamas said key hurdles remained in the talks, notably the free flow of aid into Gaza, Israeli military withdrawal from the territory and \"real guarantees\" for a lasting peace. But it added: \"The movement displayed the required flexibility and agreed to release 10 prisoners (hostages). \"Despite the difficulty of negotiations over these issues until now due to the intransigence of the occupation, we continue to work seriously and with a positive spirit with the mediators to overcome the hurdles and end the suffering of our people and ensure their aspirations to freedom, safety and a dignified life.\" Israel earlier appeared to fall in behind US President Donald Trump and his optimism for an end to...",

The announcement Wednesday shows that personal grudges rather than simple economics are driving the U.S. leader’s use of tariffs. Bolsonaro is charged with trying to overturn his 2022 election loss. Trump has described Bolsonaro as a friend and hosted the former Brazilian president at his Mar-a-Lago resort when both were in power in 2020. Trump wrote in the letter posted on Truth Social that the trial “is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!” Trump's trade blitz produces few deals but lots of uncertainty WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and his advisers promised a lightning round of global trade negotiations with dozens of countries back in April. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro predicted “90 deals in 90 days.’’ Administration officials declared that other countries were desperate to make concessions to avoid the massive tariffs that Trump was threatening to plaster on their products starting July 9. But the 90 days have come and gone. And the tally of trade deals stands at two – one with the United Kingdom and one with Vietnam. Trump has now extended the deadline for negotiations to Aug. 1 and tinkered with his threatened tariffs, adding to global uncertainty.

He was 76, according to the toy company. Hasbro, the nation's second largest toy company behind Mattel, declined to offer more details. Hassenfeld's family foundation, Hassenfeld Family Initiatives, wasn't immediately available to comment. Hassenfeld was born in Providence, Rhode Island and graduated from Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts. He received an undergraduate arts degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1970. Upon graduation, he joined the Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based family business in 1970. Hasbro was founded in 1923, by Hassenfeld’s grandfather, Henry. Known initially as Hassenfeld Brothers, it sold textile remnants but expanded into school supplies and later toy manufacturing under the Hasbro name in the 1940s, according to Hasbro's website. It went public in 1968. Hassenfeld rose quickly in the family business serving as special assistant to the president and worked his way up the rank s. He became one of the key architects of Hasbro’s international operations and spent extensive time traveling overseas. He was named executive vice president in 1980 and became president in September 1984. Hassenfeld labored for years in the shadow of his older brother Stephen. His brother’s death of pneumonia in June 1989 at age 47, however, moved Hassenfeld into the position of chairman and chief...",

In the first quarter of 2025, Bombardierâs revenues climbed 19% year over year to $1.5 billion, reflecting higher aircraft deliveries and a steady rise in its high-margin services division. Profitability followed suit, with adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increasing 21% to $248 million, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) surged 69% year over year, reflecting improving operating leverage.Bombardierâs backlog remained strong at $14.2 billion as of March 31, 2025.

Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) reached $7 million, nearly matching the combined Q1 and Q2 totals of 2024. This strong performance was broad-based across all five business verticals.Hearth businesses Blaze King and ACR saw 17% sales growth despite entering their seasonally slower period. The agriculture division, led by IHT’s 60% surge, benefited from recovering pork prices that restored farmer confidence and investment. Industrial products companies collectively grew by 32%, while the merchandising business, Marketing Impact, expanded by 38%.The operational improvements drove cash flow generation, reducing the trailing 12-month dividend payout ratio from 96% to 82% and lowering the leverage ratio from 3.1 times to 2.7 times.

Indeed, the Canadian stock market has flown under the radar to a large degree, at least from the perspective of a global investor. As such, many top Canadian dividend stocks may have valuation multiples that are lower than the global benchmarks, with higher-than-average yields. The following three stocks I’m going to discuss in this piece are ones I think fit such a narrative. So, for investors looking for yields that can provide meaningful income from stocks that have the potential to continue to move higher over the long term, these are the companies I think are worth a closer look.EnbridgePipeline giant Enbridge (TSX:ENB) has been one of my top dividend stock picks in Canada for a long time.There’s good reason for this. The company’s impressive 6.1% dividend yield continues to put Enbridge on the radar screens of most yield-seekers. And it’s hard to argue that there are better, or more stable, dividend-generating stocks in the market at this company’s size (a market capitalization of more than $130 billion at the time of writing).Of course, Enbridge is a company that does carry a substantial amount of debt, tied to its capital-intensive business model. But with hopes rising that new pipelines could be approved in Canada for the first time in a long time, this is a stock I think could have some big upside from here.If anything, I’d expect...",

If Dolly Parton has taught us anything, it’s that you can never be too late to make a comeback, and the folks behind one formerly long-running Toronto steakhouse seem to agree, as they prepare to remount the legendary eatery after a 12-year closure. Those Toronto residents who were big on the old-school Italian steakhouse scene back in the late ’90s through the early 2000s will be thrilled to hear that none other than Centro Steak , which held court on Yonge Street just north of Eglinton for 25 years, is officially in its comeback era. The restaurant shut down in 2013 after a 25-year stint when owner Armando Mano opted to transform the space into Vita Sociale, a buzzy, still-Italian attempt at drawing in a younger crowd. Come 2015, Vita Sociale, too, had closed. For the decade that followed, the space was occupied by a particularly enormous location of Italian chain Cibo , which also boasts locations in Yorkville and on King West, becoming a neighbourhood staple in its own right before closing down due to irreconcilable differences with the property’s landlord in the first weeks of January 2025. Now, by some bizarre stroke of fate, the team behind Centro Steak has managed to get their hands back on the lease it had previously operated out of at 2472 Yonge Street, and is preparing to pick up right where they left off.

        "content": "In New Hampshire, adults now have a way to legally enjoy an alcoholic beverage on the streets. Governor Kelly Ayotte signed House Bill 467 into law on Monday, giving adults the green light to purchase to-go alcoholic drinks from bars and restaurants and enjoy them while walking through designated public zones known as “social districts” or “sip and stroll” areas. The law goes into effect on Sept. 5. State Rep. Michael Moffett, a Republican from Loudon, said legalizing public drinking is a welcome move for New Hampshire with a twofold benefit. “It enhances socializing, bringing people together to get to know each other in ways that they would not otherwise and also as an economic component where business takes place that would not happen otherwise,” said Moffett. However, it’s up to towns and cities to decide whether or not they want to establish a social district. In towns, the proposal must appear on the warrant of an annual town meeting. In cities, the legislative body may place it on the ballot during a regular municipal election or by citizen petition, signed by at least 5% of registered voters. The New Hampshire Liquor Commission will keep an updated list of all municipalities that approve social districts. Article continues after...

Many were shocked by the move, as he still had four years and $40 million remaining on his contract. The next move came when the Suns moved James Jones into a senior advisory role to install Brian Gregory as the new general manager. Jones had held the position of general manager since 2019. Now, owner Mat Ishbia has his hand-picked guy at the helm of the front office. Gregory and Ishbia's relationship goes back to their days at Michigan State, where Gregory was an assistant coach and Ishbia a player.

Since then, the museum has been able to offer education through their school programming for elementary and secondary students. That has included Indigenous storytelling through exhibits, gallery tours and stories of local legends, learning about trees rooted in North Vancouver, and Coast Salish wool weaving workshops. The programs and activities are led by Indigenous cultural programmers through the museum, but also knowledge keepers, artists, storytellers and speakers with local Coast Salish ties. But BMO boosted the recent renewal by $50,000 after hearing the programming’s impact. “That’s really how the majority of the funds are spent – creating space and then inviting in and working in collaboration with members...",

He emphasised that the trials represent Nigeria’s unwavering pursuit of justice and reaffirmation of its resolve to confront terrorism through lawful and transparent means. “It is truly encouraging to see the convergence of the Judiciary, law enforcement, legal practitioners, and partners, once again united in purpose and duty. These trials are a cornerstone of our national commitment to upholding the rule of law while addressing terrorism and violent extremism,” he said. General Laka noted that Nigeria has recorded significant successes in strengthening its criminal justice capacity to handle terrorism-related offences. He further highlighted that recent progress in the prosecution of such cases has played a critical role in addressing concerns raised by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). “Indeed, the advancements made through these trials have greatly contributed to Nigeria’s efforts toward exiting the FATF Grey List,” he...",

It’s among several recommendations made by a former B.C. Supreme Court chief justice appointed after a vehicle raced down a Vancouver street during the Lapu Lapu Day festival in April, killing 11 and injuring dozens more. The report by Christopher Hinkson makes six recommendations aimed at improving safety at all types of events, including development of a provincial hub for information and advice, stronger inter-agency co-ordination, and more accessible education and planning resources. Terry Yung, the minister of state for community safety and integrated services, released the report on Wednesday. He said the government fully accepted the intent of the recommendations, but didn’t say when they would be implemented. “We’ll move on this as fast as we can,” he said. “It’s important to understand, in light of the tragic event, and easy to be overwhelmed by emotions ... the report said the vast majority of public events in this province are safe, they’re well organized and they’re widely enjoyed.” While some events have access to professional support, the report says many celebrations rely on volunteers with little training or funding, and rather than impose rigid rules, the report says steps need to be taken for consistency and confidence in hosting gatherings.

        "content": "WASHINGTON - Former chief executive officer and president of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Tim Leiweke has been indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice for allegedly orchestrating a conspiracy to rig the bidding process for an arena at a public university in Austin, Texas. Leiweke, the co-founder of sports and real estate company Oak View Group (OVG), is charged with a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, facing a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a US$1-million fine. According to the DOJ, Leiweke told colleagues a rival company was “bidding against us” and expressed a desire to “get them to back down” — a goal he later achieved through a 2018 agreement under which the competitor didn’t submit a bid and instead received subcontracts, leaving OVG as the lone qualified bidder. None of the allegations have been proven in court. The project became the Moody Center, home to University of Texas basketball, and opened to the public in April 2022. OVG continues to receive significant revenues from the venue. OVG and Legends Hospitality have agreed to pay $15 million and $1.5 million in penalties, respectively, related to the conduct outlined in the indictment. In a statement that did not mention Leiweke, OVG said it “co-operated fully with the Antitrust Division’s inquiry” and was “pleased to have resolved this matter with no charges filed against OVG and no admission of fault or wrongdoing.” Leiweke was head of MLSE from 2013 to 2015 before moving on to OVG....",

        "content": "City officials said Monday that Rutland voters approved the wrong budget in March. According to a memo sent to the Board of Aldermen on Wednesday, the number that appeared on the town meeting ballot was $26,635,709.88. This was the budget initially proposed by Mayor Michael Doenges in November, and it was $807,649.50 more than the $25,828,060.38 that the board elected to send to the voters after making cuts. Doenges said that after consulting with the Vermont League of Cities and Towns, he determined that the error did not invalidate the budget vote because it had been repeated on the town meeting warning. With the numbers matching, he said, the budget’s approval was legal. The good news, Doenges said, was that the city would not be underfunded in the coming fiscal year. The bad news, he said, is, it would complicate the setting of the tax rate when the board meets for that purpose next week. “The concern is, we don’t want to charge more taxes than we actually have to,” he said. “The city treasurer is working on finding the right path forward so ... we can set the appropriate tax rate for the amount we need.” The city has set tax rates before supporting less than the voter-approved budget, removing items from the budget at the final meeting to set the tax rate. Doenges said it was not clear how the error happened. “I asked the (city) clerk to look into it, and we can’t find where the discrepancy occurred,” he said. “There’s conjecture but nothing factual. There’s no email...",

The announcement Wednesday shows that personal grudges rather than simple economics are driving the U.S. leader’s use of tariffs. Bolsonaro is charged with trying to overturn his 2022 election loss. Trump has described Bolsonaro as a friend and hosted the former Brazilian president at his Mar-a-Lago resort when both were in power in 2020. Trump wrote in the letter posted on Truth Social that the trial “is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!” Trump's trade blitz produces few deals but lots of uncertainty WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and his advisers promised a lightning round of global trade negotiations with dozens of countries back in April. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro predicted “90 deals in 90 days.’’ Administration officials declared that other countries were desperate to make concessions to avoid the massive tariffs that Trump was threatening to plaster on their products starting July 9. But the 90 days have come and gone. And the tally of trade deals stands at two – one with the United Kingdom and one with Vietnam. Trump has now extended the deadline for negotiations to Aug. 1 and tinkered with his threatened tariffs, adding to global uncertainty.

Veytia, who honed the public persona of a crusading, pistol-packing prosecutor, brazenly traveled between Mexico and the United States, confident that no one would see beyond his righteous, tough-on-crime facade. \"I didn't think I would be arrested,\" Veytia testified later. His sense of invulnerability was shattered on March 27, 2017, when U.S. agents busted Veytia at a border crossing in San Diego. This was no low-level mule who ferried drugs on his person, but a state attorney general who had facilitated cartel smuggling for years. Veytia pleaded guilty in January 2019 to narcotics trafficking. El Diablo, however, knew where the bodies were buried — a knowledge he peddled tirelessly to his U.S. handlers. And when he testified against an even bigger Mexican narco-politician, he secured a get-out-of-jail card — before completing even half of his 20-year U.S. prison sentence . Veytia, 55, was released from prison in February and is currently a free man, residing in the northeastern United States. But now he is facing some of his alleged victims in a singular legal action. Five Nayarit families — among them farmers, small business owners and a former police officer — are suing Veytia in federal court in Washington, D.C., under the Torture Victim Protection Act.

The high court's action will keep the law on hold while a legal challenge continues. The court did not explain its decision and no justice noted a dissent. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the legislation into law in February in support of Donald Trump’s push to crack down on illegal immigration, though many of the Republican's president efforts have been mired in legal battles . Florida's law made it a misdemeanor for people to enter the state if they don't have legal status. The measure is similar to a Texas law that also has been blocked by a federal appeals court. Immigrants rights groups filed lawsuits on behalf of two unnamed, Florida-based immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, arguing that immigration is a federal issue beyond the power of the states. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier’s appeal to the Supreme Court said the state has a right to use the law to protect itself from the “irreparable harm” of illegal immigration. U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams barred the enforcement of the new law in April. Uthmeier's office then unsuccessfully petitioned the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to override that decision. Wednesday's order is the latest blow for Uthmeier in a months-long battle. In June, Williams found the DeSantis appointee to be in contempt for...",

The City of Vancouver has confirmed that the sculpture, formerly known as Trans Am Totem, will remain in its new location for at least 10 years . Construction is already underway, with a massive concrete foundation poured in mid-June. Construction progress on the foundation for Trans Am Rapture at Granville Street Bridge’s southwest loop, as seen on June 19, 2025.

An online petition on change.org opposing the car sculpture has already drawn over 100 signatures. “We found out through online stories that this installation has already started.

There was no consultation,” Darlene Forst, a Fairview resident, artist, and television producer, told Daily Hive Urbanized. “The fact that there was no thought or consideration given to the residents of the neighbourhood... is unacceptable.” Another petition signer online commented, “As a concerned resident of the area, I am deeply disappointed that this decision appears to have been made without meaningful public consultation.

A bylaw to amend the town’s Municipal Development Plan (MDP) was passed during the June 18 regular meeting of council. Glen Fergusen, senior planner with the Town of Strathmore, explained the amendment establishes two new policies in the MDP. “The town’s 2024 Q3 corporate quarterly report carried over support from previous quarterly reports for establishing a residential to non-residential tax assessment ratio target,” he said. “The two policies [will] be added to the MDP in a very broad and general sense, aimed to enhance the town’s financial sustainability, (and) it (will) reduce reliance on residential property assessments.” What Fergusen described as “spin-off” benefits to the town include stimulation of local economic development through job creation and investment which coincides with non-residential development.

From 2018 to 2024, Leiweke allegedly led a scheme to steer the entertainment contracts for the 15,000 seat Moody Center arena to his company, Oak View Group, which he founded after leaving MLSE, according to a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice . Leiweke has been charged with violating the Sherman Antitrust Act and could face a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $1 million criminal fine, the release says. In an email, Leiweke’s spokesperson said he has “done nothing wrong and will vigorously defend himself and his well-deserved reputation for fairness and integrity.” “Vertical, complementary business partnerships” are legal, his spokesperson said. “These allegations blatantly ignore established legal precedent and seek to criminalize common teaming efforts that are proven to enhance competition and benefit the public.” Oak View Group said Leiweke will step down as CEO and transition to vice chairman of the company’s board of directors, a succession plan that was already underway. “The last thing I want to do is distract from the accomplishments of the team or draw focus away from executing for our partners,” Leiweke said in a press release.

He hasn't seriously contended in the six tournaments since then, including two majors. And then he finally made it back to familiar turf in the United Kingdom, where the scenery has his attention. McIlroy said he could hear the excitement in the voices of friends talking about his Masters win. And there's the anticipation of two weeks of a different brand of golf, the Scottish Open that starts Thursday and then the British Open at Royal Portrush in his native Northern Ireland. “I think over these last couple of weeks, coming back over here, seeing people that I know that I haven’t seen since Augusta, having conversations about how people felt watching it, obviously rekindles how I felt playing,” McIlroy said Wednesday. He went home to see his parents with his Masters green jacket. And then it was back to tournament golf, a media tour, more majors, all part of the routine. “It's been nice to have these couple of weeks to reflect, as well as rekindle my excitement and enthusiasm for the rest of the year,\" McIlroy said. “We have this week in Scotland and massive week next week in Portrush. I’m excited for the rest of year.” The Genesis Scottish Open is in its fourth year as a PGA Tour and European tour event, with more to come after Genesis...",

The Cowboys said on the team's website Monday night that Norman died this week, calling him one of the most influential players in the club's history. Norman went to coach Tom Landry to ask that the team quit assigning players hotel rooms based on race. The Cowboys soon started assigning rooms based on names. “I tried to do whatever I could do help change the kinds of things that society had operated under for such a long time,” Norman said. After playing in Dallas' 16-13 loss to the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl 5 in the 1970 season, Norman was traded to the San Diego Chargers for Pro Football Hall of Fame receiver Lance Alworth. The Cowboys won their first Super Bowl title the next season. Hall of Fame running back Calvin Hill said Black players on the team were angry because they thought Norman was traded because of his political activism. He had participated in a protest in Dallas before the trade. Norman became one of the first Black banking executives in Dallas, the team said. He attended historically Black Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, North Carolina, where he grew up after the family moved from his native Georgia. Norman spent nine of his 12 NFL seasons with the Cowboys. He had 183 catches for 2,492 yards and 15 touchdowns in 162 games. His family said in a Facebook post that Norman died in his sleep “peacefully,...",

The county’s vendor, Rocky View Utility Corporation, provides utility services within the various hamlets, and has been working with county staff to provide fixes to local utility accounts. Resulting refunds are a result from an investigation of issues from the contractor. Corrective action, being the replacement of water use meters, has been taken to ensure accuracy for payments going forward, aiming to reduce these types of situations. “Along with regular maintenance and upkeep of utility customers, staff and vendors have been working on the backlog of water meters that have not been able to be read,” said Cory Adamson, general manager of corporate and financial services. “Once resolved, we gain a proper reading on the use and bringing the accounts up to date. During some recent work, we have had three accounts show their use below the estimates and have refund requirements higher than $1,000.” The county’s corporate policy states that any refunds which are over $1,000 are to be brought before council. The Chief Administrative Officer is authorized to refund amounts less than $1,000. Summaries of those amounts refunded which are greater than $250 are to be presented before county council as well, as per the corporate and financial services policy. Total refund credits totalled $6,100.47 towards three utility accounts. These consisted of two...",

        "content": "May 5, 1934 - July 4, 2025 Watertown, WI - Barbara M. Bongard, 91, passed away on July 4, 2025. She was born in Lake Mills on May 5, 1934, to Wallace and Marna (Gruchow) Block. They moved to Watertown when Barb was six months old. She attended St. Mark's grade school and Watertown High School, graduating in 1952. She worked at her family's business, Block's Meat Market, after graduating. Barb married Phillip Bongard on February 23, 1957. Barb started working at Merchants National Bank (later Chase Bank) in 1965. She worked as a Bookkeeper, Account Specialist and Personal Banker, retiring in 1995. She volunteered at Watertown Regional Medical Center and was a member of the Elks Club Auxiliary. Barb and Phil were long-time members of St. Bernard's Catholic Church. In addition to her parents, Barb was preceded in death by her husband, Phil, and sister-in-law, Sue Block. Barb and Phil had two sons, Scott Bongard of Schaumburg, IL and David (Carey) Bongard of Mequon. She is further survived by her brothers, Rich Block of Watertown and Tom (Dawn) Block of Madison; three grandchildren, Ryan (Stefanie) Bongard, Kate (Collin) Filipp and Kendall Bongard. Barb was also very proud of her six great grandchildren, Jackson, William, Cameron and Reid Bongard, and Mollie and River Filipp. It is fitting that Barb passed away on a holiday. She loved a great party, and she and Phil hosted many cook-outs and gatherings at their home. They enjoyed playing cards and their laughter was contagious....",

The Valkyries improved to 10-9 after losing the first two games of a four-game road trip in Minnesota and Atlanta. Now 3-6 on the road, it was the first win outside the state of California for Golden State, which counted its first two road victories against the Sparks in Los Angeles. The WNBA leader in field-goal percentage defense, Golden State held Indiana to 21-for-68 shooting (30.9%) and 6-for-27 shooting on 3-point attempts. The 61 points were the fewest a Golden State opponent has scored all season. “Overall we played team basketball today and I think that’s something we’ve been missing,” Valkyries coach Natalie Nakase said. “We played team defense. I’d say the last two games it got a little individual. Credit to our players, just being coachable, coachable, coachable.” For Indiana (9-10), it was the second state loss to the Valkyries, losing 88-77 at Chase Center on June 19. Veronica Burton led the Valkyries with 21 points, including a career-high five 3-point baskets on six attempts. All-Star Kayla Thornton missed her first six shots but came on strong in the second half and finished with 18 points, including four 3-pointers as the Valkyries had 12 in all. Indiana star Caitlin Clark, who had missed the previous five games with a groin injury, struggled...",

        "content": "RALEIGH, N.C. — Gov. Josh Stein vetoed legislation on Wednesday that would have given private schools the option to allow teachers or school volunteers to carry concealed handguns on campus. House Bill 193 would have permitted employees or volunteers at private schools to carry firearms or stun guns on school grounds if they received written permission from the school’s board of trustees or administrative director, had a concealed handgun permit, and completed an approved training course. The bill would have also required schools wanting to allow their employees to carry handguns to adopt “written standard operating procedures” for possessing and carrying weapons on school property and distribute those to parents of students. Republicans and supporters of gun rights argued the bill would make schools, particularly those located in rural areas, safer by giving them the option to have someone on school grounds who is armed and can deal with a school shooter. Democrats and groups that advocate for stricter gun laws slammed the bill, saying the presence of firearms on campuses would make schools unsafe. In a statement, Stein said the bill would “make our children less safe” and argued that law enforcement officers and school resource officers who go through extensive training to protect the public should not be substituted by school teachers and volunteers. “Just as we should not allow guns in the General Assembly, we should keep them out of our schools unless they are in the...",

He recovered to win two more Tours: by the race's narrowest margin (eight seconds) in 1989 and again in 1990. “The honor is more than I ever expected, and I accept it with deep gratitude and also with a profound sense of humility,” LeMond said. “Today isn’t just about reflecting on my own journey.

Both shows center an autistic woman who works in a police department and strikes up an unexpected partnership with a detective who spots their keen eye for noticing patterns others missed in investigations. Astrid et Raphaëlle debuted in 2020 and is still ongoing, and Patience makes some key tweaks with its adaptation. The most important change is the fact that the star of Patience , Ella Maisy Purvis , is autistic herself, whereas Astrid star Sara Mortensen is not. Purvis tells TV Insider that she didn’t watch Astrid et Raphaëlle prior to filming Patience Season 1. “I didn’t watch it, and I didn’t know about it before,” she shares. “I looked it up obviously, and it’s quite funny because it is just French me and Laura [Fraser , who costars as DI Bea Metcalf]. But no, I didn’t watch it.” Purvis avoided watching the original inspiration for her series because she didn’t want to unintentionally influence her performance. “I think I knew if I watched it, I’d then not be able to shake that idea from my head,” Purvis explains. “And we wanted to create something that wasn’t like a carbon copy as much as it follows a very similar kind of structure, didn’t want to fall into that. I don’t want to be influenced by her portrayal of that character.” Nor should she. While Patience is based on Astrid , there would be no point in making a new adaptation if they were to just recreate what’s already been done. Because of...",

More than 50 authors have signed up to participate in the festival and will be on hand selling and signing their books. The authors will also be participating in discussion panels throughout the day outside the library storefront and several children’s authors will be reading their books to visiting children outside of Belk’s. “We’ve hosted Behind the Book events over the past several years, but those have only highlighted one author or illustrator at a time,” said Interim Library Manager Stephanie Griffin. “With this festival, we’ll be able to highlight dozens of local and region authors and showcase their amazing works.” The festival is sponsored by the Friends of the Kingsport Public Library.

The fire ignited around 10:50 p.m. between The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints church building on the 1700 block of Kinghorn Road and a home on nearby Aaron Lane. Pocatello police, members of the church and neighborhood residents were the first ones on the scene and used fire extinguishers and a garden hose to hold back the flames, which were burning within feet of the church and the house. Pocatello firefighters arrived minutes later and quickly extinguished the fire, which scorched less than an acre. The fire did not result in any injuries, evacuations or damage to structures, likely because of the police and others who worked to keep the flames from spreading prior to the arrival of firefighters. Police shut down Aaron Lane for about an hour while firefighters were on the scene. Authorities said the cause of the fire is unknown but the Pocatello Fire Department is investigating.",

Kehoe, a Republican in his first year as chief executive, spent the day signing 13 bills sent to him by lawmakers this spring. Along with the cellphone ban, which won’t take effect until the 2026-27 school year, the governor raised the legal age for getting married, paved the way for homeschooled students to play on public school sports teams, boosted penalties for hazing and gave public safety personnel and their families free college tuition. \"From implementing distraction-free classrooms to expanding school safety efforts, the legislation signed into law this afternoon impacts both K-12 students and Missourians pursuing higher and career technical education,\" Kehoe said. The cellphone legislation included in Senate Bill 68 will bar school students from using their phones from the beginning of the school day until the final bell rings. Its passage reflects widespread voter support, according to polling conducted by St. Louis University and YouGov in February. Over 70% of likely Missouri voters favor prohibiting students from accessing cellphones during regular instructional activities across all K–12 schools, the survey found. “It’s rare to see such agreement on any education issue, but voters across political and demographic lines agree that cellphones should be off-limits during school hours,” said Ashley Burle, associate director of the...",

        "content": "INGRAM, Texas — Riding on horseback through brush and over dead turkeys, Margo Mellon spent Tuesday scanning the flood-ravaged ground of Texas' Hill Country for dead bodies. As she and her rescue mates trudged through the muddy terrain, state officials announced that more than 160 people are still believed to be missing. With countless miles swamped by the floods, nobody knows when the searches will end. The triumphs of finding people alive ended days ago, while the mission of recovering bodies that might include even more children is far from over. The grim undertaking has prompted questions about how first responders and rescue teams are able to mentally reckon with the work ahead. Mellon, a 24-year-old volunteer with search and recovery organization Texas EquuSearch that is a working with local fire departments, said for now she feels emotionally detached as she focuses on the task. But she knows the experience will be difficult to process once she returns home to Corpus Christi. Margo Mellon, a volunteer with Texas EquuSearch, poses for a portrait Tuesday in Ingram, Texas. \"I'll try not to think about it too much,\" she said. \"I'll just think about the fact that at least the families have closure.\" The flash floods deluged homes, campgrounds and an all-girls summer camp over Fourth of July weekend. More than 100 people have been killed, including 30 children. \"We process it the best we can,\" Lt. Colonel Ben Baker of the Texas Game Wardens said Tuesday at a news conference...",

Subdivision moratorium The temporary prohibition, which applies to subdivision proposals with more than five buildable lots and any current subdivision seeking to add a sixth buildable lot, could last for up to 180 days, as the county councilmembers have reportedly heard of landowners drilling for water to no avail. Angie Zetterquist, Cache County’s interim director of development services, referenced a joint meeting held between the Cache County Council and the Planning Commission, in which these concerns were brought to a head. “(The moratorium) would allow staff time to do research on other jurisdictions, on how they handle water, and find best practices moving forward on our subdivision process,” Zetterquist said. Zetterquist also noted any proposed changes to the county’s handling of its water would then be brought forth to the Cache County Council. Councilmember Nolan Gunnell, who has voiced his concern of the county’s water supply many times, also noted a portion of the joint meeting, stating water quality of hypothetical 20-lot subdivisions should be a top priority, as well. After Council Chair Sandi Goodlander asked who would be taking which actions, regarding potential solutions, Zetterquist provided options...",

City staff aim to reassess current conditions, usage patterns and future needs in creating “a data-driven road map for improving, maintaining and operating the park,” the project page on the Engage Kitchener website says. Last summer, sensors were placed at major entrances and frequently used spaces in the park to collect data on the site’s usage. Ongoing community engagement includes an upcoming workshop where participants can help frame staff recommendations for the master plan. The event will take place July 18 from 6 to 8:30 p.m. at the Victoria Park Pavilion ( 80 Schneider Ave. ). People can drop in any time. The workshop is a followup to two previous “visioning” sessions held in May and June. People can also complete an online park user survey, use an interactive map to flag a favourite spot in the park or suggest a potential change, and share a story or photo illustrating what makes Victoria Park a special place to them.

Although cell phones are a helicopter parent’s digital nanny in assuaging their overblown separation anxiety, tech addiction is a ubiquitous learning distraction besieging schools nationwide. Many school systems, including Ashe County Schools, have cell phone policies but administrators are revisiting the code of conduct with the recent availability of Yondr pouches. A Yondr pouch is a lockable pouch designed to create phone-free spaces, such as schools. A magnetic mechanism locks the pouch, which can only be opened with a special base unit. The Ashe County School System is also considering revising student cell phone use reflecting pending state legislation. Gov.

LeMond, 64, received the medal during a ceremony at the Capitol with his wife, Kathy, and children in attendance. It was announced he'd receive the medal in 2020, but the pandemic delayed his ceremony. “It is the highest honor that we can bestow in this institution,\" Republican U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said. “It honors citizens whose contributions have shaped our country, enriched our history and lifted the spirits of the American people. And much like the American Dream itself, this honor is not reserved for any one person and profession, it can be earned and won by anyone who’s deserving.” LeMond, a two-time World Road Race champion, was shot on a hunting trip in 1987 at the peak of his career, shortly after becoming the first American man to win the Tour de France. He recovered to win two more Tours: by the race's narrowest margin (eight seconds) in 1989 and again in 1990. “The honor is more than I ever expected, and I accept it with deep gratitude and also with a profound sense of humility,” LeMond said. “Today isn’t just about reflecting on my own journey. It’s about honoring the people, places and the moments that shaped it.” Johnson presented the medal alongside Democratic Rep. Mike Thompson of California and former Republican Rep.

        "content": "In investing, it helps to have goals. Whether that’s minimizing risk, maximizing returns or something in between, you should know what you’re after: what you measure gets better.A common investment goal is maximizing dividend income. Some investors perceive that dividends are a surer thing than capital gains and want as much yield in their portfolios for this reason. The academic jury is still out on this — there’s evidence that dividend investing works in tax-sheltered retirement accounts, but underperforms in taxable accounts (dividends are taxed more frequently than long-term capital gains).Personally, I do set annual dividend and interest income goals, mainly because such income sources tend to be more stable than returns from capital gains. This year, I hit (actually exceeded) my $5,000 projected income goal. For next year, I’m setting my goal at +$6,000. In this article, I will explore how I plan to get there.Guaranteed investment certificatesGuaranteed investment certificates (GICs) are fixed-income securities offered by Canadian banks. They function like bonds; you agree to have your money lent out for a while, and in return, you get some interest income. I put quite a bit of my money into GICs back in 2022 and 2023, when interest rates were high. In 2024, rates started to come down as the Bank of Canada began cutting that year. Today, you can only get about 2.5% on GICs (unless you buy index-linked GICs, which are riskier).Because GICs have less yield now than they...",

LeMond, 64, received the medal during a ceremony at the Capitol with his wife, Kathy, and children in attendance. It was announced he'd receive the medal in 2020, but the pandemic delayed his ceremony. Three-time Tour de France winner Greg LeMond, center, is joined by his wife Kathy LeMond, right, while being presented the Congressional Gold Medal by Speaker of the House Mike Johnson during a ceremony Wednesday at the Capitol in Washington. “It is the highest honor that we can bestow in this institution,\" Republican U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said. “It honors citizens whose contributions have shaped our country, enriched our history and lifted the spirits of the American people. And much like the American Dream itself, this honor is not reserved for any one person and profession, it can be earned and won by anyone who’s deserving.” LeMond, a two-time World Road Race champion, was shot on a hunting trip in 1987 at the peak of his career, shortly after becoming the first American man to win the Tour de France. He recovered to win two more Tours: by the race's narrowest margin (eight seconds) in 1989 and again in 1990. “The honor is more than I ever expected, and I accept it with deep gratitude and also with a profound sense of humility,” LeMond said. “Today isn’t just about reflecting on my...",

Obviously, I’m going to visit this subject now with my physio and hopefully all will be well in two days.” That's when he will take on three-time major champion Sinner, who didn’t play like someone dealing with an injured right elbow while using terrific serving and his usual booming forehand to beat 10th-seeded Ben Shelton 7-6 (2), 6-4, 6-4. “I look forward to that,” said Djokovic, who has lost his last four meetings with Sinner, including in the French Open semifinals last month. “That's going to be a great matchup.” Djokovic is 2-0 against Sinner at Wimbledon, eliminating him in the 2023 semifinals and 2022 quarterfinals.

The Town of Strathmore voted to repeal their local code of conduct bylaw during the June 18 regular meeting of council. “We have yet to see how it is going to roll out, what it is going to be like, how effective it will be, how responsive or nimble it will be if we do have council problems,” said Mayor Pat Fule. “I think I understand the rationale for switching. I have been talking to one of the ministers; there was definitely some concern that there have been some problems on councils throughout Alberta and that it has become unworkable or almost unmanageable.” The province’s Bill 50 amends the Municipal Government Act. The amendments give the province power to establish procedures for councils and council committee meetings and amend those procedures by ministerial order. It is also specified the Regulations Act does not apply to orders made under the amended MGA. Municipal councils are not able to make bylaws or resolutions under the MGA which address the behaviour or conduct of councillors, or of members of council committees who are not councillors. “The thing that was said to me was that they were worried that some councils have been weaponizing the code of conduct and that can be a problem as well,” said Fule. “It can be difficult for a council to discipline itself when things arise. There can be a lot of...",

Timothy Leiweke, the CEO of Denver-based sports and real estate company Oak View Group, is accused of conspiring with a competitor to rig the contract for the $338 million arena that opened in 2022. According to an indictment from the Department of Justice, in September 2017, Leiweke told colleagues he had learned another company was “bidding against [Oak View Group]” for the project that would become the Moody Center, and wanted to “find a way to get [the competitor] some of the business” and “get them to back down.” The indictment then says in November 2017, Leiweke told people he was “[m]ore than happy talking to [the competitor] about not bidding and [receiving certain subcontracts]” but had “no interest in working with them if they intend on putting in a bid.” In February 2018, he ultimately reached an agreement with the CEO of the competing company, in exchange for the competitor to neither submit nor join an independent competing bid for the project. In exchange for the competing company not submitting a bid, Leiweke allegedly allowed the competitor to get subcontracts for the project. Oak View Group ultimately submitted the only qualified bid for the arena and won the project. The group has agreed to pay $15 million in penalties, while another company, Legends Hospitality, will pay $1.5 million. Prior to...",

        "content": "Colpi, carattere, coraggio. Personalità. Sembra strano raccontare un quarto di finale sul Centre court a Wimbledon, partendo dallo sconfitto. Ma è comunque Flavio Cobolli il protagonista di giornata. Il guerriero che voleva diventare un calciatore della Roma, la squadra del cuore, ha stupito tutti. Incantando perfino il New York Times, che gli ha dedicato un lungo e approfondito ritratto. Ha lottato da gladiatore nel Colosseo, mettendo in crisi l’highlander Novak Djokovic prima di arrendersi: 6-7, 6-2, 7-5, 6-4 dopo tre ore e venti di lotta serrata e incertissima. Alla fine ha vinto il Migliore, i suoi sette titoli a Londra lo provano. Però va sottolineato che Flavio – 23 anni contro 38, primo quarto di finale Slam davanti ai 24 Slam nella bacheca del rivale – ha stupito nel giorno dell’esame di laurea, davanti al docente di cui tiene il poster appeso in camera. Conoscevamo la sua forza, non fino a questo punto. I progressi degli ultimi mesi sono stati straordinari, fra talento e agonismo al di là dei due titoli vinti a Bucarest e Amburgo. E’ migliorato in tutto: dritto, rovescio, gioco di volo, il servizio in particolare. E ancora attitudine, resistenza, gestione della partita. La classifica live lo piazza ora al diciannovesimo posto: in sostanza l’Italia festeggia un altro giocatore di prima fila, è già questo è clamoroso. “Chiederò a mio figlio Stefan come batterlo, l’altro giorno hanno palleggiato assieme”, aveva detto scherzando Djokovic alla vigilia.

        "content": "While it’s an unlikely outcome, some investors have staked out positions in futures markets that will profit if interest rates drop immediately after Jerome Powell’s term as chair ends in May 2026. The trade has been fueled by President Donald Trump’s pledge to nominate “somebody that wants to cut rates.” Those investors have targeted futures contracts linked to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, which closely tracks the benchmark federal funds rate. They’ve sold off contracts that expire prior to Powell’s exit and piled into contracts that expire just after the expected arrival of a Trump-appointed chair. It’s a trade that takes a chance on Trump getting his way, shrugging off how the central bank goes about setting rates. A chair “can’t act like a dictator,” said Mark Gertler, an economics professor at New York University who has co-authored papers with former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke and former Vice Chair Richard Clarida. “He can’t call in the Marines or anything like that.” Adjusting rates, Gertler pointed out, requires the support of a majority on the Federal Open Market Committee. Nineteen policymakers participate in FOMC meetings and 12 vote. In other words, the new chair will have to win over their colleagues with a reasonable case for cutting. Contenders for the Fed chair job include former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, Bloomberg has reported. Current Fed Governor...",

The BC Prosecution Service says James Plover was originally charged in June 2024 in a case involving intimate partner violence, before being released on $500 bail and subject to what it says were “extensive protective conditions.” James Plover was then charged with two more counts of uttering threats, the original case was stayed, and he was convicted last week in the new case that folded in the previous charges, with the victims’ identities protected by a publication ban. Bailey Plover’s uncle, Morey Maslak, says she had been estranged from James Plover since last year, and she was a “loving, devoted mother” with a great sense of humour and a carefree happy-go-lucky nature.

Djokovic, meanwhile, will be appearing in his 52nd major semifinal, which ties Chris Evert for the most by any man or woman in the Open era. Not everything went smoothly for Djokovic, who served for the opening set at 5-3 but got broken at love. He later was a point from owning that set before Cobolli came through. And on his second match point, his right foot slid out from under him and he did the splits as he went down to the grass and landed on his stomach. Two points later, though, the victory was complete. Earlier, Djokovic did stretches and breathing exercises at changeovers. He whacked his shoe with his racket after one miss in the fourth set. He seemed bothered at times by the bright sun above Centre Court.

        "content": "Caitlin Clark is not only the captain of a WNBA All-Star team in her second year , but she's also finally using her star power to rewrite the rules of the game. The Indiana Fever guard used her captain powers not just to draft a team of starters and reserves but also to make a coaching change in a way the WNBA has never seen. The two-time All-Star announced she and co-captain Napheesa Collier would not be trading players from their drafted teams, but instead swapped head coaches Cheryl Reeve and Sandy Brondello, who is actively trying to change a rule of her own . \"To be completely honest, I love my team. I think they're great. I don't have any intentions on trading any of them,\" Clark said when asked by Malika Andrews. \"I don't know if this is in the rules, I don't really care, but we already discussed that we're gonna trade coaches.\" \"Phee is gonna take her coach. Sandy, let's get it,\" she continued while pounding her chest. \"Sorry, ESPN or WNBA, if that’s not in the rules, but we just made it a rule. So Sandy, come on over.\" Just like that, the Liberty coach was swapped in to lead Team Clark, while Reeve was gifted her perennial MVP candidate in Collier. On the surface, the move looked like a playful, fun, spontaneous deal made between friends in the spirit of All-Star shenanigans. But for longtime WNBA watchers, theories developed that Clark didn't want to play for Reeve, and fans think the feeling might be mutual. Reeve was appointed as Team USA's head coach for the...",

A newly released CIA review challenges their sworn denials to Congress that the Steele dossier – a discredited set of allegations about Trump funded by Hillary Clinton’s campaign – was used as the basis for the years-long Russiagate probe that hamstrung President Trump’s first term. The eight-page review conducted by career CIA analysts found the dossier did, in fact, worm its way into the text of the highly classified report known as an Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) to buttress the thinly sourced, yet inflammatory allegation that “Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump’s election chances.” “Ultimately, agency heads decided to include a two-page summary of the dossier as an annex to the ICA, with a disclaimer that the material was not used ‘to reach the analytic conclusions,’” the CIA review said on page five. “However, by placing a reference to the annex material in the main body of the ICA as the fourth supporting bullet for the judgment that Putin ‘aspired’ to help Trump win, the ICA implicitly elevated [the dossier’s] unsubstantiated claims to the status of credible supporting evidence, compromising the analytical integrity of the judgment.” The CIA’s “lessons-learned” report contradicts Obama...",

        "content": "On a floodplain in the Democratic Republic of the Congo sat a shrinking pond, doomed to eventually dry up. Inside its murky waters swam a scaly blue creature with “large” yellow eyes. Something about it caught the attention of passing scientists — and for good reason. It turned out to be a new species. Béla Nagy and a team of “colleagues from the University of Lubumbashi” spent seven years visiting rivers in southern Africa to survey “seasonal” fish known as killifish , Nagy wrote in a study published June 30 in the peer-reviewed journal Ecology and Diversity. Native to Africa, killifish live in “ephemeral wetlands” of the savanna, the study said. They have short lifespans to survive the “periodic drying out of their natural habitats.” Every wet season, they hatch, breed and bury their eggs before dying off during the dry season in an annual cycle. During their 2023 surveys, researchers found a few unfamiliar-looking killifish, the study said. They took a closer look at the animals, analyzed their DNA and realized they’d discovered a new species: Nothobranchius katemomandai, or Katemo Manda’s seasonal killifish. Katemo Manda’s seasonal killifish are considered “medium sized,” reaching about 1.7 inches in length, the study said. Males are “robust,” while females are “slightly more slender.” Both have “short” heads with “slightly pointed” snouts, “slightly curved” teeth and “large” yellow eyes. Males and females of the new species vary in coloring. Photos show the females,...",

After graduating, they’re required to return to China for two years. In the letters sent Tuesday, Republicans described it as a threat to national security.“CSC purports to be a joint scholarship program between U.S. and Chinese institutions; however, in reality it is a CCP-managed technology transfer effort that exploits U.S. institutions and directly supports China’s military and scientific growth,” wrote Republican Rep. John Moolenaar, chair of the committee.The Chinese Embassy didn’t immediately respond to a request by The Associated Press for comment.Related ArticlesMan accused of Trump assassination attempt in Florida seeks to remove defense attorneys from caseNew lawsuit seeks to redraw Wisconsin’s congressional maps before 2026 midtermsSupreme Court keeps hold on Florida immigration law aimed at people in the US illegallySenate confirms new FAA administrator at...",

The project proposes extending the Big Sioux River left bank levee system north along River Drive to replace the area identified for a temporary sandbag levee during high water events to reduce flood risk in Riverside, according to a statement released by the city Wednesday. Last November, city staff applied for the grant, which covers 50% of the design and construction costs, estimated at around $1.73 million. The city is responsible for all of the required property acquisition costs of around $935,000. Sioux City Fire Rescue firefighters move by boat down Fairbanks Street in Sioux City's Riverside neighborhood while making a house-by-house search on June 24, 2024. Evacuations were occurring in the wake of flooding from the Big Sioux and Missouri rivers. Tim Hynds, Sioux City Journal The total project is estimated to cost over $2.65 million and take three years to complete from commencement to final FEMA map revisions. Three homes along River Drive were purchased earlier this year, and homeowners were relocated. \"The demolition of these homes is underway and the engineering design process will begin in the next few months once the funding agreements are executed,\" the statement said.

The five-star guard arrives at USC this summer as the most highly anticipated recruit of Musselman's tenure. Musselman — who coached Arenas' father, Gilbert, with the Golden State Warriors — has said on multiple occasions that he expects Arenas to be a difference-maker as a freshman. The question now is how quickly Arenas can get up to speed after missing the first month of summer practice with a team that was totally rebuilt through the transfer portal. USC's coach certainly isn't concerned about Arenas fitting in. Since arriving on campus, Musselman said, Arenas has made a point to follow the coach around on the court during practice. \"I think he knows the offense, on paper, maybe better than anyone on our team,\" Musselman said. \"He's got an innate ability to kind of see things in a different manner. \"I would anticipate him picking it up really quick because he's come into our office. He's diagramming stuff during practice. He's talking to managers and GA's about where he should be on the floor.\" It was a harrowing few months for Arenas leading up to him being cleared at USC. One early morning in late April, he lost control of his Tesla Cybertruck and hit a tree. The car burst into flames, leaving him trapped inside. He was...",

The ASPCA provided funds to waive adoption fees at most participating shelters. A total of 148 animal welfare organizations across 212 event locations worked collaboratively to find homes for 4,979 pets, outpacing the 3,609 pets that were adopted during the inaugural event in 2024. The initiative was generously supported by actor Rob Lowe , who served as the official celebrity ambassador for California Adopt-a-Pet Day, with additional support spreading the word on social media from celebrities including Paris Hilton , Toks Olagundoye , Eric McCormack , Anjelica Huston , Allison Janney , Alexandra Shipp, Christian Meier , Juan Pablo Espinosa , Maxwell Jenkins , and the Los Angeles Chargers .

The administration’s fiscal 2026 budget request seeks to end the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives as a separate component, wipe away the Office on Violence Against Women’s status as a separate office and cut appropriated funding for the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration.

The draft text will also show where lawmakers stand on the administration’s lesser-known budget initiatives, including reduced funding for Justice Department’s National Security Division, the zeroing-out of grant initiatives aimed at addressing hate crimes and cuts to grants that go toward helping domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. The text could also provide insight into whether the Senate will agree with an administration proposal to slash funding for the Justice Department’s Office of the Inspector General, a watchdog tasked with finding waste, fraud and abuse. The administration’s proposal to fold the work of the ATF into the Drug Enforcement Administration is meeting opposition from groups on both...",

While McArthurGlen lacks the dramatic indoor waterfall and lush gardens of Jewel’s glass dome, it offers a European village-themed retail experience with a wide range of designer brands, dining options, and seasonal events. Some visitors in online reviews have even described it as reminiscent of Main Street, U.S.A. at Disneyland, highlighting its charming atmosphere and faux heritage design. Another immersive element — perhaps not intended for this specific purpose — is offered specifically by the mall’s location on Sea Island. Situated just beyond the east end of the north runway and directly beneath YVR’s primary arrivals flight path, the mall’s open-air layout has made it one of the best spots in the country for plane spotting, with the bellies of jets passing directly overhead and the roar of their engines echoing through the air — all experienced while comfortably enjoying a beverage from Caffe Artigiano. From the outset during the mall’s planning process in the early 2010s, this mall was intended to be an inviting destination not only for travellers with layovers or extra time before flights, but also for local residents seeking an accessible and big brand shopping experience at outlet prices — something that was previously only available across the Canada-U.S. border in Bellingham and near Seattle....",

For years, Samson has been playing Lotto 6/49, choosing numbers through Quick Picks. One day, he decided to stop at Dépanneur Voisin to buy a Lotto 6/49 ticket. After the draw, he stopped at a gas station and headed to the convenience store to validate his ticket. While waiting for the clerk to check his ticket, Samson joked with the customer behind him, stating, “This guy never gives me a win!” But Samson was quickly proven wrong. To his surprise, he heard a sound from the terminal announcing that he had won and not just any prize — he won $1 million in the June 4 Lotto 6/49 draw.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor) As the company that operates New Jersey’s grid begins a new electricity auction that will help set rates for future utility bills, a group of House members say they want to avoid a repeat of last year’s auction results that led to skyrocketing electric prices this summer.

PJM is the grid operator for New Jersey and 12 other states. In New Jersey, utilities annually buy electricity supply through auctions like the one PJM is hosting starting Wednesday (it ends July 15, with results public on July 22). Its July 2024 auction saw electric capacity prices reach record totals, increasing by more than 800% over the previous year, an increase that helped contribute to skyrocketing electric bills New Jersey customers saw starting...",

And as folks began assembling for the daily hot lunch served at the Riverton Senior Center, volunteers loading up coolers were on a mission: to serve dozens of homebound seniors through the Meals on Wheels program. It’s a program that doesn’t often make headlines, but one that is crucial for a major sector of Riverton’s population. Meals on Wheels currently serves between 78-85 people, with a waiting list for folks eager to sign up. Each receives a nutritious meal each weekday, with frozen meals sent out every Thursday to help them get through the weekend. And organizers are putting out the call; volunteers willing to step up to the plate and help deliver keep the program sustainable, and they are desperately needed now. Riverton Senior Center Executive Director Kimber Tower explained that the volunteers who help drive the program save tens of thousands of dollars annually and truly power the effort. There are four routes daily, and each takes less than two hours to complete. Those interested in helping out can sign up for a day or two a week or volunteer to be a substitute. Volunteer Jack Schmidt said the program is about much more than just a plate of good food — it’s about checking in on your neighbors, lending a hand and a listening ear, and giving back. “For me, what I found out is that’s much, much more than the...",

(AP) — A man awaiting trial on federal charges of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump last year at his Florida golf course is seeking to get rid of his court-appointed federal public defenders. A hearing for Ryan Routh's motion regarding the proposed termination of his appointed counsel is scheduled for Thursday in Fort Pierce, according to court records. The motion requesting the hearing didn't say why Routh, 59, no longer wished to be represented by Kristy Militello and Renee Michelle Sihvola. The attorneys didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. It wasn't immediately clear whether Routh was hiring a new attorney or planned to represent himself. Prosecutors have said Routh methodically plotted to kill Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Trump played golf on Sept. 15, 2024, at his West Palm Beach country club. Before Trump came into view, Routh was spotted by a Secret Service agent. Routh allegedly aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot. Law enforcement obtained help from a witness who prosecutors said informed officers that he saw a person fleeing. The witness was then flown in a police helicopter to a nearby interstate where Routh was arrested and the witnesses confirmed it was the person he had seen, prosecutors have said. Routh faces charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate , possessing a firearm in...",

That’s when former Kerr County Commissioner Tom Moser realized something had to be done. \"I knew that there was that kind of potential and even greater in Kerr County,\" Moser said. The danger in Kerr County isn’t new. Officials have long recognized the threat. \"This is the most dangerous river valley in the United States,\" Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly said Friday. In May 2016, Sheriff Rusty Hierholzer put it bluntly during a commissioners court meeting. \"Unfortunately, Guadalupe River is one of the most prone to flooding -- flash flooding areas in the nation,\" Hierholzer said. That same year, Kerr County partnered with the City of Kerrville and the Upper Guadalupe River Authority. They formed a flood warning steering committee, spent $50,000 on an engineering study, and applied for a $1 million state grant to install sirens and river gauges. But that grant was denied in 2018. \"We were not successful—bottom line,\" Moser said. \"I don't think it would have saved everybody. It would have helped probably a lot of people... but it wouldn't have been 100% effective.” For Moser, this isn’t just policy—it’s personal. \"A good friend of mine owns Camp Mystic, and he perished in this thing,\" he said. Camp Director Dick Eastland died trying to save campers. \"It was not surprising that he perished doing what he was doing,\" one person said. Some have also questioned whether the National Weather Service gave enough warning ....",

KBR would like to thank Mr. Bright for his 15 years of dedicated service. He has been an integral part of KBR’s transformation and success, and we wish him well in his next chapter. In January 2025, KBR announced a realignment of its portfolio into two business segments, Mission Technology Solutions (MTS) and Sustainable Technology Solutions (STS). In connection with this realignment, Mr. Bright moved into the COO role from his previous position as President of MTS, and the company appointed new leadership for the MTS business segment. Doug Hill became President of KBR’s Readiness & Sustainment business, and Mark Kavanaugh became President of KBR’s Defense, Intel and Space portfolio globally. Mr. Hill and Mr. Kavanaugh have each served in multiple executive leadership positions at KBR for over eight years, are members of KBR’s Executive Leadership Team and will now report directly to the CEO alongside Jay Ibrahim, President of KBR’s STS business. As a result of Messrs. Hill and Kavanaugh’s leading MTS, KBR expects no operational disruption in the MTS business or the broader KBR portfolio as a result of Mr. Bright’s departure. \"We wish Byron the very best for the future, and I personally would like to thank him for all he has contributed to KBR,\" said Stuart Bradie, KBR...",

U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Tom Barrack, who is also a special envoy to Syria, told The Associated Press after meetings in Damascus, the Syrian capital, that there are still significant differences between the two sides. Barrack held talks with Mazloum Abdi, head of the Kurdish-led and U.S. backed Syrian Democratic Forces, and Syria’s interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa. The development comes after a move by the Trump administration took effect this week, revoking a terrorism designation of the former insurgent group led by al-Sharaa, which was behind a lightning offensive last December that ousted Syria's longtime autocrat Bashar Assad . Revoking the designation was part of a broader U.S. engagement with al-Sharaa's new, transitional government. In early March, the former insurgents — now the new authorities in Damascus — signed a landmark deal with the SDF, a Kurdish-led force that had fought alongside U.S. troops against the militant Islamic State group and which controls much of northeastern Syria.

(AP) — A new lawsuit seeking to redraw Wisconsin’s congressional district boundary lines was filed on Tuesday, less than two weeks after the state Supreme Court declined to hear a pair of other lawsuits that asked for redistricting before the 2026 election.The latest lawsuit brought by a bipartisan coalition of business leaders was filed in Dane County circuit court, rather than directly with the state Supreme Court as the rejected cases were. The justices did not give any reason for declining to hear those cases, but typically lawsuits start in a lower court and work their way up.This new lawsuit’s more lengthy journey through the courts might not be resolved in time to order new maps before the 2026 midterms.Related ArticlesMan accused of Trump assassination attempt in Florida seeks to remove defense attorneys from caseRepublicans urge US universities to cut ties with Chinese-backed scholarship programSupreme Court keeps hold on Florida immigration law aimed at people in the US illegallySenate confirms new FAA administrator at a time of rising concern about air safetyTrump administration sues California over transgender athlete policiesThe Wisconsin Business Leaders for Democracy argue in the new lawsuit that Wisconsin’s congressional maps are unconstitutional because they are an anti-competitive gerrymander.

Peper, a Reedsburg resident, reportedly fell from the tailgate of a pickup truck onto a roadway on Dix Lane in Cazenovia on Friday, according to the Richland County Sheriff's Office. There was no information regarding if the truck was moving or parked, with the department reporting that witnesses were largely unwilling to speak with deputies about the incident. First responders from Cazenovia and Reedsburg, as well as UW MedFlight and the Wisconsin State Patrol, arrived at the scene, but lifesaving efforts were unsuccessful and Peper was pronounced dead. The incident is still under investigation, and the Richland County Sheriff's Office believes there are more people with information. Charges are pending in the case, but the department did not specify the nature of those charges nor the names of people being charged.

Deputies attempted to use stop sticks to end the pursuit but the vehicle evaded law enforcement. Wilson County Sheriff's Office deputies ultimately terminated the chase for public safety reasons. The Pitt County Sheriff's Office said that shortly after the chase was terminated, a deputy located the suspect vehicle at Dollar General, 4706 Stantonsburg Road, near the Southwest Bypass and I-587. A man matching the driver's description was also seen walking away from the area. Deputies canvassed the area and located the suspect, later identified as Christopher Ramon Bautista-Medina, 19, of Wilson, who fled on foot. He was apprehended after a brief foot chase and taken into custody. Bautista-Medina was turned over to the Wilson County Sheriff's Office and transported back to Wilson County, where he was charged with felony flee to elude arrest. Pitt County deputies also charged him with resist, delay or obstruct a public officer. That charge was served in Wilson County. The Mustang was seized under North Carolina state law. 3400 block Tobba Court, 8:30 a.m. July 2: man defrauded of $20,000; case active. 4000 block Emma Cannon Road,...",

        "content": "The US housing market continues to struggle, with 2024 sales of existing homes reaching a 30-year low and affordability remaining a major challenge for many potential buyers. Although the most recent data shows some signs of improvement in selected measures, other problems are persisting. Let’s hit a few high points. May sales of existing homes across the nation were up slightly compared to April (on a seasonally adjusted basis) but were down compared to last May. Sales of new homes were also down. Uncertainty across the economy is one factor giving buyers pause, but the other major issue is high cost due to prices, interest rates, and escalating insurance rates. Prior to the pandemic, median sales price levels for US homes were trending in the $325,000-$350,000 range. Beginning in early 2020, however, prices surged as people sought larger homes and changed geographic locations in response to COVID-19. By late 2022, the median sales price reached $442,600. Though down to $416,900 most recently (somewhat higher for new homes), it remains a major escalation in just a few years’ time. Part two of the affordability problem is interest rates. The Federal Reserve responded to the pandemic with low interest rates, and mortgage rates were below 3% for much of 2020 and 2021. As conditions changed and inflation became a major problem, the Fed pushed interest rates up quickly, and mortgage rates topped 7% by late 2022 and were even higher at points in time.

An Israeli official said an outstanding issue in the negotiations was Israel's desire to keep forces in the territory during a 60-day truce, including in the east-west axis that Israel calls the Morag corridor. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to talk with the media about the negotiations. Keeping a foothold in the Morag corridor is a key element in Israel's plan to drive hundreds of thousands of Palestinians south toward a narrow swath of land along the border with Egypt, into what it has termed a “humanitarian city.” Critics fear the move is a precursor to the coerced relocation of much of Gaza's population of some 2 million people, and part of the Israeli government's plans to maintain lasting control over the territory. Hamas, which still holds dozens of hostages and refuses calls by Israel to surrender, wants Israel to withdraw all of its troops as part of any permanent truce. It is adamantly opposed to any lasting Israeli presence inside Gaza. As part of the proposed truce, Israel and Hamas would hold fire for 60 days, during which time some hostages would be freed and more aid would enter Gaza. Previous demands by Israel to maintain troops in a separate corridor stalled progress on a ceasefire deal for months. The office of...",

        "content": "Please, let this be the last time. The Scott Frost-Nebraska saga returned to the headlines on a hot summer day in July. It’s not exactly the gift that keeps on giving. It’s more like the sunburn that won’t go away. It’s time for Frost to move on from Nebraska. Likewise, Nebraska. Of course, Nebraskans were minding their own offseason on Tuesday when Frost dragged them unwittingly into the fray while at Big 12 media days. It was Frost’s first big media session since he returned to UCF. You expected that he would be asked about Nebraska. And maybe his answer should have been expected, too. Asked by The Athletic what he learned from his four-plus years at NU, Frost said, “Don’t take the wrong job.” It’s a quote that will forever follow him in his home state. Apparently getting paid $25 million (to go 16-31) and having carte blanche to do things his way is the definition of the wrong job. Now it comes out that Frost was \"tugged\" to help his alma mater and didn’t really want to take the job.

        "content": "Please, let this be the last time. The Scott Frost-Nebraska saga returned to the headlines on a hot summer day in July. It’s not exactly the gift that keeps on giving. It’s more like the sunburn that won’t go away. It’s time for Frost to move on from Nebraska. Likewise, Nebraska. Of course, Nebraskans were minding their own offseason on Tuesday when Frost dragged them unwittingly into the fray while at Big 12 media days. It was Frost’s first big media session since he returned to UCF. You expected that he would be asked about Nebraska. And maybe his answer should have been expected, too. Asked by The Athletic what he learned from his four-plus years at NU, Frost said, “Don’t take the wrong job.” It’s a quote that will forever follow him in his home state. Apparently getting paid $25 million (to go 16-31) and having carte blanche to do things his way is the definition of the wrong job. Now it comes out that Frost was \"tugged\" to help his alma mater and didn’t really want to take the job. As I recall, he was not dragged in kicking and screaming when Bill Moos introduced him back in 2017. There was truth to what Frost said on Tuesday. But it wasn’t the whole truth. Frost came off as bitter. He did not come off as self-aware or a man claiming responsibility to his 16-31 era in Lincoln. He's always been blunt and a lightning rod.

After a five-day trial, a jury convicted 46-year-old Kenyan Roshad Warren of vehicular homicide, driving under the influence and reckless aggravated assault in the 2022 crash, according to the office of District Attorney General Charme Allen. Information about Warren’s legal representation was not immediately available. Warren was driving down the road in Knoxville on Aug. 6, 2022, when he struck two pedestrians who were crossing the street, prosecutors said in a news release July 8. According to police reports , a woman identified as Stephanie Llewellyn died of injuries from Warren’s pickup truck , WVLT and WATE reported. A man had serious injuries, including a major skull fracture, according to prosecutors. Witnesses said before police got to the crash scene, Warren got out of his truck and walked over to Llewellyn, who was lying in the road, according to prosecutors. Witnesses recounted he kicked her, telling her to get up, then cursed at her and tried to drag her to the side of the road, prosecutors said. When officers arrived, they said Warren threw a beer can under his vehicle in front of them. “Warren smelled like alcohol, had bloodshot eyes and was unsteady on his feet,” prosecutors said. A mandatory blood draw revealed his blood alcohol content was .106, and he tested positive for cocaine and...",

The Valkyries held Clark to just 10 points on 4-of-12 shooting as the Fever scored their second-fewest points of the season. Clark returned after missing the past five games with a left groin injury. The All-Star captain participated in practice Monday — the first time she’d done that since getting hurt on June 26. Golden State led 41-32 at halftime and Kate Martin scored five consecutive points in the third for a 15-point lead. After Indiana went on a 10-1 run to get within 55-50, Burton ended Golden State’s drought with a 3-pointer. Burton also capped Golden State’s 9-0 run on another 3-pointer with 26 seconds left in the third for a 64-50 lead. Burton’s fifth 3-pointer, setting a career high, came with 6:32 remaining for a 70-53 lead and Thornton's wide-open 3 about a minute later made it a 20-point lead. Golden State (10-9) went 12 of 32 from 3-point range, compared to 6 of 27 for Indiana. Kelsey Mitchell also struggled for Indiana (9-10), going 3 of 13 for 12 points. Makayla Timpson added 10 points off the bench. The Valkyries beat the Fever 88-77 in the first regular-season meeting on June 19.

Musiala was flown back to Munich on Sunday for surgery on the injury that Bayern said was “associated with an ankle dislocation.” Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer had criticized Donnarumma for his action, suggesting his Italian counterpart “didn’t necessarily have to go in like that” and that he had knowingly risked causing an injury. Bayern board member for sport Max Eberl also criticized Donnarumma, saying there was a “big danger something can happen” with the goalkeeper jumping in to secure the ball and that the action was “not without risk.” Donnarumma, who was visibly upset after seeing Musiala’s injury, posted a message tagged to Musiala: “All my prayers and well wishes are with you.” Musiala appeared to address Neuer and Eberl’s criticisms. “The surgery went really well, I’m in good care, and I wanted to say there’s no one to blame for this,” the 22-year-old forward said. “I think situations like this happen and now I’m just going to...",

It's not a tournament where surprises tend to happen. This week, the likes of Nelly Korda and Jeeno Thitikul will try to add their own chapters to this brief history as the championship begins Thursday at Evian Resort in Evian-les-Bains, France. World No. 1 Korda is still searching for her first win of 2025 after collecting seven titles in 2024. Thailand's Thitikul, ranked No. 2 in the world, has yet to win a major and is coming off a frustrating Women's PGA Championship, where she led each of the first two rounds before fading to a tie for fourth. Still, Thitikul is only 22 years old and will have more opportunities. The 26-year-old Korda joked this week that she doesn't recognize half the players on tour this year. \"I feel like a grandma out here,\" Korda said. \"But, yeah, that's the best thing about sports in general, is that you can never stay comfortable where you are because there is a new generation, new talent coming, and they're going to be better and have more knowledge.\" It's not strictly a young woman's game. Australia's Minjee Lee -- who at 29 qualifies as a tour veteran -- broke a 20-month title drought when she charged past Thitikul on the weekend to win the Women's PGA, her third career major. \"I feel like there is so many that are so young now and that are so good,\" Lee said. \"They're always pushing me and pushing all of us older...",

        "content": "For many Australians, the idea of generating a second income without clocking in for a second job sounds too good to be true.But with the right investment strategy, it is possible to turn a carefully built portfolio into a reliable income stream.It is even possible to build one that could deliver $2,000 a month and support your lifestyle for years to come.So, how do you get there using ASX shares? It takes a combination of planning, patience, and a firm grasp of the power of dividend investing.Start with the end in mindFirst, let's reverse-engineer the goal. To generate $2,000 a month — or $24,000 a year — from dividends, you will need a sizeable portfolio.Assuming an average dividend yield of 5%, which is easily achievable on the Australian share market, you will need a portfolio valued at around $480,000 to pull in the targeted passive income.That certainly is no small sum. But the point here is not to have it all right now — it is about building toward that goal gradually over time.The power of compoundingLet's say you're starting with $50,000 and can invest an additional $1,000 a month. With an average annual total return of 10%, your portfolio could grow to $480,000 in approximately 13 years.What's doing most of the heavy lifting in this scenario isn't the $1,000 deposits you are making into ASX shares — it's the compounding that is happening year after year.Building a portfolioBuilding a passive income stream isn't about chasing the highest-yielding stocks.

The death toll on Wednesday stood at 111 with 161 still unaccounted for, according to Abbott. At least 27 children from Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' camp along the Guadalupe River, were killed, with several campers and one counselor still missing. Many of the victims are from the Houston area. Hundreds of searchers and cadaver dogs are working around the clock to look for the missing to bring some sense of closure to the families. They include Texas EquuSearch. \"Texas has sustained a devastating and heartbreaking loss as a result of the recent flooding events across the state. Countless lives have been lost during this horrific event, and an unbelievable amount of physical and emotional damage has been sustained throughout the state,\" Abbott said in a statement. \"It is therefore fitting that flags be lowered to half-staff to assist in mourning, remembrance, and recovery from this terrible disaster.\" Abbott requested that flags be returned to full staff at sunrise on Monday, July 14. Individuals, businesses, and other political subdivisions and entities are encouraged to fly their flags at half-staff for the same length of time as a mark of respect and remembrance. \"On behalf of Texas, the First Lady and I offer our thoughts and prayers on behalf families and survivors during their time of mourning and recovery,\" Abbott said.

        "content": "If you want to turn $5,000 into $50,000, the Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) could be one of your best tools to get there. The TFSA allows you to invest completely tax-free. As a result, you can compound your capital at faster rates than anywhere else.Maximize long-term returns by using the TFSA and picking great stocksTo turn $5,000 into $50,000 in 10 years, you would need to earn a 26% compounded annual return. That is a pretty aggressive rate of return given that the TSX Index has only delivered a 9% compounded annual total return over the long term.If you increased your investing horizon to 20 years, you would only need a 12% compounded rate of return to 10 times your $5,000. That rate of return might be more attainable for many investors.An industrial stock ideal for compoundingHowever, in several instances, the 10 years-to-10X timeframe was attainable. TerraVest Industries (TSX:TVK) is a perfect example.It 10Xâd in just over five years. TVK stock has compounded by a 57% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past five years and a 38% CAGR over the past 10 years.Given its substantial returns, investors would be surprised at what TerraVest does. It operates an industrial conglomerate focused on specialized tank and trailer manufacturing, boiler production, and energy services. There is nothing exciting about these businesses.However, what is exciting is TerraVestâs ability to smartly acquire cheap businesses, drastically improve operational and financial...",

        "content": "The AI chip stocks have come a long way since getting rocked in the first half of the year. But lately, all of the names have been blasting off past prior all-time highs. Some names, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), are down and seem poised to stay down for a rather lengthy period of time. Indeed, the iPhone maker isn’t necessarily what comes to mind when one thinks of an AI chip firm. However, with an impressive neural engine in its latest and greatest silicon, the company has a significant amount of AI hardware firepower up its sleeve.Arguably, if the maker of Macs, iPhones, and iPads can get things right with AI software (think the LLM-powered Siri that simply cannot land soon enough), it may have what it takes to really feel more of that AI tailwind. So far this year, though, Apple stock hasn’t really felt the same wind at its back as most other firms in AI hardware and software have. Either way, I think Apple stands out as a fairly attractive catch-up trade for those looking for a relative bargain in the AI scene.Apple stock is in a painful spot. But don’t discount its AI chip prowess.At the time of this writing, shares of AAPL are still down 19% at a time when the mega-caps are either at new highs or are in the process of making a full recovery from the recent rut they found themselves in just a few short months ago. In any case, I think Apple stock stands out as a great buy as it readies its latest and greatest iPhones with chips that may very well better position itself...",

        "content": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Ángel Correa is leaving Atlético Madrid after 10 years to join Tigres UANL in Mexico’s Liga MX. Both clubs announced Wednesday they had agreed a deal for the right winger. The 30-year-old Argentine scored 88 goals with 65 assists in 469 matches with Atletico, where he helped the team win the Spanish league title in the 2020-21 season and reach the final of the Champions League in 2016. His last appearance for Atletico was at the Club World Cup, where the team failed to advance from its group. Tigres, which plays home matches in Monterrey, north Mexico, did not reveal details of the agreement. It said Correa arrived in Mexico on Wednesday to have a medical, ahead of signing a contract. Correa was a member of the Argentina squad that won the World Cup in 2022 and the Copa America in 2021. Correa also won the Europa League and the Europa Super Cup in 2018 with Atlético. Tigres has won eight league titles. AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention count, updated Wednesday, is 14 more cases than in all of 2019, when the U.S. almost lost its status of having eliminated measles. There've been three deaths in the U.S. this year, and all were unvaccinated: two elementary school-aged children in West Texas and an adult in New Mexico . A vast majority of this year's cases are from Texas, where a major outbreak raged through the late winter and spring, but where no new outbreak cases were reported this week. Other states with active outbreaks — which the CDC defines as three or more related cases — include Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas , Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Utah. Missouri confirmed its first outbreak July 3. North American has three other large outbreaks . The longest, in Ontario, Canada, has resulted in 2,223 cases from mid-October through July 2. The province logged its first death June 5 in a baby who got congenital measles but also had other preexisting conditions. Another outbreak in Alberta, Canada, has sickened 1,246 as of Wednesday .

From the clinic, a “19-year-old male was transported by Killeen EMS to Baylor Scott & White in stable condition. Preliminary investigation revealed that the victim and two other males were inside a vehicle in the 4900 block of Bridgewood Drive when they saw a male across the street retrieve a handgun from his hoodie and fire at them,” KPD said in response to questions from Herald “The group immediately fled the area and then realized one of them had been shot. Responding officers obtained surveillance video showing the suspect running into a nearby residence. Officers on scene began issuing commands to the suspect, who initially refused to come out. After repeated attempts, two male juveniles exited the residence and were detained without incident.”",

The incident occurred following B.C.’s 21-20 road win over the Montreal Alouettes on Saturday night, which ended on Sean Whyte’s 43-yard field goal. Turay and Montreal defensive lineman Isaac Adeyemi-Berglund became involved in an altercation outside the Alouettes’ locker room, prompting others to join in. Turay received a one-game ban for committing a non-football act — inciting a post-game altercation. Adeyemi-Berglund and Montreal’s M.J. Sherman received fines for committing a non-football act — engaging in a post-game altercation — while Alouettes offensive lineman Pier-Olivier Lestage was also fined for making inappropriate contact with a TSN camera operator. CFL commissioner Stewart Johnston oversees suspendible offences, while discipline is handled by the league’s department of health, safety and integrity. The department includes chief football operations officer Greg Dick, vice-president of officiating Darren Hackwood, associate vice-president of football operations Ryan Janzen and associate vice-president of health and safety Eric Noivo. “Non-football acts negatively impact the reputation and professional standing of the CFL and they will not be tolerated,” Johnston said in a statement. “These actions do not reflect the values of our league. “The post-game altercation in Montreal became an...",

        "content": "TORONTO - The CFL on Wednesday suspended B.C. Lions defensive lineman Kemoko Turay for one game and fined three others for their roles in a post-game altercation last week. The incident occurred following B.C.’s 21-20 road win over the Montreal Alouettes on Saturday night, which ended on Sean Whyte’s 43-yard field goal. Turay and Montreal defensive lineman Isaac Adeyemi-Berglund became involved in an altercation outside the Alouettes’ locker room, prompting others to join in. Turay received a one-game ban for committing a non-football act — inciting a post-game altercation. Adeyemi-Berglund and Montreal’s M.J. Sherman received fines for committing a non-football act — engaging in a post-game altercation — while Alouettes offensive lineman Pier-Olivier Lestage was also fined for making inappropriate contact with a TSN camera operator. CFL commissioner Stewart Johnston oversees suspendible offences, while discipline is handled by the league’s department of health, safety and integrity. The department includes chief football operations officer Greg Dick, vice-president of officiating Darren Hackwood, associate vice-president of football operations Ryan Janzen and associate vice-president of health and safety Eric Noivo. “Non-football acts negatively impact the reputation and professional standing of the CFL and they will not be tolerated,” Johnston said in a statement. “These actions do not reflect the values of our league. “The post-game altercation in Montreal became an...",

A researcher says this raises concerns about replacing American workers and the use of taxpayer dollars. According to MyVisaJobs, a site where immigrants explore U.S. work visa opportunities, 89 Rivian positions are listed in Normal, many in common tech roles like software developers and product managers. “If Rivian said, ‘these 25 engineers are the best in the world, and only they can design this specific part of the truck,’ that would make sense under the H-1B program. But that’s clearly not what’s happening at this scale,” said Simon Hankinson, a senior researcher at The Heritage Foundation. “The same goes for Microsoft—filing over 6,000 petitions isn’t about unique talent, it’s mass labor recruitment and replacement.” The 2,000 H-1B and 400 green card applications filed do not necessarily reflect the actual number of foreign workers hired, as some visa requests may be denied. Additionally, workers renewing, transferring or changing locations often require new labor condition applications. Hankinson’s research shows most H-1B positions pay below the median wage, with only one in six reaching the top wage tier. “This program was created 30 years ago to bring in a limited number of specialty workers during shortages,” said Hankinson. “Now it’s being used as a cheap labor pipeline to replace American workers.”...",

Un funcionario israelí dijo que un tema pendiente en las negociaciones es el deseo de Israel de mantener a sus fuerzas en el territorio durante una tregua de 60 días, incluido el eje este-oeste que Tel Aviv denomina el corredor de Morag. El funcionario habló bajo condición de anonimato porque no estaba autorizado a hablar con los medios sobre las negociaciones. Mantener una presencia en el corredor de Morag es un elemento clave en el plan de Israel para trasladar a cientos de miles de palestinos al sur, hacia una estrecha franja de tierra a lo largo de la frontera con Egipto, en lo que ha denominado una “ciudad humanitaria”. Los críticos temen que la medida sea un precursor de la reubicación forzada de gran parte de la población de Gaza, de aproximadamente 2 millones de personas, que forma parte de los planes del gobierno israelí para mantener un control duradero sobre el territorio. Hamás, que aún retiene a docenas de rehenes y se niega a los llamados de Israel a rendirse, quiere que Tel Aviv retire todas sus tropas como parte de cualquier tregua permanente.

        "content": "During a multiday trip on the Indian Ocean off the coast of Sri Lanka, a fishing vessel reeled in a rare, massive creature trapped in a tuna gill net. With it measuring over 8 feet long with a “silvery-grey” body and “crimson red” fins, researchers have now confirmed the specimen caught accidentally in 2021 was an oarfish — the longest bony fish in the world, according to a study published July 9 in the journal Acta Ichthyologica Et Piscatoria. This is the first confirmed sighting of the species Regalecus russellii in Sri Lankan waters, according to researchers. Just two oarfish of this species have been recorded in the Indian Ocean, the study said. Oarfish in the Regalecidae family are known for their “extremely slender” and “very elongated ribbon-like” bodies, according to the study. They inhabit a wide range of depths from just below the ocean surface to the mesopelagic zone, or twilight zone, where very little light penetrates, researchers said. According to the study, oarfish are associated with “numerous mythological beliefs,” but very little is known about them from a scientific standpoint, particularly in terms of their biology and habitat. Oarfish are often referred to as “ doomsday fish ” because in some cultures they are seen as “harbingers of bad news, particularly disasters or destruction,” such as earthquakes, according to the Ocean Conservancy. In the months leading up to Japan’s Great Tōhoku Earthquake in 2011, 20 oarfish were found on beaches, according to...",

Greg Abbott said the state had “assets, resources and personnel” in place two days before a flood tore through the Hill Country. “The state was aware that there was a possible serious flooding event days in advance and pre-positioned assets and resources and personnel,” Abbott said at a Tuesday press conference. “We originally pre-positioned those assets, personnel and resources on Wednesday. Then, when greater clarity was discerned on Wednesday, we moved them closer and made sure we had adequate supplies going into Friday. We were ready.” The Texas Division of Emergency Management “activated” state emergency response resources across West Texas and the Hill Country on July 2, according to a TDEM press release. TDEM cited “heavy rainfall with the potential to cause flash flooding” and encouraged Texans to prepare for flooded roads and monitor weather forecasts. The state agency listed a number of state agencies and Texas A&M services “available to support local flood response operations,” such as rescue boat teams, helicopters, and personnel to monitor road conditions. Kerrville Mayor Joe Herring said during a press conference on Wednesday that he wasn’t aware of any resources or personnel sent to his area, although the TDEM had people in Kerrville after the floods struck his city. “I haven't seen the governor’s remarks ...

But among certain congressional colleagues, at least, the Washington Democrat is unique in that belief. Gluesenkamp Perez Gluesenkamp Perez spoke with CNN’s Jake Tapper this week about an amendment she’d proposed seeking to set ethics guidelines for Congress members’ cognitive keenness. It failed. Last week, Gluesenkamp Perez’s counterparts on the House Appropriations Committee slapped it down. The lawmaker told Tapper in a July 2 segment that she’s fielded concerns from constituents who worry that congressional staff members are the ones actually behind the wheel of the federal government. Although the amendment pertains to members of Congress, Tapper said that former President Joe Biden also had showed signs of cognitive decline while still in office. The CNN host gave Gluesenkamp Perez props for urging Biden to “do what he knows is right for the country and put the national interest first” last year as he sought to secure another term. Gluesenkamp Perez — whose district includes Clark, Cowlitz, Lewis, Pacific, Skamania and Wahkiakum counties, plus some of south Thurston County — said she’d heard from constituents with such concerns. “What I heard at home was: ‘Is this person the one steering the ship?’” she said. “It’s about the office itself, it’s about the loyalty to your district, and a commitment to real, effective representation and...",

Linebacker Bob Nelson (1972-74 letterwinner) enters as a veteran inductee while UNO linebacker Tom Sutko (1978-80 letterwinner) is this year’s state college representative. The entity will also celebrate its first Hall of Fame Legend honoree in 1972 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Rodgers, who entered the Nebraska Football Hall of Fame in 1973. Others recognized are Nebraska deputy A.D. Dennis Leblanc (Lyell Bremser Special Merit Award) and longtime team orthopedic surgeon Robert Dugas (Clarence Swanson Memorial Award).

Tudor Dixon, the former Michigan Republican Party nominee for governor who lost to incumbent Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in the 2022 contest, announced Wednesday that she would not run for governor nor the U.S. Senate in 2026. Dixon posted a lengthy statement on social media Wednesday noting her decision to not seek either office in the upcoming election cycle. She was rumored to be interested in seeking the Republican nomination for both positions, which will be decided by voters during the August 2026 primary. The former nominee name-dropped President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance in her explanation of why she would not run for governor again or to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield), saying the pair was “saving America” with policies that she said were having positive effects. pic.twitter.com/RG9A533Utn — Tudor Dixon (@TudorDixon) July 9, 2025 Dixon said her focus was on “protecting and advancing those policies.” That also means voters won’t see her name on primary ballots for either position come August 2026. “I will continue traveling our great state to support Trump polices and the candidates authentically embracing them,” Dixon said. “President Trump’s drive to save our country and be the voice for working people is remarkable.

The cofounding member of the rock band has announced that he is leaving the band for the remainder of the year as he will be recovering from the surgery he is undergoing for his right hand. The surgery is meant to prevent permanent damage from his right hand. In a joint Instagram post with the Fall Out Boy's official page and Joe's on Monday (July 7), he announced and explained the reason for his impending absence and his ongoing health troubles. \"Hey everyone, after years of managing ongoing issues with my right hand, it’s become clear that I need surgery to avoid permanent damage,\" Joe wrote. \"Unfortunately, this means I’ll have to take the rest of the year off from playing with the band. The silver lining is that I’m on track for a full recovery.\" \"The band will still be playing all scheduled shows. I'm looking forward to recovering so I can get back out there with the guys. Thank you so much for the love and support,\" he concluded. This is the 40 year-old's second time taking a temporary break from the band. Joe took an unspecified break at the time from Fall Out Boy in January 2023 for mental health reasons. He elaborated that he was concentrating on his mental health. At the time, Joe had shared a screenshot message on X formerly Twitter and wrote in part, \"Neil Young once howled that it’s better to burn out than to fade away.

When military personnel travel with their scuba equipment, they require specialized gear that balances durability, functionality, and portability. Unlike civilian divers who prioritize comfort and simplicity, military divers need equipment that can withstand extreme conditions while maintaining tactical advantages like stealth and operational flexibility.

Under the exception, municipalities can use the future growth in property tax revenue generated within the district solely to cover data center-related costs, The Center Square previously reported . Evers and lawmakers alike hope the act will incentivize companies to build data centers in both cities. “Wisconsin’s tech industry is growing and bringing with it countless family-supporting jobs, economic development opportunities, and substantial capital investments in our local communities,” Evers said in a statement. “This bill will help these two communities compete for new data centers, bolster our local communities, and build upon our work to build a 21st-century workforce and economy.” A planned data center in Port Washington is expected to be built and could open before the end of the year.

The latest is a cartoon published by the Buffalo News, which Erie County, NY, GOP Chairman Michael Kracker says should be taken down immediately. The Buffalo News cartoon depicts a white man wearing a red MAGA hat drowning holding a sign that says, “help,” while also saying, “the government is the problem not the solution.” “The Buffalo News ran a cartoon mocking Texas families who lost loved ones in a tragedy, just because they might’ve voted Republican. Twisted, vile, and shameful. They owe those families an apology and should pull this filth immediately,” Kracker said on X. Prior to that, two women in Houston appeared to wish death on flood victims because of their perceived political affiliations, including targeting deceased children. They were both fired. Houston’s Democratic Mayor John Whitmire continues to denounce such claims, expressing compassion for flood victims. More than 30 confirmed dead and missing are children, including several from Houston. At a city council meeting on Tuesday, Whitmire called for the city “to unite in mourning and recognize how blessed we all are to be with our families, our grandchildren when people are suffering such unimaginable loss.” Houston Fire Department swift water and search and recovery teams are...",

My question on Wednesday, during Gundy’s Big 12 Media Days appearance at The Star complex, was this: what is the Oklahoma State coach’s level of confidence in his new assistants’ ability to actually coach? As last season was a winless-in-Big 12-play debacle for the Cowboy program, how does Gundy feel about his retooled staff’s ability to pull a winning result from a rebuilt roster? “Defensively, there was an adjustment for me,” Gundy said. “I didn’t know any of these guys. You hire a new coordinator (Todd Grantham) and he brings in his guys (position coaches). So, when I was watching during the spring, it was as new for me as it is for you.” People are also reading...

        "content": "NEW YORK — Mayor Eric Adams is no longer looking for the possibility of jail time for offenders of his proposed mask ban — a step back amid concerns from key stakeholders, including NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch, who is otherwise supportive of tougher restrictions on face coverings, according to sources familiar with the matter. Under a state law enacted this year, individuals can face additional penalties if they’re caught wearing a face covering while committing a crime. But First Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro and other members of Adams’ team have in recent weeks approached City Council members about introducing a bill that’d make covering your face at a public gathering, such as a protest, illegal, sources told the Daily News. Until recently, the proposal Adams’ team has pushed would make mask wearing in such scenarios punishable by fines and even jail time, though there would be some sort of carveout for health reasons, said the sources. In advocating for a beefed-up ban, Adams has zeroed in on pro-Palestinian protests in the city, where demonstrators often cover their faces. Adams, who has made combating antisemitism a key focus of his bid for reelection, says the state-level restrictions adopted this year aren’t enough, arguing they still embolden protesters to wear masks to engage in criminal activity. Adams spokeswoman Kayla Mamelak confirmed Wednesday the threat of jail time is not part of the mask ban proposal under discussion. She didn’t say specifically what...",

Jean Parvin Bordewich, Guilford College's interim president, announces Wednesday that the college's latest fundraising campaign raised $6 million, $1 million over its goal. Raising the $5 million for the \"For the Good of Guilford\" campaign was one of two things the private college founded by Quakers would need to maintain its accreditation. The second is a balanced 2026 fiscal year budget by fall, and that has led to difficult questions about possible staff layoffs and cuts to programs. The college is currently on probation with its accrediting body, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACS), in connection with financial troubles dating back to 2020. The probation was initially imposed in 2023 and the school was given a one-year extension in December. Jean Parvin Bordewich, Guilford College's interim president, said more cost-cutting steps are needed at the college. Bordewich has spent the past six months assessing the college's strengths and assets to help address the college’s serious financial problems. As a result, she said after making the fundraising announcement at a press conference on the steps of Founders Hall, that the school had offered early retirement and severance to employees and then laid off eight people...",

But through noon on Wednesday, none of those passersby had voted in the runoff to choose either Peter Hubbard or Keisha Waites as the Democratic nominee for a seat on Georgia’s Public Service Commission. Welcome to a statewide election where almost nobody came . Through the first two of five days of early in-person voting, only 9,822 ballots were accepted. That's 0.13% of active voters, what Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer for Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, called “miserably low turnout.” Early in-person voting runs through Friday, with the election day set for Tuesday. Anyone can vote, except for the more than 63,000 people who voted in Republican primaries on June 17 including one in which incumbent Tim Echols beat GOP challenger Lee Muns. Waites was the top vote-getter in a June 17 Democratic primary, but didn't get a majority. That meant she had to face the second-place finisher, Hubbard, in a runoff to determine the party nominee. Barring an upswell in voter numbers, fewer than 1% of Georgia's 7.4 million active voters could cast ballots. The winner will go on to face Republican incumbent Fitz Johnson in November....",

After being the star of a Mokena shelter since 2023, he finally thought he found a home, only to be left behind a short time later. But now, nearly 1,000 days after his first arrival, the Staffordshire terrier with ears like his namesake, Yoda, really has found the family he deserves. On July 5, NAWS Humane Society of Illinois posted a lighthearted video on Facebook, showing the excited 5-year-old pup with his new family. The shelter said one of the reasons it took so long to find a family that stuck was because he’s not that social with other animals. “When Yoda first came to NAWS, it became apparent he wasn’t the most social dog,” NAWS shelter director Victoria Swyndroski told Patch.com . “He liked some dogs, but not 100 percent. Not a fan of kitties—he’s a prey-driven little guy.” Prey-driven, yes, but he also is known for his personality, the shelter noted in a May 28 post that celebrated his birthday. “Yoda knows his basic commands,” the post said. “Yoda is loyal. Yoda just wants to give you ALL the love. Yet at the end of the day.. he goes back into his create crying waiting for someone to open their home to him. He deserves so much (more) than shelter life.” Yoda was adopted in 2024 by a woman from Wisconsin, but he was later abandoned by her after he managed to break away, the shelter told Patch. “He had gotten away from her on a walk, and she couldn’t catch him,” Swyndroski said to the outlet....",

At 11 p.m. Tuesday, an officer was out on an unrelated call when he noticed a truck across the street in the Town Pump parking lot, 1370 Harrison Ave., with its door wide open and the driver slumped over. When the officer went to check on the driver, he saw liquor containers in the vehicle. He then woke up Shayleah D.

The firm anticipates robust growth in Alphabet’s core digital advertising segments, particularly in Search and YouTube, despite uncertainties related to global trade and tariffs.The target price indicates an 11% upside from Tuesday’s closing price. According to TD Cowen, Alphabet is expected to post 12.7% year-over-year net revenue growth in Q2, 5.4% above the current consensus estimate. The firm also projects that Alphabet’s operating income and earnings per share (EPS) will exceed consensus by 5.5% and 4.6%, respectively. These projections are backed by a digital advertising expert call hosted by TD Cowen on July 2, which indicated continued strength in Google Search performance into the summer months.Consumer behavior has remained resilient, further supporting optimism around Alphabet’s advertising business, which remains a primary revenue driver.Generative AI and strategic developments in focusIn addition to expected financial outperformance, investors are paying close attention to Alphabet’s ongoing investments in artificial intelligence (AI).

At least 30 hectares of township land are required for additional employment lands and to guide future planning decisions. While land Option D , which is 92.98 hectares and located immediately south of Highway 401 and east of Concession Road 7, is currently recommended for Puslinch’s future short-term employment growth, the president of NPG Planning Solutions, Mary Lou Tanner, said they’ve identified four areas for long-term growth following council recommendations: The founder of the Donkey Sanctuary of Canada at 6981 Concession 4, Sandra, said they feel the decision to reinclude options B and C clouds the study’s overall recommendations and could negatively impact their facility.

Delegating to Puslinch council Wednesday morning with the support of several residents, David and Sandra Pady said they’re concerned that a new proposal to set aside additional rural lands for future employment opportunities outside of what was recommended in April could negatively impact local agricultural operations and interfere with Puslinch’s rural identity. At least 30 hectares of township land are required for additional employment lands and to guide future planning decisions. While land Option D , which is 92.98 hectares and located immediately south of Highway 401 and east of Concession Road 7, is currently recommended for Puslinch’s future short-term employment growth, the president of NPG Planning Solutions, Mary Lou Tanner, said they’ve identified four areas for long-term growth following council recommendations: The founder of the Donkey Sanctuary of Canada at 6981 Concession 4, Sandra, said they feel the decision to reinclude options B and C clouds the study’s overall recommendations and could negatively impact their facility. Operating in Puslinch for over 30 years, Sandra said the sanctuary currently owns two 100-acre farms: one for the donkeys, which was purchased in 2010, and another on the western boundary where hay and straw are produced, which was purchased in 2015.

        "content": "After week’s of speculation, the Edmonton Oilers were officially able to acquire Isaac Howard in a trade with the Tampa Bay Lightning on Tuesday. This is a very intriguing move for the Oilers, as it gives them a young piece who, in the eyes of most, is NHL ready. Immediately after being acquired, the 21-year-old agreed to a three-year entry-level contract. Despite being a big acquisition, however, many are still unfamiliar with Howard, given that he has yet to play in the NHL. With that said, here are seven fun facts about the newest Oiler in order for fans to get to know him better. Hobey Baker winner There is plenty of reason to be excited about the acquisition of Howard, in large part due to the season he had in 2024-25. The 5-foot-11 winger scored a ridiculous 26 goals and 52 points in 37 games with Michigan State University. It was a massive improvement after he managed six and eight goals through his first two seasons at the collegiate level. The strong season was enough to see Howard be named the Hobey Baker winner. There have been some fantastic players who have won the award in recent years, including Macklin Celebrini, Cole Caufield, and Cale Makar. Prefers to go by ‘Ike’ Speaking with Edmonton reporters on Wednesday morning, Howard revealed that rather than going by Isaac, he prefers to be called ‘Ike’.

Так, в странах Ближнего Востока, Северной Африки и даже Южной Европы столбики термометров часто превышают отметку в 40 °C (104°F) . Экстремальная жара может быть смертельно опасной — так, во время европейской волны тепла в 2003 году погибло 30 000 человек, — но такие высокие температуры в течение длительного периода могут также увеличить риск лесных пожаров, которые и так уже вспыхнули в Греции, Испании и США. По данным Межправительственной группы экспертов ООН по изменению климата, волны тепла становятся все более частым явлением из-за антропогенного изменения климата. По словам ученых, экстремально жаркая погода будет случаться чаще и станет еще более интенсивной по мере того, как планета будет продолжать нагреваться. Как справляются со знойным летом в странах мира — смотрите в фоторепортаже Свободной Прессы.",

These are a few of the scores of victims lost in devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country . The flooding originated from the fast-moving waters of the Guadalupe River on Friday, killing more than 100 people. Authorities say search and rescue efforts are still underway, including for campers missing from a summer camp for girls . Renee Smajstrla, a 8-year-old straight-A student from Ingram, Texas, who had played a role in her school's production of “The Wizard of Oz,” was one of the victims who died in the flash floods at Camp Mystic, her family said. Renee had just completed second grade and aspired to play the lead role in an upcoming camp production, according to a funeral home obituary . At school, she played “The Lullaby League” munchkin in “The Wizard of Oz.” “Renee was a great classmate, friend and teammate,” the obituary said. “Being an athlete but a cheerleader at heart, Renee often found herself rooting for both teams.” Her uncle posted a photo on Facebook of Renee smiling at camp the day before the July 4 floods. “She will forever be living her best life at Camp Mystic,” he wrote. Mary Kate Jacobe, an 8-year-old from Houston described by her family as “tiny but mighty,” was a camper at Camp Mystic killed in the July 4 flooding. Jacobe’s family described the girl as having a “smile that melted your heart.” “Mary Kate, our Sissy, was the baby of our...",

        "content": "Under the “one big beautiful bill,” passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump, the typical Concord resident is expected to pay roughly $1,000 less in federal taxes next year, according to an analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. The impact of the plan’s cuts to federal assistance, along with a ballooning federal debt and the rising cost of tariffs, however, is expected to far outweigh those savings. Although some portions of the budget bill target lower earners, like increases to the child tax credit and the elimination of taxes on some tips, the law will deliver the largest tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans — including those living in the Granite State. The U.S. Census estimates that the median Concord resident makes $49,920 a year, putting them in the lower 40% of earners statewide. As the result of the federal budget bill, the bottom 20% of earners in New Hampshire will see a net drop in their taxes of about $200, while the top 1% — those making more than about $895,000 — will have roughly $59,000 taken off their tax bill, according to the analysis. As a share of the overall tax break, the bottom 20% of earners nationwide will receive functionally 0% of the dollar-for-dollar benefit, the institute found. The top 20% will receive 72% of the reduction. “For working-class Americans, the tax cuts in the House bill are extremely modest, and overall taxes would rise for these families when the impact of higher import taxes, or tariffs,...",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — The House Armed Services Committee’s draft National Defense Authorization Act would require the Pentagon to provide Congress with answers about how the department intends to realize President Donald Trump’s proposed Golden Dome antimissile shield over America. The fact that the panel’s fiscal 2026 bill is asking for this information is the latest sign that even the defense oversight committees know little about what Trump’s vision for missile defense might entail. This is the case despite the fact that the reconciliation bill enacted on July 4 appropriates about $25 billion for a variety of antimissile systems, many of which lawmakers said they foresee as part of the Golden Dome architecture. Trump announced the launch of his Golden Dome project in May, but he described it only in broad terms as a way to protect America from missiles launched from anywhere in the world, including by being able to intercept them from U.S. military satellites. Even a less expansive system, if it included space assets, could cost more than $1 trillion, leading experts said. Since Trump’s announcement, the Pentagon has declined to provide the press with more information about Golden Dome, and the department canceled an industry day in June meant to inform contractors of plans. The GOP-led House Appropriations Committee, in the report accompanying its fiscal 2026 Defense spending bill, said the Pentagon has yet to give Congress information about Golden Dome and “what exactly it...",

Bedford was confirmed on a near party-line vote, 53-43. Republicans and industry leaders lauded President Donald Trump's choice of Bedford, citing his experience as CEO of regional airline Republic Airways since 1999. Sen. Ted Cruz , the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, called Bedford a “steady leader with executive experience.” But Democrats and flight safety advocates opposed his nomination, citing Bedford's lack of commitment to the 1,500-hour training requirement for pilots that was put in place by Congress after a 2009 plane crash in New York. Bedford declined during his confirmation hearing to commit to upholding a rule requiring 1,500 hours of training for pilots, saying only that he would not “have anything that will reduce safety.” Sen. Maria Cantwell , the top Democrat on the Commerce panel, accused Bedford of wanting “to roll back safety reforms and unravel the regulatory framework that made the United States the gold standard” in aviation safety. Congress implemented the 1,500-hour rule for pilot training and other safety precautions after the 2009 Colgan Air crash near Buffalo, New York. In that flight, the pilot had not been trained on how to...",

Undeclared allergens and contamination risks were declared in at least five products, with the supermarket giant teaming up with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to remove the products from shelves and warn customers of their danger. Among the most notable of the recalls is Welby Vitamin B12, which contained an undeclared peanut allergen, as well as several food items running the gamut from churro bites to seafood dishes. Customers are being urged to check their pantries for the items in question and return or dispose of them immediately if found. The widespread recalls — both at Aldi and other stores — are just a part of the ongoing challenges highlighted in food safety recently, with undeclared allergens and microbial contaminants posing massive risks to the American public. Even trace amounts of allergens in products can trigger severe allergic reactions in those affected by certain allergies, making recalls crucial. So, what products are being recalled from Aldi? And why? The full list of products being recalled is as follows: The Casa Mamita Chicken & Cheese Taquitos were recalled in association with Bestway Sandwiches Inc. because of possible metal contamination.

The fire was reported around 12:16 p.m., Casper Fire-EMS Capt. Kevin Ross said at the scene. Ross said the cause of the fire wasn't immediately clear and remains under investigation. Authorities reached out to Rocky Mountain Power to determine whether the boxes had been damaged. The brief blaze caused the closure of the westbound lanes of King Boulevard, which were reopened to traffic within an hour. The fire burned the areas around two electrical boxes on the north side of the street. Power to one of the boxes was shut off, but the other was live when the fire was extinguished. A cylinder next to the westmost electrical box appeared somewhat charred but was otherwise visually intact. The fire department sent two type-1 trucks, a type-3 truck and a battalion chief to the scene. Further information was not immediately available Wednesday.",

The briefing was aimed at highlighting the risks associated with do-it-yourself medicine — warning any form of self-diagnosis comes with risks. Many people associate ADHD with childhood — but experts say this isn’t the case as they try to According to a survey from the Canadian Medical Association from January, 62 per cent of Canadians reported seeing health information online before later learning it was misleading or false. That same survey found that 23 per cent of people said they’d experienced negative health reactions after following misleading information found online. “Doctors recognize the complex circumstances that make do-it-yourself treatments appealing,” said Zainab Abdurrahman, OMA president and a clinical immunologist, during Wednesday’s briefing.

Meet Big Rig Burgers: a new floating food truck headed to an Ontario lake near you this summer. A take on a floating tiki bar, Big Rig Burgers is a boat-based food truck made from a modified semi-truck with two delivery windows serving a variety of smash burgers, soft serve ice cream, kettle chips, and dips both on the water and dockside. Based out of Grand Valley, owner Joshua Tuck launched the “one-of-a-kind” pinyon pine big rig boat for the first time from the Highland Pines Campground on Belwood Lake this Sunday, much to the surprise and amusement of many boaters and beachgoers, who pumped their fists or floated up for a bite as the rig motored by. This reaction was the whole reason Tuck wanted to launch Big Rig in the first place. “When I saw the boat for the first time, it was already converted to be a pontoon boat with a transport truck on it, and I thought to myself, ‘Wow, that is so eye-catching, what could I do with that boat?’ And eventually came up with Big Rig Burgers,” said Tuck. “I always thought it would be cool to have a food truck on the water, and it just kept going from there.” It took three months to get the rig water ready. Relatively new to Grand Valley at the time, Tuck said he quickly got to know the entire neighbourhood because everyone wanted to know what was going on with the boat in his driveway. “People had no shame....",

        "content": "Two 17-year-old hikers became separated and got lost deep in the Colorado wilderness — with “no food, no water” and improper gear for the elements. But a K-9 officer was able to track their location in the mountains with additional help from a drone team, officials said. One of the hikers made an S.O.S. call to 911 around 6 p.m. Monday, July 7, saying he had become separated from his friend while hiking, leaving both of them lost and not dressed properly for the elements, Park County Sheriff’s Office said in a post on Facebook. Temperatures dropped into the 40s with strong wind gusts in the area that night, KDVR reported. Several search and rescue parties, including a human tracker and a drone team, set out to search the area, officials said. Rescuers found the missing teens’ car just outside the town of Lake George along a forest service road, and one of Park County’s K–9 officers, Rip, a black German Shepherd, picked up a scent from the car’s door handle and tracked it on the ground. Rip and the drone team found one of the missing hikers just after 9 p.m., officials said. The other hiker was found about four miles away on another trail, officials said. A search and rescue team that had started from the opposite side of the K-9 team found him suffering from dehydration and exhaustion and extracted him out of the mountains. “Both minors were safely reunited with their families and are expected to make a full recovery,” officials said. Several people suggested Rip’s hard work...",

James has been directly involved in 16 goals in her last 13 starts for England, with eight goals and eight assists. Georgia Stanway doubled England’s lead on the stroke of halftime and Ella Toone wrapped up the result in the 67th as the Lionesses gave the perfect response to their 2-1 defeat to France. \"This is about showing who we are,” Stanway told the BBC. “We want to go back to proper England. LJ (Lauren James) set the tone with that goal and we all just followed.” Player-of-the-match Alessia Russo elaborated. “I think proper English to us just means we’ll work hard, we’ll work until we can’t run anymore, we stick together,” she said. \"That’s our standard and our DNA as a team and we definitely saw that today from the first minute right until the end. “(We) probably could have scored even more as well ... it was definitely something that we wanted to return to and we know that we’re capable of performances like that.” It was a far more...",

Now, a New Hampshire Superior Court judge has ruled in favor of Olivia Griffin, who changed her name from Olivia Atkocaitis, by ordering Thomas and Denise Atkocaitis to pay her more than $29.5 million, the amount in damages requested by Griffin. “Ms. Griffin’s testimony was compelling and credible,” reads a July 8 order signed by judge John C. Kissinger Jr. “She testified to the years of abuse the Atkocaitises perpetuated from when she was 14 months old to when she escaped the Atkocaitis home at 15 and a half years old.” Thomas and Denise Atkocaitis represented themselves in the case. They could not immediately be reached for comment. The couple adopted Griffin from China in 2004, McClatchy News previously reported. She fled their New Boston home in 2018, when she successfully dug her way out of the basement, according to her lawsuit. In Kissinger’s order, he wrote that Thomas and Denise Atkocaitis confined Griffin inside a small “8x8 basement room without ventilation” as punishment while isolating her from the local community and preventing her from attending public school. The order says “at one point, the Atkocaitises handcuffed Ms. Griffin’s ankle to a dog leash in the basement room and forced her to use a commode,” which is a...",

Taking to social media Tuesday morning, Anishnabeg Outreach (AO) recently announced it will stop offering delivery for its Spirit Bundle program in August due to funding constraints after scaling back delivery to only those who live far away last year. A program offering bi-weekly deliveries and scheduled pickups of items like food, clothing, feminine hygiene products, pet food and bicycles custom-tailored to individual Indigenous families in the region, AO CEO Stephen Jackson said ending the program wasn’t a choice they wanted to make but one that was necessary to help ensure the program’s overall survival. Impacting approximately 450 Indigenous people living in the Guelph area, the program supports 110 Guelph families, of which it currently delivers to 45. “I can’t say how painful this is,” said Jackson. “We built the solution, we just can’t give it to the people who need it. And now I don’t know how many people we’re not going to be able to feed because they (the bundles) are no longer deliverable.” Jackson said it’s important to offer delivery because many people can’t pick up their bundles as they are elderly, disabled, have a bunch of children, and can’t afford childcare, or can’t access a vehicle. With the final delivery set for July 31, Jackson said each family will receive two more...",

Since opening in 2011, Commonwealth has hosted thousands of musicians and DJs, but now, the space is receiving a head-to-toe refresh. “As we approach 14 years, we’ve taken a moment to reflect and reimagine. A new look, a refined identity, and a deeper commitment to what’s always guided us: music, culture, and community — in the heart of downtown Calgary,” the venue said in an Instagram post. A post shared by Commonwealth Bar & Stage (@commonwealthyyc) As part of the renovations comes the official launch of Common Underground, the lower level of the venue, complete with a slick new bar to free up more space. The Commonwealth will also feature a new immersive LED lighting design, with the stage, as well as its upstairs dance floor, being expanded. The artist’s green rooms will be updated. The VIP sections are set to be enhanced with a larger mezzanine for premium views of the acts. The bathrooms in the venue will also undergo complete renovations. Rounding off the major project will be fresh murals courtesy of Calgary artist XYZ. Commonwealth is owned by Blueprint, one of Western Canada’s largest entertainment companies, which is behind Calgary festivals such as Badlands and Chasing Summer, as well as B.C.’s FVDED in the Park.

Despite efforts to locate it, wildlife officers were unable to find the animal at that time. The next day, Game and Fish received a second report of a black bear near 12th and Taylor.

I'm living lovely. God has truly blessed me. Not a care in the world. Not a want or desire in the world. ... I look good. I'm feeling good.\" Neither Sanders nor Colorado officials have given specifics about the nature of the health issue the coach is facing. He has been away from Boulder, Colo., missing annual youth camps he normally would have attended. When repeatedly asked about his health, Sanders insisted he feels \"good\" and turned the focus to his team. \"I never waver. I never say why me, regardless of what's ahead of me or what I see. ... I'm truly thankful,\" Sanders said of what motivates him. \"Truly a go-getter. I want to win at all costs. I want to win the right way. I want to set the right standards. And I want to prepare these young men for life not just for football, I want them to be professional.\" Sanders also shared his love for his fellow Big 12 coaches who he said have been supportive. \"The coaches of the Big 12 are incredible. I love them. They've been calling, checking on me, making sure I'm straight,\" Sanders said. \"But you talk about knowing football, teaching football,...",

        "content": "Cardinals starter Andre Pallante has not been as effective as many had hoped so far this season, but a recent uptick in performance is providing new optimism that he may yet be on the right track. Pallante takes the hill Wednesday as the Cardinals continue a series against the Nationals at 6:45 p.m. at Busch Stadium. St. Louis prevailed in a 'weird' rain-delayed opener late Tuesday. Pallante, with a 2.22 ERA in his last five starts, has shaved nearly a run off his ERA, which was nearing five in early June. Over the past month, the right-hander Pallante (5-4, 4.10 ERA overall) has the team's best ERA among starters and is the team's second most valuable starter by Fangraphs wins above replacement in that span. Opponents are hitting just .214 against him in his last five starts, and he has only allowed four barrelled balls in that time while keeping foes on the ground at a 65.1% rate. In four of his last five starts, Pallante has gotten groundballs about 70% of the time, a key factor to his success. Adjustments to his arsenal have been minor. He threw an equal percentage of breaking pitches as fastballs for the first time this season in his second-to-last start. In some starts earlier this season, two-thirds of Pallante's offerings were fastballs. Washington, on paper, would seem to be a good matchup for Pallante. Entering the series, the Nationals had hit the most groundballs in baseball while hitting them for the lowest average (.218). He'll need to be at his best as the...",

Setting aside all the abandoned attempts stuck forever in development hell, we’ve had two major big-screen pushes, one led by actor Brandon Routh and the other by Henry Cavill, and the second push was largely defined by the conflicts around Superman, and the darkness both internally and externally with which the character had to contend. But Superman is not, and has never been, about darkness, and it’s that belief that seems to be the driving force behind the latest attempt to give the character new cinematic life, this one overseen by “Guardians of the Galaxy” director James Gunn. Gunn, who’s setting out to build yet another cinematic universe with “Superman” as its centerpiece and first installment, clearly understands that his Man of Steel needs to be a character of light, of hope, of noble purpose. And in that understanding he rams headfirst into one of the character’s oldest dilemmas: How do you make a guy whose defining trait is his unflappable goodness into someone who’s dramatically satisfying?

The death toll on Wednesday stood at 111 with 161 still unaccounted for, according to Abbott. At least 27 children from Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' camp along the Guadalupe River, were killed, with several campers and one counselor still missing. Many of the victims are from the Houston area. Hundreds of searchers and cadaver dogs are working around the clock to look for the missing to bring some sense of closure to the families. They include Texas EquuSearch. \"Texas has sustained a devastating and heartbreaking loss as a result of the recent flooding events across the state. Countless lives have been lost during this horrific event, and an unbelievable amount of physical and emotional damage has been sustained throughout the state,\" Abbott said in a statement. \"It is therefore fitting that flags be lowered to half-staff to assist in mourning, remembrance, and recovery from this terrible disaster.\" Abbott requested that flags be returned to full staff at sunrise on Monday, July 14. Individuals, businesses, and other political subdivisions and entities are encouraged to fly their flags at half-staff for the same length of time as a mark of respect and remembrance. \"On behalf of Texas, the First Lady and I offer our thoughts and prayers on behalf families and survivors during their time of mourning and recovery,\" Abbott said.",

There are a little more than 35,000 charging stations across the country right now — well short of the 100,520 Canada needs to meet its policy goals for electric vehicles, researchers with the Montreal-based consultancy Dunsky Energy and Climate said in a report released last year. In a 2021 analysis commissioned by Natural Resources Canada, Dunsky estimated Canada needed 52,000 chargers by this year. It revised that target in a report released in February 2024 to take into account the need for charging infrastructure for commercial fleets and secondary roads. According to the most recent data from Natural Resources Canada, 88 per cent of Canada’s charging ports are in B.C., Ontario and Quebec — provinces which accounted for 92 per cent of new EV sales last year. Jeff Turner, director of mobility at Dunsky Energy and Climate, said the shortage of stations is hardest on EV drivers who live in multi-unit residential buildings and may rely on on-street parking. “The analysis that we did puts a pretty strong emphasis on the importance of an equitable transition to EVs,” Turner said. “And so we put a big focus on the need to support folks who can’t charge at home.” The federal government issued a call for proposals for public and...",

        "content": "Formed three years ago, Gigablue says it designed particles that when released in the ocean will trap carbon at the bottom of the sea. The company claims its work will save the planet. But outside scientists frustrated by the lack of information from the company say serious questions remain. Gigablue, founded by a group of entrepreneurs in Israel, originally was named “Gigaton” after the one billion metric tons of carbon dioxide most scientists say will be necessary to remove from the atmosphere each year to slow global warming. The company began trials in the South Pacific Ocean last year and says it will work with country authorities to create a “sequestration field” — a dedicated part of the ocean where “pulses” of particles will be released on a seasonal basis. The company announced this year that it reached a historic milestone: selling 200,000 carbon credits. It’s the largest sale to date for a climate startup operating in the ocean, according to the tracking site CDR.fyi, making up more than half of all ocean-based carbon credits sold last year. Carbon credits are tokens that symbolize the removal of one metric ton of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. On paper, companies that buy credits achieve a smaller carbon footprint without needing to reduce their own emissions — for instance, by paying another vendor to plant trees or capture carbon dioxide from the air. Only a few countries require industries to purchase carbon credits. Most companies that buy them do so...",

Seven people died in the small farming community of Esparto on July 1, roughly 80 miles north of the Bay Area. The dead were pulled from a warehouse operated by Devastating Pyrotechnics, a San Francisco-based business known for putting on fireworks shows for municipalities across the region. On Tuesday, officials with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's Fire Marshal's Office searched a home in the Inner Richmond neighborhood of San Francisco, according to news station KPIX. The home is registered as the company mailing address for Devastating Pyrotechnics and its chief executive, Kenneth Chee, in the state's fireworks wholesaler database. They were joined by sheriff's officials from Yolo and Sacramento counties, along with San Francisco police officers, the station reported. Local news outlet Hoodline reports that members of the Sacramento County Sheriff's Office's bomb squad were also present during the search of the home. \"Investigators are actively tracking down numerous leads and have served multiple search warrants as part of the investigation process,\" a spokesperson for the California Fire Marshal's Office said in a statement. \"While we are unable to provide additional details at this time, please know that we are committed to conducting a thorough and...",

(AP) — President Donald Trump's administration sued the California Department of Education on Wednesday for allowing transgender girls to compete on girls sports teams , alleging the policy violates federal law.

        "content": "Before widespread vaccination, devastating infectious diseases ran rampant in America — killing millions of children and leaving others with lifelong health problems. Over the past century, vaccines virtually wiped out long-feared scourges like polio and measles and drastically reduced the toll of many others. Now, some preventable, contagious diseases are making a comeback as vaccine hesitancy pushes immunization rates down. Well-established vaccines face suspicion even from public officials, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, running the federal health department. Anti-vaccine activists even portray the shots as a threat, focusing on the risk of rare side effects while ignoring the larger risks posed by the diseases themselves — and years of data that experts say proves the vaccines are safe. “This concern, this hesitancy, these questions about vaccines are a consequence of the great success of the vaccines — because they eliminated the diseases,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious-disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “If you’re not familiar with the disease, you don’t respect or even fear it. And therefore you don’t value the vaccine.” Yet, some Americans are very familiar with such preventable diseases. Janith Farnham’s daughter Jacque was born with congenital rubella syndrome, which resulted in hearing, eye and heart problems at birth. There was no vaccine against rubella back then, and Janith contracted it in early...",

Bedford fue confirmado con una votación casi partidista, de 53-43. Los republicanos y líderes de la industria elogiaron la nominación del presidente Donald Trump, citando la experiencia de Bedford como CEO de la aerolínea regional Republic Airways desde 1999. El senador Ted Cruz, presidente del Comité de Comercio del Senado, calificó a Bedford como un “líder estable con experiencia ejecutiva”.

        "content": "B ritpop band Oasis reunited for a five-month world tour this summer, marking the end of the yearslong feud between bandmates and brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher. The best way to celebrate this almost- too-good-to-be-true run of shows is to dive into the band’s rich catalog. Even if you know the hits and have committed their unimpeachable run of mid-’90s albums to memory — looking at you, 1994’s “Definitely Maybe,” 1995’s “(What’s the Story) Morning Glory?” and 1997’s “Be Here Now” — there’s so much more to dive into. Here’s a playlist of Oasis megahits and beloved B-sides. ￼‘Supersonic’ (1994) Where better to begin than at the beginning? Oasis’ first single, “Supersonic,” what would later appear on their landmark debut album “Definitely, Maybe,” immediately establishes an idiosyncratic band’s sound: Britpop that would soon grow massive. Their songs sounded like the Beatles performed with the edgy intensity of the Sex Pistols, as a popular description by the English press suggested at the time. ￼‘Live Forever’ (1994) From the jump, Noel emerged a prolific songwriter with unrivaled talent — so much so, that when he first played “Live Forever” for his bandmates, even they couldn’t believe he’d written such a massive tune. The song’s malleable structure — and its deviation from major chords to a minor on in its last chorus — gives it an incomplete feeling. It perfectly mirrors the song’s message. “Maybe you’re the same as me/We see things they’ll never see,” Liam sings. “You...",

According to The Associated Press, on Monday, Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block part of the recent tax and spending bill cutting the organization’s access to Medicaid reimbursements. “To speak plainly about what this means, it means that we remain in the Medicaid program. We continue to see Medicaid insured patients. We just can’t receive any payment for the services we are providing to them,” Clegg said of the bill She said that should the Medicaid payments not be received, 1.1 million Americans — including 8,000 across Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont — would see their health at risk. Clegg said one in four of PPNNE’s patients use Medicaid. The organization provides cancer screening, birth control, annual exams, menopause care, vasectomies, STI testing and treatment, as well as basic primary care. “Why would Congress want to take away this basic health care from millions of Americans? The answer is simple. Because...",

        "content": "BROADWAY — There’s no shying away from the challenges the program faces. Playing in a league with perennial state contenders like Spotswood, Turner Ashby, Harrisonburg, Rocktown and others, Broadway tends to get overlooked on the pitch. But when examining the progress the Gobblers have made in recent years and the potential the program has for the future, it’s hard not to associate it with one player's individual success. “The most important thing that changed was the culture of soccer in the Broadway area,” Broadway midfielder Leyden Mongold said. “[The interest in soccer] increased throughout my time playing there. ... It helped us improve so much. We had a lot of guys who played together for a while. We came together really quickly and just had a lot more success than previous years. I think they’ll be much better off in the years moving forward.” Mongold, a recent BHS graduate who will play next season at Bridgewater College, started for the Gobblers as a freshman on a team that was a sold middle-of-the road squad. But after losing 13 seniors to graduation, Mongold dealt with frustrations as a sophomore with his squad entering a bit of a rebuild and struggling to find any success on the field. “Leyden is truly a special player and has been a key leader on our team since his sophomore year,” Broadway head coach Phillip Ewell said. “He consistently leads by example and holds himself to the highest standard of accountability.” Slowly, improvement started to come for...",

        "content": "Leaders of the region’s Planned Parenthood group say they’re hopeful, but not optimistic, that the courts will intervene in its favor over the federal government’s attempts to “defund” it. “Today we are here to discuss the devastating impact of Congress’ decision to defund Planned Parenthood by prohibiting us from receiving payments for the services we provide to patients enrolled in the Medicaid program,” said Nicole Clegg, president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England (PPNNE). According to The Associated Press, on Monday, Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block part of the recent tax and spending bill cutting the organization’s access to Medicaid reimbursements. “To speak plainly about what this means, it means that we remain in the Medicaid program. We continue to see Medicaid insured patients. We just can’t receive any payment for the services we are providing to them,” Clegg said of the bill She said that should the Medicaid payments not be received, 1.1 million Americans — including 8,000 across Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont — would see their health at risk. Clegg said one in four of PPNNE’s patients use Medicaid. The organization provides cancer screening, birth control, annual exams, menopause care, vasectomies, STI testing and treatment, as well as basic primary care. “Why would Congress want to take away this basic health care from millions of Americans? The answer is simple. Because...",

        "content": "SAN ANTONIO — This article was originally published by our content partners at the Texas Tribune. Read the original article here . Camp Mystic, the private summer camp that now symbolizes the deadly Central Texas floods , sat on a tract of land known to be at high risk for a devastating flood. Nearly 1.3 million Texas homes are similarly situated in parts of the state susceptible to dangerous floodwaters, according to a state estimate. A quarter of the state’s land carries some degree of severe flood risk, leaving an estimated 5 million Texans in possible jeopardy. Yet, local governments — especially counties — have limited policy tools to regulate building in areas most prone to flooding. The state’s explosive growth, a yearning for inexpensive land, and a state far behind in planning for extreme weather compound the problem, experts said. While cities can largely decide what is built within their limits, counties have no jurisdiction to implement comprehensive zoning rules that could limit people from living close to the water’s edge. Camp Mystic and many of the other camps along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County, where the disaster’s wreckage has been concentrated, were far outside city limits and any regulatory authority of the Kerrville City Council. Some guardrails exist when it comes to building on flood plains. For property owners in flood-prone areas to tap federal flood insurance, localities have to enact minimum building standards set by the federal government....",

They're resilient, persistent, and seem to make a comeback no matter how many times you pluck them out. A common go-to solution is white vinegar, often hailed as a natural herbicide , but some specialists argue it might not be the best approach. Chelsey, a gardening guru from Good Grow, pointed out that while vinegar may appear effective, it fails to tackle the underlying issue . \"Vinegar simply burns away the visible part of the weed,\" she remarked. \"It may look dead and act dead, but the roots are still intact and will regrow.\" For those seeking a more potent and enduring solution, experts now suggest there's a superior household item for the task. Enter rock salt. While ordinary table salt can sometimes do the trick, Chelsey emphasized that rock salt packs a much stronger punch for dealing with pesky weeds in gravelly spots.\"It's the fastest way to kill weeds on your drive forever,\" she claimed. The team at Joe's Lawn Care concurs, labeling rock salt as an \"super-effective and totally natural weed killer\" that's particularly adept for use on gravel driveways. Their advice is simple: just scatter it around the base of the weeds and hold tight. \"Watch as the salt kills the weeds in just a matter of days,\" they suggested. \"It's almost unbelievable.\" Salt's secret weapon lies in its capacity to inhibit future growth. Once applied, it penetrates the earth and creates conditions...",

At least 160 people are still missing in Kerr Country, the hardest-hit area of the Texas Hill Country. Officials say no one has been found alive since July 4, when the deluge arrived in the pre-dawn hours, tearing through a 100-kilometer stretch of the Guadalupe River packed with vacationers. The waters inundated storied summer camps including Camp Mystic, where at least 27 children and counselors perished. Sheriff Larry Leitha said 2,100 people are involved in the response and the death toll in Kerry County alone has reached 95. Authorities said they’re concentrating their efforts in areas around the river that are choked with debris. Crews are using excavators and skid loaders to comb through heaps of trees, homes and wreckage in search of victims. More harrowing stories emerged from survivors, while demands grew for a fuller accounting of why more people didn’t get advance warning of the risks even as the National Weather Service sent out urgent alerts. Authorities have resisted discussing the specifics of the local response in the lead-up to the floods, saying the focus needed to be on recovery efforts. Rena Bailey, 77, may have been saved by her habit of watching online storm maps when foul weather arrives. She was awake in the...",

He most recently was senior deputy athletics director and chief revenue officer at Tennessee, a position he was promoted to in November 2023.

Alpert will replace J Batt, who left to take the same job at Michigan State. “Today’s announcement is a reflection of Georgia Tech’s commitment to elevating the competitive profile of our athletic programs on par with our academic profile,” Georgia Tech President Ángel Cabrera said in a news release. “Ryan Alpert is a dynamic, forward-thinking leader who understands what it takes to build a winning culture on a strong financial foundation. He brings deep operational expertise and a clear passion for student-athlete development. We are thrilled to welcome him to Georgia Tech.” Alpert had several stops on his way to Atlanta, including Missouri, Florida Atlantic and Memphis. He most recently was senior deputy athletics director and chief revenue officer at Tennessee, a position he was promoted to in November 2023. Alpert has a background in revenue generation, which will be a key component for athletic departments following the recently approved House settlement that permits Division I schools to pay athletes up to $20.5 million directly. “I’m incredibly grateful to President Cabrera and the search committee for the opportunity to serve as the next athletic director at Georgia Tech,” Alpert said in the release. “As college athletics continues in a period of rapid transformation, I’m excited about all the Institute has to offer and what we can...",

The National Saddle Clubs Association's 60th anniversary showcase of the National O-Mok-See Championship began Saturday and will last until Friday at the Lewis and Clark County Fairgrounds. This six-day event is put on by the NSCA and has a deep history in Indigenous culture. Its name is derived from the Blackfoot tribal term describing a type of pattern riding known as “oh-mak-see pass-kan,” meaning “riding big dance.” Contestants of all ages attend, with the age divisions being 7 and under, 8-11, 12-15, adults aged 18-39, and seniors aged 40 and above, who all ride in both individual and paired races. The NSCA, founded in 1965 by Keith Herrin, was approved by the Blackfeet Indian Affairs Bureau to develop the O-Mok-See name into a sport in 1944. The association’s first O-Mok-See Championship was in Helena in 1966, inviting saddle clubs from across the country to compete. For the NSCA's 60th anniversary, the championship was brought back to its hometown. Competitors race four at a time in 30-foot lanes that feature obstacles such as barrels, poles and flags, and are judged by their speed and accuracy on a 100-point scale. Heather Schreibvogel, 39, is Herrin’s daughter. She met her husband Roland Schreibvogel at the Lewis and Clark County Fairgrounds when they were 12. They celebrated 26 years of marriage this June and have a 5-month-old child....",

The hometown Pitt County Girls Softball League 12U team, which won its first-ever Little League Softball World Series last summer, repeated as state champions on Tuesday night to make their title defense official. With the victory in the state tournament, the PCGSL 12Us notched another berth to travel across town to play in the LLSWS at Elm Street Park in August. The clinching victory came in dramatic fashion and against a perennial state rival in Rowan County. Pitt triumphed, 6-5, in the bottom of the eighth inning to capture the state crown. It was an identical score to the 12Us comeback thriller earlier in the tournament to upend Mallard Creek and then advance to take out Rutherfordton on the way to the title game. The Little League Softball World Series runs from Aug. 3-10 in Stallings Stadium at Elm Street Park. The PCGSL 8U club also won a state title this week.

        "content": "WASHINGTON – Despite the fierce objections of the Flight 3407 families and leading Senate Democrats, the U.S. Senate’s Republican majority on Wednesday confirmed the former CEO of Republic Airways to head the Federal Aviation Administration. Senators confirmed Bryan Bedford to be FAA administrator in a 53-43 vote that largely fell along party lines. All Republicans present voted to confirm Bedford, but only one Democrat – Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire – backed him. The Flight 3407 families said they will continue to press Bedford to preserve the key safety reforms Congress passed after that 2009 crash in Clarence, which claimed 50 lives. Bryan Bedford testifies June 11 before the Senate Commerce Committee. The full Senate confirmed his nomination as head of the Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday. “During our recent meeting with Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, he assured us that aviation safety remains his top priority and there are no plans to change the 1,500-hour pilot qualification requirements,” said Scott Maurer, who lost his 30-year-old daughter, Lorin, in the crash. “If aviation safety truly is the top priority, we trust that Secretary Duffy will expect the same from Administrator Bedford and hold firm with no changes to the pilot qualification requirements. We will be watching their actions very closely.” The Bedford nomination stirred controversy because he’s a longtime critic of the requirement that commercial pilots have 1,500 hours of...",

The four siblings won the top prize worth $1.8 million in the June 30 drawing of Multi-Match in Ocean City, about a 145-mile drive southeast from Baltimore, the Maryland Lottery said in a July 9 news release. One other person won the jackpot for that drawing in Silver Spring, so the prize will be split between the two tickets, according to the lottery. The group of siblings told lottery officials they began pulling their money together to play Multi-Match after the birth of a child in their family several years ago. The sister in charge of collecting money and buying the ticket called each sibling to let them know they had perfectly matched six numbers in the game, lottery officials said. “Let’s rock and roll,” one sibling said in response to her call, according to the lottery. The winning ticket was bought at a Food Lion store, lottery officials said. The other winning ticket was bought at a Giant food store, lottery officials said. The odds of winning the jackpot per $2 ticket are 1 in 2,032,151.7 and the odds of winning per line are 1 in 6,096,454, according to the game’s web page. Many people can gamble or play games of chance without harm. However, for some, gambling is an addiction that can ruin lives and families.

        "content": "A Pennsylvania man was arrested after he was accused of stealing explicit photos from phones and posting them on the internet. Tyler J. Jones, 33, is facing dozens of charges including unlawful use of a computer, unlawful duplication, invasion of privacy and unlawful dissemination, according to a July 8 news release from the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office. The charges come after he was previously convicted of criminal use of a communication device and invasion of privacy. In that case he was accused of recording college students in a bathroom and posting the videos online, according to prosecutors. In this current case, Jones accessed the phones of five people and sent nude photos to himself without permission, officials said. He then posted the photos online, according to prosecutors. “This is another example of cruel and despicable behavior by a repeat offender who continues to weaponize modern technology to expose victims online,” Attorney General David Sunday said. “This criminal conduct traumatizes victims by impacting their careers, personal relationships, and almost every other aspect of their lives.” Jones was arraigned July 8 and his bail was set at $350,000.

In order to get Glasnow on the active roster to face the Milwaukee Brewers on Wednesday afternoon, the club optioned right-hander Alexis Diaz to Triple-A Oklahoma City. Glasnow, 31, last appeared in a major league game on April 27 and has been on the mend ever since with shoulder inflammation. He was 1-0 with a 4.50 ERA in five starts before his injury. Over 10 seasons with three clubs, including six with the Tampa Bay Rays, Glasnow is 40-33 with a 3.83 ERA over 154 appearances (115 starts). Kopech, 29, was acquired from the Chicago White Sox last season and was a key member of the bullpen in the Dodgers' run to a World Series title last season. He started the season on the IL with elbow and shoulder injuries before not allowing a run in eight appearances this season. Kopech received a pain-killing injection to his knee last week after going on the IL July 1 and will not be eligible to return until the end of August. Diaz, 28, was acquired by Los Angeles in a trade with the Cincinnati Reds on May 29 but has not made an appearance with his new club. He was 18-14 with 75 saves and a 3.21 ERA in four seasons with the Reds, including an All-Star Game appearance in 2023. In an additional move, the Dodgers traded outfielder Steward Berroa to the Brewers for cash considerations. Berroa,...",

At least 160 people are still missing in Kerr Country, the hardest-hit area of the Texas Hill Country. Officials say no one has been found alive since July 4, when the deluge arrived in the pre-dawn hours, tearing through a 100-kilometer stretch of the Guadalupe River packed with vacationers. The waters inundated storied summer camps including Camp Mystic, where at least 27 children and counselors perished. Sheriff Larry Leitha said 2,100 people are involved in the response and the death toll in Kerry County alone has reached 95. Authorities said they’re concentrating their efforts in areas around the river that are choked with debris. Crews are using excavators and skid loaders to comb through heaps of trees, homes and wreckage in search of victims. More harrowing stories emerged from survivors, while demands grew for a fuller accounting of why more people didn’t get advance warning of the risks even as the National Weather Service sent out urgent alerts. Authorities have resisted discussing the specifics of the local response in the lead-up to the floods, saying the focus needed to be on recovery efforts. Rena Bailey, 77, may have been saved by her habit of watching online storm maps when foul weather arrives. She was awake in the...",

        "content": "Jeffrey Bell watched as crews dug up and replaced neighbors’ lead water pipes, hoping his mother’s house would be next. Workers told him it wasn’t on their list but probably assigned to another contractor. With Flint, Michigan’s lead pipe replacement program winding down this year, Bell and his elderly mother worried the home they share was forgotten. Betty Bell repeatedly called the city while continuing to buy bottled drinking water, as she had for years. Finally someone called to say the water line was fine — records indicate it was checked in 2017. But the Bells didn’t know that, exemplifying residents’ confusion over a process marred by delays and poor communication. About a decade after Flint’s water crisis caused national outrage, replacement of lead water pipes isn’t finished. Though the city recently said it completed work required under a legal settlement, the agreement didn’t cover vacant homes and allowed owners to refuse, potentially leaving hundreds of pipes in the ground. The state agreed to oversee work on those properties. Flint’s missteps offer lessons for municipalities that face a recently imposed federal mandate to replace lead service lines. The Trump administration is expected to soon tell a federal appeals court if it will stand by that mandate. “I think other cities are racing not to be Flint,” said Margie Kelly, a spokesperson with the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, which reached a settlement with the city to force it to...",

        "content": "‘Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom,” Elon Musk declared on his social media platform, X. Another billionaire quickly replied on his social media platform, “I am saddened to watch Elon Musk go completely ‘off the rails,’ essentially becoming a TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks,” President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday night. “He even wants to start a third political party, despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States.” If I had to guess, Musk’s America Party will go nowhere. I wouldn’t be surprised if he doesn’t even file the required paperwork — the amount is so large it could probably be seen from space. And that’s just one of the daunting challenges facing third parties. Still, Trump is wrong. He is, after all, the head of the most successful third party in American history. The Republican Party was born in Ripon, Wisconsin, in 1854. Two years later, the Republican candidate for president, John Fremont, carried 11 (out of 31) states. Four years after that, Abraham Lincoln became the first Republican president, and the Whigs soon went the way of the dinosaurs. But other than that, lasting success — if measured by capturing the White House or being a major force beyond an election cycle or two — the record of third parties is not great. The primary reason is structural. Our first-past-the-post system for declaring a winner makes voting third party seem like a wasted vote. But that doesn’t mean third...",

(NASDAQ: AAPL) securities between June 10, 2024 and June 9, 2025. Apple is a multinational technology company that engages primarily in the business of smart-device and computer design and manufacturing, entertainment and artificial intelligence (\"AI\"). For more information, submit a , attorney Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call at (800) 350-6003. The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations That Apple, Inc. (AAPL) Misled Investors Regarding the Availability of Updates to its AI-Based Siri Feature According to the complaint, in June 2024, Apple announced advanced AI-based Siri features as the primary reason for customers to purchase the iPhone 16. Plaintiff contends, however, that during the class period, defendants failed to disclose that: (i) Apple misstated the time it would take to integrate the advanced AI-based Siri features into its devices; (ii) accordingly, it was highly unlikely that these features would be available for the iPhone 16; (iii) the lack of such advanced AI-based features would hurt iPhone 16 sales; and (iv) as a result, Apple's business and/or financial prospects were overstated. When the truth was revealed, Apple's stock price fell, harming investors. What Now: You may be eligible to participate in the class action against Apple, Inc.

        "content": "A longstanding tax exemption preventing nonprofit organizations from engaging in political campaign activity that favors individual candidates has been reinterpreted — signaling that religious organizations may now be excluded from the rule. The decades-old Johnson Amendment does not apply to speech by houses of worship to its congregation through “customary channels of communication,” the IRS said in a July 7 court filing in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The filing is an effort to resolve an August lawsuit against the IRS in which religious groups, including the National Religious Broadcasters, Intercessors for America and two Texas churches, take aim at the Johnson Amendment, stating that not being able to endorse a candidate is a violation of their First Amendment rights. McClatchy News reached out to the IRS on Tuesday but did not receive an immediate response. The National Religious Broadcasters told McClatchy News it is awaiting the judge’s decision on the filing before publicly commenting. What is the Johnson Amendment? In 1954, Congress approved an amendment by Sen. Lyndon Johnson that banned nonprofit organizations from engaging in political campaign activity on behalf of individual candidates. Although, according to the amendment, 501(c)(3) nonprofits are unable to endorse political candidates, they are not excluded from all political activity. A limited amount of lobbying and advocacy is allowed as well as nonpartisan voter...",

        "content": "After a series of setbacks, Kroger’s recent decision to close 60 locations nationwide is the latest sign of distress for the grocer. Kroger, the parent company of Ralphs and Food 4 Less, is reducing its footprint after the resignation of its chief executive and a failed merger with competing grocery giant Albertsons. The company faces a lawsuit related to the merger and also has been struggling with labor unrest. Employees had been threatening to strike until the company reached a tentative agreement with the United Food and Commercial Workers union this week. Based in Cincinnati, Kroger also owns Harris Teeter, King Soopers and Dillons. The company operates more than 2,700 stores under different brands across the country and offers fresh goods, some household items and pharmacy services. “Instead of popping champagne and toasting to their merger, Kroger is instead just enduring one hit after another,” said Jeff Wells, lead editor at the trade publication Grocery Dive. “They’re still a pretty stable business, but they’re facing a lot in terms of challenges.” Kroger announced late last month in its quarterly earnings report that it plans to close 60 stores over the next 18 months. The company did not disclose which locations would be shut down. “We’re simplifying our business and reviewing areas that will not be meaningful to our future growth,” interim Chief Executive Ronald Sargent said in an earnings call. “Today, not all of our stores are delivering the sustainable...",

        "content": "As the Trump administration continues aggressively dismantling urgent functions of government, critics should keep their criticism grounded in facts, lest they undermine their own credibility. With that in mind, this must be stated plainly: No evidence — none — now shows the administration’s moves to gut weather and climate science funding had any specific role in the tragic flash-flood deaths still being counted up in Texas. Efforts by some, including prominent Democrats in Congress, to draw a line between the White House’s defunding of weather preparedness and the more than 100 Texas deaths invites the kind of debunking and backlash that can silence more legitimate criticism of the administration going forward. The fable of the boy who cried wolf is instructive here. But here’s what people often forget regarding that fable: In the end, there really was a wolf. Part of the reason the administration’s anti-science funding cuts aren’t the culprit here is because they haven’t yet been fully implemented. Once they are, they likely will cost lives, as extreme weather events like this occur more frequently and the federal government is less equipped to respond. In that sense, the Texas deaths aren’t a smoking gun in the current tragedy but rather a cautionary tale about the future. That’s why Congress must confront the anti-science sabotage in which this president is so fully engaged. The freak rainstorm that caused the Guadalupe River in central Texas to rise more than 25 feet...",

        "content": "WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert recently shared her thoughts on some of the league’s most promising young talent, particularly focusing on JuJu Watkins and the Golden State Valkyries ’ surprising start as an expansion team. When asked about JuJu Watkins, who won't be WNBA-eligible until 2027 , Engelbert said in an exclusive interview with Mirror U.S. Sports , “JuJu — I can’t wait for her to come in.” However, she quickly tempered expectations for Watkins joining the Valkyries, adding, “They might be too good for that. They’re playing too well. They wanted a lottery ticket, but they’re playing too well!” The Valkyries’ strong performance in their inaugural season has put them in a position where landing a top draft pick, such as Watkins, seems unlikely. The new Bay Area expansion team recently rose to 10-9 on the season after taking down the Indiana Fever in a 80-61 beatdown, as Caitlin Clark returned to action after missing the last five games due to injury. Despite the shimmer around Watkins — widely touted as a top pick — Engelbert offered a sober reminder: injuries have delayed her debut. “But because of her injury, she’s two years away or so.” Watkins faced a significant setback after suffering a torn ACL during the NCAA tournament. The Golden State Valkyries have surprised many in their first season, playing at a level far beyond what is typically expected of an expansion team. Their success has generated buzz about their potential to become one of the premier...",

        "content": "JEFFERSON CITY — A commission overseeing clean water laws in Missouri rejected requests Wednesday to toughen environmental rules for meat producers who residents say are skirting rules governing concentrated animal feeding operations. The Missouri Clean Water Commission sided with farming groups instead, voting unanimously to reject the proposed changes, saying the rules should instead be addressed by the General Assembly. “We don’t want people to think we’re not mindful of their concerns,” said commissioner Stan Coday of Seymour. “We simply just don’t have much alternative but to leave the rules as they are.” In asking the six-member panel for changes, the groups argued that companies producing beef and chicken are opening multiple feedlots in rural counties that fall just under a threshold governing large-scale factory farms, allowing them to have less-stringent manure management plans. Stephen Jeffery, an environmental attorney, told the commission that the companies are using a loophole in state law that could endanger water supplies. “Currently, the scope of the existing CAFO regulations in Missouri provides an incentive to intentionally construct smaller Class IC facilities in order to avoid the regulatory requirements applicable to larger class facilities,” Jeffery wrote in his request for the rule change. At issue is Missouri’s approach to concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs, which are industrial facilities capable of raising thousands of hogs, cows or...",

With WNBA aspirations on her mind, Van Lith swapped Louisville red for LSU purple and gold and embarked on a new journey in Baton Rouge. Her lone season included another run to the Elite Eight and it was back to the transfer portal. Coach Mark Campbell’s pro-style offense caught her eye, and she decided her fifth and final year of eligibility would be spent at TCU. College sports was once rooted in tradition, school pride and loyalty, but those expectations are changing if not fading in a landscape where athletes have won the ability to transfer season to season, year to year. Some are painted as disloyal or selfish but Van Lith and others don’t see it that way. “Whenever you transfer, you always expect pushback,” Van Lith told The Associated Press. “I can’t tell you how many podcasts I’ve seen on people discussing my choices to go to this school and that school, and the theories that are thrown out there are all wrong. But it’s just, you learn to live in harmony with that, and at the end of the day, I just decided I’m no longer going to let false assumptions disrupt my peace.” One of the...",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to allow Florida to enforce an immigration law making it a crime for people who are living in the U.S. illegally to enter the state. The high court's action will keep the law on hold while a legal challenge continues. The court did not explain its decision and no justice noted a dissent. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the legislation into law in February in support of President Donald Trump’s push to crack down on illegal immigration. Immigrants rights groups filed lawsuits on behalf of two unnamed, Florida-based immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, arguing that immigration is a federal issue beyond the power of the states. U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams barred the enforcement of the new law in April. The attorney general’s office then unsuccessfully petitioned the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to override that decision. The law is similar to a Texas law that also has been blocked by a federal appeals court.",

Ferentz, 69, is under contract as Hawkeyes head coach at an average of $7 million per year through the 2029 season. But Ferentz said he expects to sign another contract with Iowa. \"I would think so,\" Ferentz told the Des Moines Register's 'Hawk Central'. \"I think you almost have to in the world we're living in.\" Ferentz has coached at Iowa since 1999 and has a 204-124 overall record, putting him one win shy of the Big Ten conference record for wins held by Ohio State legend Woody Hayes. Hired by Hayden Fry as offensive line coach in 1981, Ferentz already holds Iowa's football coaching record for wins. He's approaching the mark for longevity, too. Fry retired at age 69. \"If you can't do your job, I have no interest in hanging on,\" Ferentz said in the interview. \"I don't think it's going to come to that. I think it'll be how I'm feeling toward things. The other thing is, I'll have to figure out what it is I'm going to do when I get done.\" Iowa was 8-5 last season and is on a run of 12 consecutive winning seasons. --Field Level Media",

Another off-duty officer tied a garden hose around his waist so he could reach two people clinging to a tree above swirling floodwaters, Kerrville officer Jonathan Lamb said, describing another harrowing rescue. \"This tragedy, as horrific as it is, could have been so much worse,” Lamb told a news conference, crediting first responders and volunteers with saving lives during the flash floods on the July Fourth holiday. More than 160 people still are believed to be missing and at least 115 have died in the floods that laid waste to the Hill Country region of Texas . The large number of missing suggests that the full extent of the catastrophe is still unclear five days after the disaster. The floods are now the deadliest from inland flooding in the U.S. since 1976, when Colorado’s Big Thompson Canyon flooded, killing 144 people, said Bob Henson, a meteorologist with Yale Climate Connections. Crews used backhoes and their bare hands Wednesday to dig through piles of debris that stretched for miles along the Guadalupe River in the search of the missing. “We will not stop until every missing person is accounted for,” Gov. Greg Abbott told a news conference Tuesday. \"Know this also: There very likely could be more added to that list.”...",

        "content": "Love Island USA season 7 cast member Huda Mustafa has opened up about her cosmetic procedures, admitting she had a “bad boob job” just months before appearing on the hit Peacock dating series. The 24-year-old fitness influencer and mom has undergone a noticeable transformation since old videos surfaced showing a much different appearance. In April 2025, just two months before entering the Love Island villa, Huda traveled to Turkey for a rhinoplasty. In a TikTok video posted by Dr. Muhammet Dilber, Huda can be seen reacting emotionally to her results shortly after surgery. “Oh my God, wow. I think I’m going to cry. That’s my nose? I’m going to cry. Oh my God, it’s so pretty. It fits my face so good,” she said in the clip. Her nose job sparked online discussion, with many fans pointing out how different she looked before entering the villa. Now, Huda has admitted she also underwent a breast augmentation, but said the results were not what she had hoped for. While speaking with fellow islanders, Huda revealed the procedure didn’t go as planned and described it as a “bad boob job.” Her admission came after Dr. Daniel Barrett of Barrett Beverly Hills previously suggested she had a chest augmentation, noting changes to her figure. Huda’s pre-show evolution has been captured in past content. In exclusive footage from 2019 obtained by The U.S. Sun , Huda could be seen singing heartbreak songs with a different nose and without freckles. At the time, she wore long, dark brown hair....",

Speaking in English at Imperial College London , Macron said the neighbouring nations \"are lagging behind both the US and China... And the big question for all of us is how to be part of the competition and indeed to de-risk our model and not to be dependent on US and or Chinese solutions\". The president added: \"The partnership between the UK and France is for me critical, because we... face the same challenges.\" He said \"having closer links is the best way to fix... critical issues on research, science and AI\". Macron added that \"teaming up... is the best way to have a critical mass when we speak about our talents, our labs, our key players, or our financing capacities\". Macron calls for UK-France reset amid war and migration pressures Regulating AI However differences have emerged between the UK and France on regulating AI. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has invited companies to test their AI innovations in the UK outside of regulatory restrictions - a clear distinction with the European Union following Brexit . By contrast, dozens of Europe's biggest companies last week urged the EU to pause its landmark AI rules, warning that going too fast could harm the bloc's ability to lead in the global artificial intelligence race.

The trial of alleged serial sexual predator Michael Mark Haaima resumed for its sixth week on Wednesday, Jul. 2, 2025, with the testimony of two police officers who were called to a residence in Kingston’s west end in 2010 for a domestic dispute. Last week, a witness testified that she was the victim of an assault at Haaima’s hands and called 911 that night, but when officers arrived, she did not tell them the truth about what had occurred because she was scared. On Wednesday, Constable Ryan Lawlor and Detective Constable Rad Miksa testified that they were newly minted patrol officers in October 2010 when they attended a “domestic” incident where a female called 911. Although neither officer had a clear independent memory of the incident, both had taken notes at the time. The officers’ notes indicated that they were met outside by Haaima, who told the officers that he and his girlfriend had gotten into an argument because she was “texting other guys.” He said that he was leaving the home. Lawlor’s notes indicated that in an interview conducted at the front door of the residence, the female said Haaima had been calling her names and “getting in her face.” She ordered him out of the house, and he wouldn’t leave.

Bass Coast returns to Merritt for its 17th year from July 11 to 14 with a mix of local and international electronic artists. The popular boutique festival is built around four core stages, each with its own identity. From riverside dance floors to hidden gathering spots, each is shaped by intentional design and curated sound. This year will also see the addition of the new stage, Somewhere, described as a fresh space for connection, music exploration, and music programming running from noon to 4 a.m. A post shared by Bass Coast Festival (@basscoastfest) “Experience headliners in a more intimate setting, with main stage PK sound,” said Bass Coast in a release. “Think Cantina’s welcoming energy, scaled up, and surrounded by live murals, performance artists, underground club-inspired production and interactive art.” Somewhere includes a new cocktail and mocktail bar, will host the J-Rod Invitational Arm Wrestling Championship, and features performers like Conducta, The Funk Hunters, G Jones and Main Phase. Longtime fans of Bass Coast will also want to make time for Slay Bay, named initially during the festival’s early days in Squamish. Slay Bay is an immersive stage environment designed by co-founder Liz Thomson that wraps 360 degrees around the dance floor, making partygoers feel like they’re...",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Wednesday confirmed Bryan Bedford to lead the Federal Aviation Administration, putting him in charge of the federal agency at a precarious time for the airline industry after recent accidents , including the January collision near Washington, D.C. that killed 67 people. Bedford was confirmed on a near party-line vote, 53-43. Republicans and industry leaders lauded President Donald Trump's choice of Bedford, citing his experience as CEO of regional airline Republic Airways since 1999. Sen. Ted Cruz , the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, called Bedford a “steady leader with executive experience.” But Democrats and flight safety advocates opposed his nomination, citing Bedford's lack of commitment to the 1,500-hour training requirement for pilots that was put in place by Congress after a 2009 plane crash near Buffalo. Bedford declined during his confirmation hearing to commit to upholding a rule requiring 1,500 hours of training for pilots, saying only that he would not “have anything that will reduce safety.” Sen. Maria Cantwell , the top Democrat on the Commerce panel, accused Bedford of wanting “to roll back safety reforms and unravel the regulatory framework that made the United States the gold standard” in aviation safety. Congress implemented the 1,500-hour rule for pilot training and other safety precautions after the 2009 Colgan Air crash in Buffalo, New York.

If you have not already subscribed for free, please consider doing so here . It’s 2033. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is Supreme Empress of the Decolonized States Of America. As part of her first executive decree, Dear Leader AOC bans all nicotine products and sentences the Phillip Morris executive board to a decade of hard labor in a gulag in Humboldt County, California, where they will harvest marijuana by day, and face DEI struggle sessions by night. You hear of the news on a Monday evening, in the dead of winter. You shudder at the thought of Phillip Morris execs being frog-marched into a Pride-themed gulag. After eating a bowl of plant-based “meat” for dinner in your rent-controlled pod, you slide your last after-meal Zyn into the lower deck and take an evening stroll through the city to clear your head. (Subscribe to MR. RIGHT, a free weekly newsletter about modern masculinity) What do you see? You pass by a “safe” injection site where you can jab your veins and flood your bloodstream with heroin and ketamine – all on the taxpayer dime. Not a block further, you pass a mobile vasectomy van – one of hundreds parked throughout the city – and a line of men – pale, thin, dejected – stretching down the sidewalk.

Мы делаем замечания, но это бесполезно», — рассказали спасатели, которые безрезультатно говорят о запрете купания. На этой неделе в Зеленограде высокая температура — больше 30 градусов. Отдыхающие признают, что о запрете знают, но вода — единственное спасение. «Мы видели таблички, но искупаться сейчас просто необходимо. Тем более, в городе все зоны отдыха закрыты. Поэтому без разницы, куда идти. А на Школьном ещё и территория красивая», — отметила отдыхающая Любовь. По словам спасателей, людей действительно трудно остановить в такую жару. Они убедительно просят хотя бы не окунаться с головой и избегать попадание воды в организм. Обычно Роспотребнадзор проводит исследования качества воды раз в неделю — не исключено, что в четверг или пятницу запрет на купание снимут (или продлят).",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is reshaping a student loan cancellation program into what some fear will become a tool for political retribution, taking aim at organizations that serve immigrants and transgender youth. Public Service Loan Forgiveness allows government employees, such as teachers and firefighters, plus many who work for nonprofits, to have their student loans canceled after they made payments for 10 years. The Education Department is preparing an overhaul that would strip the benefit from organizations involved in “illegal activities,” with the final determination left up to the U.S. education secretary. A draft proposal released by the department includes definitions of illegal activity that center on immigration, terrorism and transgender issues. Several advocates invited to weigh in on the draft proposal raised concerns it would give the department subjective authority to decide if an organization is engaged in anything illegal — a power that could be used to remove entire hospital systems or state governments from the program. “That’s definitely an indicator for me that this is politically motivated and perhaps will be used as a tool for political punishment,” said Betsy Mayotte, president of the Institute of Student Loan Advisors and one of the advocates asked to review the policy as part of a rulemaking process. More than 1 million Americans had loans canceled through the program, including nurses, college staffers and park rangers. Congress...",

Council approved making the pilot program permanent on May 22, 2025, following a report from township staff that it was generating local interest. Councillor Paul Burroughs questioned whether the bylaw would be the same for rural and residential properties. “I propose that residences on two acres of land should be excluded from the bylaw. For those with more land, there is ample space so that neighbours wouldn’t be disturbed by the hens or their impact,” Burroughs said. Regarding language clarity, Burroughs explained, “The purpose of this bylaw is to have limitations, but when you’re in the middle of the countryside, why are we obliged to have these permits? In the rural area, we are quite distant from our neighbours. There are key differences between rural and urban areas, and this needs to be specified.” Councillor Peter Barton said that there was no intention to limit residents outside the villages’ boundaries. “I would prefer more specific language relating to the villages and removing any restrictions outside of that area,” Barton said.

His caddie, Eric Larson, is stuck at home without being able to obtain a new Electronic Travel Authority visa for travel to the U.K., a regulation that now applies to Americans. Grounds for refusal include an applicant who has been convicted of a criminal offense in the U.K. or overseas for which they served 12 months or more in prison. Thirty years ago, Larson pleaded guilty to sending cocaine to friends in the Midwest. Though he wasn’t a user or big-time dealer, he spent 10 years and three months in prison and was released from a halfway house in June 2006. Mark Calcavecchia hired him back and got him on his feet. Since then, Larson worked for three players at the Ryder Cup — Anthony Kim in 2008, Jeff Overton in 2010 and most recently English, with whom he has worked the last eight years. “I guess the United Kingdom doesn’t look highly on his past,” English said Tuesday at The Renaissance Club before his pro-am round. “And apparently it’s a work in progress.” English, who is No. 19 in the world and 10th in the U.S. standings for the Ryder Cup, said he didn’t become aware of Larson’s plight until right after he tied for fourth at the Travelers Championship three weeks ago. Joe Etter is filling in — for now — as his caddie. Etter, who started out working for English more than a decade ago,...",

While commending the work of Big 12 Commissioner Brett Yormark in his opening remarks, Sanders said that Yormark called him daily to check to make sure he was getting better. There have also been a lot of calls from his fellow league coaches. “I love them, they've been calling and checking on me, making sure I'm straight,” Sanders said. This will be Sanders first season at Colorado without having one of his sons on the team. Quarterback Shedeur Sanders was a fifth-round pick by the Cleveland...",

That much was evident Tuesday when he walked into the media center at the Scottish Open and saw his picture. It was on a wall beneath a sign that said, “TOILETS.” “That was heartwarming,” Schauffele said with a grin that never seems too far away. “Summed up how I feel about what’s going on right now. I actually chuckled when I saw that one.” He is the only American to win the Scottish Open over the last 10 years. He defends his title next week in the British Open, a victory that made him a double major winner in 2024, which allowed him to take his place among the elite in golf. That can feel like much longer than a year ago. Schauffele had reason to have big expectations this year. What he didn’t see coming was a twinge in his ribs to start the season in Hawaii that turned out to be much worse — an intercostal strain and a cartilage tear. He missed two months with the first significant injury of his career. He has not been the same since then, with only one top-10 finish, a tie for eighth in the Masters. His greatest achievement was extending his cut streak on the PGA Tour to 67 consecutive tournaments, the longest such streak in 20 years. “I probably downplayed it in my own mind — ‘Yeah, you’ll be fine, you’ve been playing great golf, you just came off the best year of your career’ — and I’ve backed it up currently with the worst year of my...",

        "content": "MADRID (AP) — A Spanish court on Wednesday sentenced Brazil coach Carlo Ancelotti to a one-year prison term for tax fraud when he was Real Madrid manager in 2014. The Madrid court also fined Ancelotti 386,000 euros ($452,187). Spanish prosecutors accused Ancelotti of defrauding the state of 1 million euros ($1 million) in 2014 and 2015. State prosecutors sought a prison sentence of up to four years and nine months on two counts of tax fraud . In March 2024, they accused Ancelotti of having used shell companies to hide his true earnings. Prosecutors claimed Ancelotti, for example, used one company that lacked “any real (economic) activity” in the Virgin Islands as part of an alleged scheme. In Spain a judge can suspend a sentence of less than two years for first-time offenders. Prosecutors had asked for a sentence of almost five years. A staffer in Ancelotti's team told The Associated Press that his lawyers welcomed the court's decision, which also ruled that Ancelotti was not formally a Spanish resident in 2015. The staffer spoke under condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Brazil’s soccer confederation has not publicly commented on the court's ruling. The Italian coach is the latest in a string of major soccer profiles to face a crackdown by Spanish authorities over unpaid taxes, although none have actually been sent to prison so far. That list includes star players Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, as well as Jose...",

        "content": "MINNEAPOLIS — Two men were caught in Minneapolis and have been charged with possessing nearly 900 pounds of methamphetamine in what local and federal law enforcement are touting as a significant bust with ties to Mexican drug cartels. In connection with the massive meth seizure Monday in south Minneapolis, Guillermo Mercado Chaparro, 44, of Chicago stands charged in Hennepin County District Court with two counts of first-degree drug trafficking. Joel Casas-Santiago, 46, of Minneapolis is charged with one count of first-degree drug trafficking. Chaparro and Casas-Santiago remain jailed in lieu of $2 million each ahead of their court appearances Wednesday afternoon. Court records do not list an attorney for either man. Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said in a statement that “the amount of illicit drugs recovered in this case is staggering. These drugs were on our streets in huge quantities and nearly made it into the hands of our neighbors who struggle with drug use. “The damage 900 pounds of methamphetamine could have caused is devastating, all while funding drug sale organizations that prey on our community.” Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino went on X and praised the “hit targeting drug trafficking rings. ... We’re finding them and crushing their operations.” The St. Paul Police Department, also on X, said the operation involving its officers, the Ramsey County Violent Crime Enforcement Team and federal law enforcement pulled off what “might ... be the largest drug...",

Brown Jr. Clarksburg Detective Sgt. Kevin Collins lodged the felony charge against Johnny Joe Brown Jr. Brown went to jail on a $25,000 cash or surety bond after pleading not guilty in his initial appearance before Harrison Chief Magistrate Frank DeMarco. Wrongdoing was alleged in early June. Further details of the case aren’t available under a recent West Virginia law. Brown is presumed innocent. If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison; would have to register as a sex offender for life; and would face a supervised release term of up to 50 years whenever his initial sentence ended. Back in May of 2021, Brown, then living in Weston, was sentenced to a year in jail for two misdemeanors: Indecent exposure, and harassing phone calls. State Police accused Brown of sending a female parole officer an inappropriate video of himself, along with making harassing phone calls, according to Weston Democrat reporting. Also: — Tresa Eubank has pleaded guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael John Aloi to straw purchase of a firearm Oct. 31, 2023, in Monongalia County. The government alleged Eubanks bought a .40-caliber pistol for a felon. Chief U.S. District Judge Thomas S. Kleeh will have final say on acceptance of the plea and plea agreement, and also will preside over sentencing. Assistant U.S. Attorney...",

        "content": "IOWA CITY — The excitement of securing a commitment from the No. 10 transfer portal quarterback faded quickly. After back-to-back seasons plagued by injuries at the quarterback position, the news of Mark Gronowski’s shoulder injury, which forced the four-star South Dakota State transfer to undergo surgery and prevented him from fully participating in spring practices, landed like a lead balloon. Iowa's Mark Gronowski throws the ball during warmups at the Hawkeyes' open spring practice in Kinnick Stadium on Saturday, April 26. ETHAN PETRIK, Quad-City Times Though the Naperville, Illinois native played through the injury while leading the Jackrabbits to a second consecutive FCS National Championship, the thought of another transfer quarterback joining the Hawkeyes at less than 100% soured the excitement of the addition. On Wednesday, Mark Gronowski said the injury is behind him just under six months since undergoing the elective surgery. And, the excitement and optimism have returned. “I’m feeling 100%,” Gronowski said. “I’m out here working with the guys every single day in lift, throwing during our throwing sessions, practicing during our captain practices. I feel great. Iowa's Mark Gronowski participates in a quarterback drill during the Hawkeyes' open spring practice in Kinnick Stadium on Saturday, April 26. ETHAN PETRIK, Quad-City Times “...

At the June 24 St. Marys council meeting, council approved a new capital project to be completed later this year that will see the installation of 13 new LED streetlights and poles along that section of trail west of the Thames River. In 2023, a number of large donations were similarly made to support new lighting and asphalt along 700 metres of trail. According to the staff report on this project, one of those donors committed to donating funds for this year’s trail-improvement project. “When we were approached earlier this year by a resident who made a large-sum donation to the trail network, we reviewed some of the priorities for the trail and some of the issues we’ve heard from trail users in the past, and the highest-priority item within the available funds of the donation was a lighting project from Ingersoll Street to the Sarnia Bridge,” said infrastructure services manager Jeff Wolfe. According to the staff report, the Grand Trunk Trail west of the Thames River has steep embankments along the sides of the trail and is very dark at night with limited light cast from adjacent properties. Town staff regularly receive concerns from trail users about the lack of lighting in this area.

        "content": "The Town of St. Marys will not provide local landfill space to help the City of Toronto dispose of residual waste as it deals with impending landfill-capacity issues. At the June 24 St. Marys council meeting, councillors voted to have staff submit a response to the City of Toronto’s request for expression of interest indicating the Town of St. Marys is not interested in accepting, selling or partnering with the City of Toronto for their residual waste management services. “They are basically starting the process that we started a decade ago related to our own landfill expansion where they’re running out of capacity at their Green Lane facility and are looking throughout the province, basically, to see if anyone is interested in supporting them in any way related to their residual-waste strategy moving forward,” St. Marys environmental services manager Dave Blake told councillors. “Because we went through this process for the last decade or so ... we have looked at additional sites within the community for our own landfill needs, and didn’t really find viable alternatives to our existing landfill, which is why we decided to go down the path for expansion at our existing facility.

        "content": "SEATTLE (AP) — Though natural disasters cycle across seasons and regions in the U.S., it’s often a shocking discovery for property owners how expansive and expensive flood and water damage can be when a major storm devastates their homes, businesses and communities. That’s because oftentimes insurance doesn’t cover what the policyholder thinks it does — or thinks it should. The disappointing surprise is that while the standard home insurance policy does cover fire and wind damage, even good property insurance typically doesn’t cover things like flooding and earthquakes, which usually require a special and separate policy for each. Here are the things to know about flood insurance. Most people who have flood insurance are required to have it. Although many property owners have the option of purchasing flood insurance, it is mandated for government-backed mortgages that sit in areas that the Federal Emergency Management Agency deems highest risk. Many banks require it in high-risk zones, too. But most private insurance companies don’t carry flood insurance, leaving the National Flood Insurance Program run by FEMA as the primary provider. Congress created the federal flood insurance program more than 50 years ago when many private insurers stopped offering policies in high-risk areas.

AFP journalists in Kyiv heard explosions ringing out and drones buzzing over the capital during the barrage after air raid sirens sounded. The air force said Russia fired 728 drones and 13 missiles, specifying that its air defence systems intercepted 711 drones and destroyed seven missiles. The strike, which officials said killed one civilian in the Khmelnytsky region, beat a previous Russian record of 550 drones and missiles fired at Ukraine on one day last week. \"This is a telling attack -- and it comes precisely at a time when so many efforts have been made to achieve peace, to establish a ceasefire, and yet only Russia continues to rebuff them all,\" President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on social media. Zelensky, who met Pope Leo XIV and US special envoy Keith Kellogg on a visit to Rome, called for Ukraine's allies to step up sanctions on Russia, particularly on its key energy sector. Following his meeting with Kellogg, the Ukrainian leader urged US lawmakers to pass a bill targeting Russia with tougher sanctions.

The strike comes after US Donald Trump said he would ramp up arms deliveries to Ukraine and accused his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin of talking \"bullshit\" on Ukraine. AFP journalists in Kyiv heard explosions ringing out and drones buzzing over the capital during the barrage after air raid sirens sounded. The latest strike, which regional officials said killed one civilian in the Khmelnytsky region, beat a previous Russian record of 550 drones and missiles set last week. The air force said Russia attacked with 728 drones and 13 missiles, adding that its air defence systems intercepted 711 drones and destroyed seven missiles. \"This is a telling attack -- and it comes precisely at a time when so many efforts have been made to achieve peace, to establish a ceasefire, and yet only Russia continues to rebuff them all,\" President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on social media.

По его словам, данная информация его поразила, учитывая тот факт, что российские солдаты не оставят тела бойцов противника на поле боя и соберут их. «Вот до такого скотства не доходил еще никто, даже бандеровцы не доходили до этого. Этот факт свидетельствует о полнейшем уже моральном разложении, деградации командования, да и личного состава», — отметил генерал.

        "content": "As the Trump administration continues aggressively dismantling urgent functions of government, critics should keep their criticism grounded in facts, lest they undermine their own credibility. With that in mind, this must be stated plainly: No evidence — none — now shows the administration’s moves to gut weather and climate science funding had any specific role in the tragic flash-flood deaths still being counted up in Texas. Efforts by some, including prominent Democrats in Congress, to draw a line between the White House’s defunding of weather preparedness and the more than 100 Texas deaths invites the kind of debunking and backlash that can silence more legitimate criticism of the administration going forward. The fable of the boy who cried wolf is instructive here. But here’s what people often forget regarding that fable: In the end, there really was a wolf. Part of the reason the administration’s anti-science funding cuts aren’t the culprit here is because they haven’t yet been fully implemented. Once they are, they likely will cost lives, as extreme weather events like this occur more frequently and the federal government is less equipped to respond. In that sense, the Texas deaths aren’t a smoking gun in the current tragedy but rather a cautionary tale about the future. That’s why Congress must confront the anti-science sabotage in which this president is so fully engaged. The freak rainstorm that caused the Guadalupe River in central Texas to rise more than 25 feet...",

Another billionaire quickly replied on his social media platform, “I am saddened to watch Elon Musk go completely ‘off the rails,’ essentially becoming a TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks,” President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday night. “He even wants to start a third political party, despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States.” If I had to guess, Musk’s America Party will go nowhere. I wouldn’t be surprised if he doesn’t even file the required paperwork — the amount is so large it could probably be seen from space. And that’s just one of the daunting challenges facing third parties. Still, Trump is wrong. He is, after all, the head of the most successful third party in American history. The Republican Party was born in Ripon, Wisconsin, in 1854. Two years later, the Republican candidate for president, John Fremont, carried 11 (out of 31) states. Four years after that, Abraham Lincoln became the first Republican president, and the Whigs soon went the way of the dinosaurs. But other than that, lasting success — if measured by capturing the White House or being a major force beyond an election cycle or two — the record of third parties is not great. The primary reason is structural. Our first-past-the-post system for declaring a winner makes voting third party seem like a wasted vote. But that doesn’t mean third...",

        "content": "The FBI has opened a criminal investigation into its former director James Comey and ex-CIA chief John Brennan, two prominent critics of President Donald Trump, US media reported. Fox News Digital said the probe involved \"potential wrongdoing\" related to the investigation into claims of Russian interference in the 2016 election won by Trump and alleged false statements made to Congress. CIA director John Ratcliffe, a Trump appointee, had referred \"evidence of wrongdoing by Brennan\" to FBI director Kash Patel, another Trump appointee, for potential prosecution, Fox News Digital said, citing Justice Department sources. Comey and Brennan were named to their respective positions as head of the FBI and CIA by Democratic president Barack Obama, and they have a contentious history with Trump dating back to his first term in the White House. Trump fired Comey in 2017 as the FBI chief was leading a probe into whether any members of the Trump campaign had colluded with Moscow to sway the 2016 presidential vote between Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. That investigation was taken over by special counsel Robert Mueller, who found there had been interference by Russia in the 2016 election in favor of Trump. But Mueller said the probe \"did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\" Trump revoked Brennan's security clearance in 2018, accusing the former CIA director of making...",

        "content": "When a student turns in a writing assignment done at home and it’s clear parts of the finished piece don’t represent the kind of work the student usually does in the classroom, should the teacher grade it anyway? This is the dilemma educators face in a world of artificial intelligence. Students look to get credit for work done by a digital tool. It’s modern-day cheating. Educators used to tell parents not to do their child’s homework because it didn’t benefit them in the long run. Those conversations could get contentious. I often would suggest to teachers to ask their students if they or their parents did the work. Children often would tell the truth. Unfortunately, it’s more complex now. Parents often aren’t doing the work. But for some students, a computer is. The question remains: Should homework become a thing of the past? With young people having access to AI, how do we know if students are doing the homework themselves? Homework has compelling arguments for and against it. The website Helpful Professor notes that homework is time-consuming and stressful, contributes to anxiety and is inequitable because some students don’t have caregivers who can help. On the other hand, it teaches discipline, helps students manage their time better and gives students self-paced learning time. In my experience as a school leader, few topics inspire such positive and negative comments from teachers as homework. What can help guide decisions is understanding the community and the...",

Before him were roman candles, comets, a variety of shells. I remember only two times when his face resembled that of a child on Christmas morning—when he was driving his motor boat at the lake and when he looked over his collection of fireworks. For my father, fireworks were magic, but for my dog they are terrifying. And my dog is not alone in his fright. Half of all dogs are frightened by fireworks, hiding, howling or crying in their trauma. All over our nation this week pets were traumatized for hours before they could recover. Eight out of ten horses experience this anxiety too and a quarter of them suffer some injury when they run into fences. This panic occurs yearly among pets as well as among wild animals. Some birds literally die from the effect of the loud noise on their hearts. On the coastal areas birds have been seen to fly so far out to sea that they lack the energy to return to shore. Other birds and squirrels flee their nests and if the mothers cannot locate their nests in the dark their new babies may die of starvation. Why do we do this to our natural treasures? To our pets? Is there no other way to celebrate our nation’s founding? There must be a way to grant the animals an independence from these tragedies on our Independence Day. Many cities have recently found a way. They have replaced the...",
