        "content": "IMD has announced that this year the southwest monsoon is likely to set in over Kerala on May 31. New Delhi: India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecasted above-average monsoon rains in the country this year in its Updated Long Range Forecast Outlook on Monday, confirming its April forecast of a good monsoon. “Quantitatively, the southwest monsoon seasonal rainfall over the country as a whole is likely to be 106 per cent of the Long Period Average (LPA) with a model error of 4 per cent. Thus above normal rainfall is most likely over the country as a whole during the monsoon season from June to September 2024,” IMD said. IMD has based the forecast of the good monsoon on the fact that the strong El Nino conditions which tend to disrupt the monsoon have weakened rapidly into weak El Nino conditions and are currently transitioning into ENSO-neutral conditions. The latest climate model forecasts indicate ENSO-neutral conditions are likely to establish during the beginning of the monsoon season and La Nina conditions, which result in good rains, are likely to develop during the later part of the monsoon season. IMD has announced that this year the southwest monsoon is likely to set in over Kerala on May 31. A good monsoon augurs well for the country’s agricultural sector which was hit by erratic weather last year. The monsoon plays a key role in the Indian economy as close to 50 per cent of the country's farmland does not have any other source of irrigation. The monsoon rains are also crucial for recharging the country’s reservoirs and aquifers from which the water can be used later in the year to irrigate crops. India has emerged as a key exporter of foodgrains but had to resort to curbing overseas shipments of sugar, rice, wheat and onions in order to increase domestic supplies and keep prices in check due to the erratic monsoon last year which hit farm production. The IMD defines average or normal rainfall as between 96 per cent and 104 per cent of a 50-year average of 87 cm (35 inches) for the June-Sept season.",

        "content": "May 27, (THEWILL) – The Bayelsa State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal, in Abuja, has declared Douye Diri of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as duly elected Bayelsa State governor. A three-member panel of Justices, led by Adekunle Adeleye, upheld the victory of Diri in the November 11, 2023, gubernatorial election and dismissed as lacking in merit, the petition that was brought before it by the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate, Timipre Sylva. In its unanimous decision, the tribunal held that the petitioners failed to adduce any credible evidence to substantiate any of the allegations they raised against the outcome of the election. Consequently, the tribunal struck out as incompetent, all the additional proof of evidence, as well as statements on oath of some of the witnesses that testified for the petitioners. According to the tribunal, the law expressly provided that an election petition must be filed not later than 21 days after the result of an election was declared. It held that such a petition must be accompanied by written statements of all the intended witnesses at the time it was filed. The tribunal held that the decision of Sylva and his party to file their additional proof of evidence and statement on oath of witnesses, long after they had filed the petition, was “tantamount to a surreptitious attempt to amend the case of the petitioners.” The tribunal further dismissed the allegation that the deputy governor, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, tendered a forged University Degree Certificate and NYSC Exemption Certificate, to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in aid of his qualification to contest the election. It held that the allegation was a pre-election matter that ought to be litigated before the Federal High Court, adding that the matter had become statute-barred since the petitioners failed to challenge the genuineness of the certificates, 14 days after it was submitted to INEC. The tribunal held that a court of competent jurisdiction previously determined the issue of Ewhrudjakpo’s educational qualification. Holding that the petitioners were unable to discharge the burden of proof that was placed on them by the law, the three justices unanimously dismissed the petition and declared Duoye Diri of the PDP, the duly elected governor of Bayelsa.",

        "description": "Two-time NBA champion and Hall of Famer Bill Walton has died of cancer at the age of 71, the NBA announced Monday.",
        "content": "Basketball legend Bill Walton, who led the to two national titles before winning two championships during his NBA career, has died at the age of 71 after a prolonged battle with cancer. The NBA issued a statement saying Walton died Monday while surrounded by his family. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season and a member of both the NBA's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year under iconic coach John Wooden. \"What I will remember most about him was his zest for life, Silver said in his statement. \"He was a regular presence at league events -- always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered. \"As a cherished member of the NBA family for 50 years, Bill will be deeply missed by all those who came to know and love him.\" Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life on the court, off the court and during his broadcasting career. His NBA career -- disrupted by chronic foot injuries -- lasted only 468 games with , the San Diego and eventually and . He averaged a double-double in those games -- 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. However, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against , in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. The Bruins kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. \"It's very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA's program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. \"As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It's hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.\" Walton originally joined ESPN and ABC in 2002 as a lead analyst for NBA games before shifting to college basketball in 2012. He also worked for CBS and NBC and was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all-time by the American Sportscasters Association in 2009. \"As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position,\" Silver said. \"Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans.\" The first overall pick of the 1974 NBA draft by the Trail Blazers, the 6-foot-11 Walton played 10 seasons in the NBA, winning championships with the Blazers (1977) and the Celtics (1986). He averaged a double-double over his career, totaling 6,215 points (13.3 per game), 4,923 rebounds (10.5 per game), 1,034 blocks (2.2 per game) and 1,590 assists. A two-time All-Star, he led the NBA in rebounding and blocks in 1977 and was the league's Sixth Man of the Year in 1986.",

        "content": "Linda MacMullen has been battling with a rare autoimmune disease called myasthenia gravis (MG) for over two decades. This chronic disorder causes weakness in the skeletal muscles, which are responsible for a wide range of body movements and breathing. Myasthenia gravis can affect various facial muscles, altering a person’s ability to smile, chew, swallow, and control their eye movements. One of the most common symptoms experienced by people diagnosed with the disorder is becoming exhausted and feeling weaker following brief periods of physical activity or after performing everyday tasks. “Symptoms can be very mild where it just affects your eyes or it could be very severe where you end up in the hospital on a ventilator,” explained MacMullen. However, perhaps the most debilitating symptom of MG, according to MacMullen, is one that is not visible. “When you get diagnosed, the biggest thing is that you feel so alone,” said MacMullen. “When I was diagnosed, I’d never heard of my myasthenia and I was a nurse. (My) biggest (goal now) is breaking this isolation (and helping others.)” Though this disease has no cure to date, the prospect of a new drug called Vyvgart, approved by Health Canada in late 2023, gives hope to MacMullen. “One of my friends in Ontario is getting that treatment right now so we’re all waiting to see how well it works with her,” she said. “Anything that can give people a better quality of life and allow them to do the things that give them pleasure (I’m all for it.)” In the meantime, as June approaches, marking Myasthenia Gravis Awareness Month, MacMullen invites residents of the Comox Valley and beyond to a walk she organizes annually. “(I’m doing this walk) mainly to raise awareness (and) funds,” said MacMullen. “The more awareness we create, the more people know about it. Right now, my whole focus is on improving (people’s) quality of life.” MacMullen explained that any donations can go a long way. “(With more funding we) would offer more support to patients and caregivers dealing with myasthenia gravis. It would also allow me to organize more events like online support groups where we have guest speakers and get more information about new upcoming treatments.” This year’s event will be held at Courtenay’s Woodcote Park and is scheduled for June 23, starting at 10 a.m. Hot dogs and water will be offered at the end of the walk. Donations are appreciated and can be made on-site. To learn more about myasthenia gravis, visit",

        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that a deadly strike that hit a displacement camp in Gaza's Rafah was a \"tragic accident\" which his government was investigating. \"In Rafah, we evacuated a million uninvolved residents and, despite our best efforts, a tragic accident happened yesterday,\" Netanyahu told parliament. He added that \"we are investigating the case and will draw the conclusions\" after Gaza's health ministry reported 45 dead as the strike late Sunday sparked a fire that tore through a tent city for displaced Gazans. The ministry in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip also said that 249 people were wounded. Israel faced a wave of international condemnation on Monday over the Rafah strike, including from across the region as well from the European Union, France and the United Nations. The Israeli military said it had launched a probe into the strike which it said was carried out based on \"precise intelligence information\" about two Hamas militants who it said were killed. It also said \"the strike did not occur in the humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi, to which the IDF (army) has encouraged civilians to evacuate\" since the ground operation began in Rafah. Netanyahu struck a defiant tone in his Knesset address while being heckled by relatives of hostages held in Gaza, and vowed to keep up the battle to destroy Hamas. \"There is no substitute for absolute victory\" in Gaza, he told the chamber. Netanyahu denounced pressure, both internal and external, that he said his government has faced since the war in Gaza began. \"They pressured us then,\" said Netanyahu, before listing calls to refrain from military operations which Israel carried out anyway. \"Don't enter Gaza. We entered! Do not enter Shifa! We entered! Do not enter Khan Yunis! We entered! Do not enter Rafah! We entered!\" he said. \"I don't give up and I won't give up! I stand up to pressures from home and abroad.",

        "content": "The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) reported a smooth start to the casting of special votes on Monday, despite some glitches resulting in voting stations opening late in parts of the country. The first official day of voting inside the country was marred by isolated protests - in the Eastern Cape and parts of Gauteng - and there were reports of voting stations failing to open, but the IEC indicated that only 0.1% of those casting their votes experienced problems doing so. The IEC's deputy chief electoral commissioner, Masego Sheburi, said that, from 14:00 on Monday, around 201 794 people visited voting stations to cast special votes across the country. A total of 1 668 076 people had applied for special votes. Of these, 624 593 citizens will be visited by 62 000 officials over the next two days. \"Reports of difficulties were insignificant... about 0.1% reported challenges compared to those [stations] that opened and were run smoothly,\" he said. READ | Special votes day 1: Slow queues, a sense of obligation, and a lamp post Rickroll He said a record number of voters had applied for special votes this time around, with more than 1.6 million voters applying for special votes this year compared to the 774 000 who applied in 2019. \"The Electoral Commission is happy with the turnout and urges South Africans to continue to go out in their numbers to vote on 29 May 2024. \"Owing to the good preparations, the commission was able to open the majority of voting stations in the Eastern Cape, in the face of protests which had nothing to do with elections.\" He told journalists that 107 of the 435 voting stations meant to open remained closed due to \"external factors\". The IEC is pushing to ensure that all voting stations open on Tuesday. Some voting stations failed to open due to a lack of stationary - ballot papers and envelopes. Special votes are cast using a two-envelope system. The voter places their ballots into an envelope in the ballot box, which is then inserted into a second envelope, with the name and identity number of the individual, before being placed in the ballot box. This ensures that all votes cast are accounted for when they are counted. Special votes are counted along with the bulk votes, which are cast on 29 May. Special votes continue on Tuesday, ahead of the election day for the rest of the country on Wednesday, with polls opening at 07:00.",

        "description": "The sensitive updates to this Victorian home have refreshed its look without compromising on heritage charm",
        "content": "The renovation of this family home in Brookline, MA, was all about finding the right balance. The 1905-built Victorian home already had plenty of period charm – all part of the original – but its new owners wanted to add in a few key user-friendly details that you'd be more likely to find in a newly built home. How to update a heritage property without sacrificing its character and meaningful details: that was the challenge for this renovation. To ensure they came up with the right solution the owners enlisted the help of . 'This project spoke to our design hearts with the encouragement to create a masterful blend and bring something fresh to the table,' says principal Vani Sayeed, who describes how she gave the historic home a new lease of life, all the while being mindful of its unique character. 'The goal was to first update the interior architecture by moving a few walls, restoring some of the original architectural details and adding important design elements to elevate and make all spaces not only functional but beautiful and inviting,' says designer Vani Sayeed. 'The client wanted an updated space that had the charm and architectural details of a bygone era but with all the bells and whistles and comforts of a modern home.' The renovation kept the basic layout of a classic Victorian home as the homeowner was drawn to more private areas to entertain, such as a formal dining room, separate kitchen and this cozy parlor . The Roman shades fabric is Sacho Clouds from TM Interiors, with a coffee table from Restoration Hardware, and wall sconces from Urban Electric. The artworks are from the owners' existing Collection, with some from Vani Sayeed. 'This project was a collaboration between client and designer based on a mutual love of classic New England architecture, the ethereal beauty of the California coastline and the grand Rocky Mountains of Colorado,' explains Vani Sayeed. 'With this in mind as the inspiration we aspired to create spaces that reflected the calming rejuvenating quality found in nature.' This comfortable space includes a custom rug from Vani Sayeed's Global Chic Collection, with the designer selecting the perfect for the living room. Vani Sayeed Studios is an award-winning multi-discipline design firm. Vani Sayeed is the firm’s principal; well known for her globally inspired and beautifully layered spaces. She was awarded Interior Designer of the Year 2023 by IFDA, New England. Her inspiration comes from a worldly well-travelled and creative perspective. She is informed by a diverse sensibility of design, art and architecture. The ethos of the studio is to honor classical traditions, while embracing novelty and innovation. While the furnishings and furniture are contemporary, the bones of the house clearly reference the property's Victorian origins. Details such as the striking bay windows and smart architectural moldings truly ground the home and ensure it keeps its character, even though it has been updated to make for a more comfortable family life. Tucked into an original alcove, this stylish enhances and makes good use of the Victorian architecture. 'The kitchen was completely gutted down to studs and redesigned to create a larger footprint, along with new windows, cabinets and state-of-the-art appliances,' says Vani. are light and bright with white cabinetry and a dark blue custom-built island providing a good contrast with the white units. The cabinets are from Signature, the countertops are white quartzite in a leather finish and the island is in the dramatic quartzite explosion blue leathered 2.5” mitered edge were at the heart of Vani's redesigned kitchen, with the trio of contemporary pendant lights above the counter becoming a new focal point. Coming up with the right for the redesigned kitchen took some thinking. Vani knew there should be a second element of contrast with the white cabinetry, besides the dark marble-topped island, and the custom stainless steel hood in a more traditional style proved to be the perfect choice, inspired by a Henry Moore sculpture, says Vani. 'These old houses are full of surprises,' says Vani, 'but the one thing that actually turned into a major plus is the breakfast nook in the kitchen. It was carved out of a found space during our demolition of the old kitchen. Instead of boarding it back up, we realigned some of the structure and utilized this valuable real estate by incorporating it into a spot for breakfast with hidden LED lighting.' Anyone looking for will surely be inspired by this treatment. 'We covered the niche in a cool blue crocodile pattern wall covering from Elitis, adding stainless steel open shelves and gorgeous oak details,' adds Vani. Although the owner was keen to embrace separate and formal , this space sits at the heart of the home, with enlarged doorways through to the kitchen and foyer. The central position adds to the impression that you are in an intimate, cozy space – the perfect setting for good mealtime conversations. 'We love this dining room with walls covered in Elitis Luminescent Isis. The gold hammered effect of the wall covering makes your skin glow!' says designer Vani. Furniture includes a custom-designed dining table with a steel base and mahogany top, flanked by chairs from Dowel Furniture. The jewel pieces are the host and hostess chairs by Jamie Stern in two different fabrics. The backs are a bold Schumacher Tabriz, the inside fabric is Perennials' Classy design. The area rug is the Summer Day Walk, from Vani Sayeed's Global Chic Collection, the chandelier is from Urban Electric. Making a big impact as you walk in the front door is the imposing but welcoming . 'The two-level foyer has beautiful architectural woodwork that has been restored to its original beauty. The lighting is Urban Electric, the fireplace has been updated with a gas insert and beautiful Fossil Black Quartzite surround,' says Vani. took shape around a dramatic wool runner from Merida Rugs, which provides a great foundation to the bold art on the wall. On the hallway's lower level, this corner creates an appealing display moment with a dark wood table and bench grounding a fine landscape painting and a collection of treasured ceramics. Having the luxury of space and quirky alcoves to create interesting displays like this is something that older character homes do well. The window treatments in this calm are made in Clodagh, a simple fabric from Perennials, the bed is Room & Board flanked on either side by wall sconces from Estiluz, with a beautiful nude painting from the owner's collection. The primary bathroom is spacious with a shower and separate soaking tub. include shower walls covered in a green marble mosaic and the floor is a 12“x24“ faux marble porcelain tile from Porcelanosa.

The quirky Buggie Atomic 29 wallcovering by Abnormals Anonymous lends a fun element to the walls, with custom-made copper plumbing adding the luxurious finishing touches. It's the thoughtful details in this historic home's redesign that so successfully bridge the gap between period charm and modern-day comforts.

        "description": "As we bid farewell to Ambassador Raveesh Kumar, the esteemed Indian representative in Finland, we reflect on his impactful tenure that began amidst the challenging backdrop of the global pandemic. Ambassador Kumar has been known for his active engagement during his time here, working to strengthen the bond between India and Finland. In this interview, we have the privilege of gaining insights from Ambassador Kumar as he shares his experiences, achievements, and perspectives garnered during his engaging four-year term in Finland.",
        "content": "You arrived in Finland just as the pandemic began. How was it to commence your mission during such challenging times? I arrived in Finland with my family in July 2020, in the middle of Covid pandemic. There were restrictions on movement, on meeting people. It felt like we were constantly navigating uncharted territory. Everything from remote work setups to health protocols kept changing, and it was a challenge to keep up. It was a test of adaptability and resilience like never before. I was fortunate to present my credentials to then President Niinistö and continued with our outreach initiatives. Even though it was a tough period, I think we all came out of it stronger in some way. It’s all behind us now, thankfully. You've been one of the most active ambassadors in Finland. Could you summarize your tenure here? Were you able to achieve your envisioned goals? As diplomats, we all are expected to do some groundwork before proceeding on our assignment. But then, implementation depends on the ground realities. And here, I was quite fortunate to be around when our relations are looking up and have acquired a certain momentum. The backdrop of the evolving geopolitical order played its part too. We have Finland as a member of NATO, part of Nordic-BALTIC framework and an influential voice in the EU. India is an important voice for the global south, the 5th largest and fastest growing economy and a country shaping the global narrative. We have a far larger global footprint and are members of several multilateral organisations like I2U2, BRICS, SCO, and recently launched India-Middle East-Europe initiative, Global Biofuel Alliance, ISA, etc. So, despite our own preoccupations, it goes to the credit of both countries that our relations have acquired substance and character. I had twin broad objectives in mind when I arrived here – present the new India with a rising geopolitical profile as a land of opportunities; and leverage the dynamism of the Indian community in Finland for strengthening our bilateral ties. The launch of DESI (Digitalisation, Education, Sustainability and Innovation) initiative, first-in person meeting between Prime Ministers, frequent Ministerial exchanges, opening of a new Finnish Consulate in Mumbai, record high trade figure of € 3 bn, growing investment by both sides, record participation at SLUSH and discussion on facilitating mobility are the highlights. We are working on creating a framework to cooperate in Quantum and in Sustainability. They all demonstrate the keen desire of both countries to engage in a concrete manner with each other in areas which are of interest and relevance to both countries as we celebrate 75 years of our diplomatic relations. On the Indian community, I am proud to represent a widely respected vibrant community. We managed to bring them together on a number of platforms like Friends of India and Finland (a platform representing 16 Indian community associations), India Business and Professionals Forum, connecting top Indian professionals and entrepreneurs and Finland India Network of Researchers and Academics. India Day, a festival celebrating friendship between both countries, is a proud product of the vibrant Indian community. You introduced the Open Doors initiative, allowing any Indian citizen to visit you twice a month without an appointment. How successful was this initiative, and what insights did you gain into the Indian community in Finland? The idea of Open House was to be accessible and transparent to the people. And to connect to the people who otherwise are outside the footprint of the Embassy. I managed to meet so many interesting people and learn from their own cumulative experiences in Finland. With the rapid growth of the Indian community in Finland, particularly in skilled IT sectors, how has this impacted the embassy's operations? Are there concerns about brain drain from India? The Indian community has emerged as a strong bridge connecting India and Finland. They are a well-placed and well-respected community in Finland. A community which contributes economically and socially to Finland. They are among the highest tax payers and well-integrated into the fabric of the Finnish society. We are leveraging their presence for a stronger bilateral connection between both countries. Were there any significant cultural adjustments or \"culture shocks\" you experienced during your four years in Finland? Well...’culture shock’ is too strong a word. Moving to Finland definitely involved some adjustments, especially related to weather, as with any international move. I found some aspects of Finnish culture different from what I was used to. I mean, where else can you enjoy sitting in a sauna at 90 degrees Celsius, and then jump into an ice-cold lake for fun? But once you absorb it with an open mind, it is not only a memorable experience, but also gives insights into the rich Finnish culture and tradition. As you prepare to lead the Indian mission in Prague and your successor takes over in Helsinki, what advice have you given regarding Finland, and what insights has your colleague offered about the Czech Republic? Well, I am in regular touch with my colleague and friend, Hemant, who is succeeding me as Ambassador and I take his place in Prague. We are discussing the upcoming agenda for both of us, as well as exchanging notes on the lighter side of things. On a lighter note, I am going to advise him to get a dog, to his your social circle in the neighbourhood! If you could provide feedback to the Finnish Minister of Foreign Affairs and your counterparts here, what would it entail? I had an excellent working relationship with the Foreign Ministry and other Ministries in Finland. I was quite delighted that there was the same level of enthusiasm to expand our partnership. I would say that we need to work together to elevate the relationship into a different orbit. Could you discuss the impact of your tenure on fostering collaborations, promoting cultural exchange, facilitating trade and investment, and engaging with the Indian diaspora in Finland? It may not be appropriate for me to judge my own tenure. It is for others to assess. I can, however, say that I was fortunate to be in Finland when there is plenty of goodwill on both sides. I strived to play my part in encouraging collaborations, promoting cultural exchange and facilitating trade and investment. Additionally, engaging with the Indian diaspora in Finland has been a rewarding experience, as we have worked together to build a supportive and vibrant community that strengthens the ties between our countries. While there is always more work to be done, I am satisfied with the strides we have made so far. Could you share any memorable experiences or anecdotes from your time as ambassador in Finland? There are many that come to my mind. My recent meeting with President Stubb and former Prime Minister Sanna Marin. My trips to 14 towns outside Helsinki, Yoga at midnight at Oonasvara in Rovaniemi, being among the many thousands at Savonlinna Opera Festival and the sheer thrill and energy of Jyvaskyla car rally. I would also highlight the whole experience of organising India Day 2023 with a dedicated and selfless team of volunteers. The warmth and enthusiasm of the community, combined with the participation of our Finnish friends, truly highlighted the beautiful blend of our cultures. India Day 2024 on 18 August at Meripuisto celebrating 75 years of diplomatic relations between India and Finland promises to be one big celebration. Alexis Kouros Helsinki Times",

        "content": "Karan Kandhari ‘s “ Sister Midnight ” is a surreal Mumbai fable with an aggressive comedic rhythm. It’s composed by hitting the same few notes ad nauseam, but hitting them exceptionally well and for much longer than one might expect before it eventually runs out of steam. All the while, Kandhari takes a novel visual approach to the topic of arranged marriage, situating his woebegone couple — his protagonist in particular, a woman who feels trapped — in a realm of strange psychosis. It’s better than it has any right to be, but not nearly as good as it should be. Uma (Radhika Apte) is brash, acerbic and vulgar. Unable to cook or manage household expenses, she fulfills very few of the rigid expectations of a new Indian bride. When she arrives at her cramped new one-room apartment with her soft-spoken husband Gopal (Ashok Pathak) — an ostensible stranger — on their wedding night, the awkwardness between them is palpable. She wants to (or perhaps, believes it’s her duty to) sleep with him, but he can barely take his shirt off in front of her. It doesn’t take long for Kandhari to establish his snappy comedic vibe, with all the calculated framing, editing and choreography of a Wes Anderson action scene (the wake in “The Grand Budapest Hotel” comes to mind, with its litany of well-timed punches). However, first-time feature director Kandhari also marches to the beat of his own drum, constrained by neither tone nor genre expectation. His music choices range from Bengali folk to American punk and blues. While of Indian origin, Kandhari is London-based and draws from a variety of cultural influences, but his depiction of working class Mumbai never feels inauthentic, especially in the movie’s quieter, low-lit moments, whose shadowy visual contrast creates striking portraits of Uma that verge on expressionistic. While Gopal is at work, Uma tries to settle into a domestic routine, which involves everything from learning to chop vegetables to figuring out how to spend her free time in her crowded neighborhood, whose bustling noise prevents her from sleeping in. The happily married woman next door, Sheetal (played by Chhaya Kadam, who also stars in Cannes Grand Prix winner “All We Imagine As Light”) takes Uma under her wing and delivers even her most impassioned and welcoming lines with wry, impenetrable wit. It’s a role Kadam nails completely, finding variance even within comedic monotony, and she makes for an amusing contrast with Apte’s more fiery and unpredictable performance. Between Uma’s gossiping neighbors and the pressures of social expectation, her psyche begins to rip apart at the seams, until eventually she finds a particularly macabre outlet for her frustrations. When her anxieties begin to manifest in the world around her, Kandhari makes tremendously inventive use of stop-motion elements. They cause a kind of fissure in his world-building, revealing seamlessly blended images that don’t quite make logical sense or — like Uma herself — feel like they belong. However, the more sudden genre swerves “Sister Midnight” takes, the more Kandhari cedes control to an imagined version of his film that does not (and perhaps cannot) exist. His story holds Indian patriarchal norms to account and via its sensitive, anxious depiction of Gopal, makes him as much a victim of circumstance as Uma, if not more so. The exact subgenres from which “Sister Midnight” ultimately takes its cues are better left unspoiled, but several of its genre hallmarks harken back to films about the all-consuming nature of romance. However, the misfortunes that eventually befall Gopal, courtesy of Uma’s crumbling state of mind, lead to incongruous outcomes that feel too irreverently nasty. Kandhari has a clear and perverse vision, but he’s also incredibly successful (perhaps to a fault) at eliciting sympathy for his characters. The bleak, punk-feminist parable he tries to build, using phantasmagorical imagery, strays too far toward the realm of disturbing — both emotionally and viscerally — to fully connect and keep viewers on its wavelength. This dissonance also collides with (and perhaps contributes to) the movie’s clockwork rhythm becoming too mechanical to manage. Beyond a point, its visual comedy no longer remains unpredictable, and everything that initially works about its unique sensibilities becomes a burden, preventing “Sister Midnight” from undergoing the metamorphosis necessary to chase its initial surrealist high. The story soon gets away from Kandhari, leading to a film that enraptures and delights in its first hour but gets so locked in to a singular approach by its second that it’s practically consumed by its own style, rendering it unable to keep pace with the bold ideas at play.",

        "description": "Generations of American families have grown up not knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones who died while serving their country in World War II and other conflicts. But a federal lab aims to answer those questions.",
        "content": "OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. — Generations of American families have grown up not knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones who died while serving their country in World War II and other conflicts. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency forensic anthropologist Carrie Brown looks at objects in a lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. But a federal lab tucked away above the bowling alley at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha and a sister lab in Hawaii are steadily answering those lingering questions, aiming to offer 200 families per year the chance to honor their relatives with a proper burial. “They may not even have been alive when that service member was alive, but that story gets carried down through the generations,\" said Carrie Brown, a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab manager at Offutt. \"They may have seen on the mantle a picture of that person when they were little and not really understood or known who they were.” Memorial Day and the upcoming 80th anniversary of D-Day on June 6 are reminders of the urgency of Brown's work. The forensic anthropologists, medical examiners and historians who work together to identify lost soldiers are in a race against time as remains buried on battlefields around the globe deteriorate. But advances in DNA technology, combined with innovative techniques including comparing bones to chest X-rays taken by the military, mean the labs can identify more of the missing soldiers every year. Some 72,000 World War II soldiers remain unaccounted for, along with roughly 10,000 more from all the conflicts since. The experts believe about half of those are recoverable. The agency identified 59 servicemembers in 2013, when the Offutt lab first opened. That number has steadily risen — 159 service members last year, up from 134 in 2022 — and the labs have a goal of 200 identifications annually. Donna Kennedy holds a photo of her cousin Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, who was buried with full military honors, May 20 in Lawson, Mo. The labs' work allowed Donna Kennedy to bury her cousin, Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, with full military honors this month in the same Lawson, Missouri, cemetery where his father and grandfather are buried. Patten died 74 years ago during the Korean War, but spent decades buried as an unknown in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii. “I just, I ached. I mean, it hurt. You know, I just felt so bad. Even though I didn’t know him, I loved him,” Kennedy said. Patten's funeral was a simple affair with just a few family members. But often when veterans who fought decades earlier are identified, people waving flags and holding signs line the streets of their hometowns to herald the return of their remains. “This work is important first and foremost because these are individuals that gave their lives to protect our freedom, and they paid the ultimate sacrifice. So we’re here holding that promise that we’ll return them home to their families,” Brown said. Photos of service members are seen on a wall in a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. \"It’s important for their families to show them that we’ll never stop, no matter what,” she said. Often there are compelling details, Brown said. One of her first cases involved the intact remains of a World War I Marine found in a forest in France with his wallet still in his pocket. The wallet, initialed G.H., contained a New York Times article describing plans for the offensive in which he ultimately died. He also had an infantryman badge with his name and the year he received it on the back. Before leaving France with the remains, the team visited a local cemetery where other soldiers were buried and learned there were only two missing soldiers with the initials G.H. Brown had a fair idea who that soldier was before his remains even arrived in the lab. That veteran was buried in Arlington National Cemetery and Brown often visits his grave when she is in Washington D.C. Most cases aren’t that easy. A worker looks at objects in a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. The experts who work at the lab must piece together identities by looking at historical records about where the remains were found and which soldiers were in the area. They then consult the list of possible names and use the bones, objects found with them, military medical records and DNA to confirm their identities. They focus on battles and plane crashes where they have the greatest chance of success because of available information. But their work can be complicated if soldiers were buried in a temporary cemetery and moved when a unit was forced to retreat. And unidentified soldiers were often buried together. When remains are brought to the lab, they sometimes include an extra bone. Experts then spend months or even years matching the bones and waiting for DNA and other test results to confirm their identities. One test even can identify if the soldier grew up primarily eating rice or a corn-based diet. The lab also compares specific traits of collar bones to the chest X-rays the military routinely took of soldiers before they were deployed. It helps that the military keeps extensive records of all soldiers. Those clues help the experts put together the puzzle of someone's identity. “It’s not always easy. It’s certainly not instantaneous,” Brown said. “Some of the cases, we really have to fight to get to that spot, because some of them have been gone for 80 years.” A man looks at a damaged car after a tornado hit the day before, Sunday, May 26, 2024, in Valley View, Texas.

        "content": "OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. — Generations of American families have grown up not knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones who died while serving their country in World War II and other conflicts. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency forensic anthropologist Carrie Brown looks at objects in a lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. But a federal lab tucked away above the bowling alley at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha and a sister lab in Hawaii are steadily answering those lingering questions, aiming to offer 200 families per year the chance to honor their relatives with a proper burial. “They may not even have been alive when that service member was alive, but that story gets carried down through the generations,\" said Carrie Brown, a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab manager at Offutt. \"They may have seen on the mantle a picture of that person when they were little and not really understood or known who they were.” Memorial Day and the upcoming 80th anniversary of D-Day on June 6 are reminders of the urgency of Brown's work. The forensic anthropologists, medical examiners and historians who work together to identify lost soldiers are in a race against time as remains buried on battlefields around the globe deteriorate. But advances in DNA technology, combined with innovative techniques including comparing bones to chest X-rays taken by the military, mean the labs can identify more of the missing soldiers every year. Some 72,000 World War II soldiers remain unaccounted for, along with roughly 10,000 more from all the conflicts since. The experts believe about half of those are recoverable. The agency identified 59 servicemembers in 2013, when the Offutt lab first opened. That number has steadily risen — 159 service members last year, up from 134 in 2022 — and the labs have a goal of 200 identifications annually. Donna Kennedy holds a photo of her cousin Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, who was buried with full military honors, May 20 in Lawson, Mo. The labs' work allowed Donna Kennedy to bury her cousin, Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, with full military honors this month in the same Lawson, Missouri, cemetery where his father and grandfather are buried. Patten died 74 years ago during the Korean War, but spent decades buried as an unknown in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii. “I just, I ached. I mean, it hurt. You know, I just felt so bad. Even though I didn’t know him, I loved him,” Kennedy said. Patten's funeral was a simple affair with just a few family members. But often when veterans who fought decades earlier are identified, people waving flags and holding signs line the streets of their hometowns to herald the return of their remains. “This work is important first and foremost because these are individuals that gave their lives to protect our freedom, and they paid the ultimate sacrifice. So we’re here holding that promise that we’ll return them home to their families,” Brown said. Photos of service members are seen on a wall in a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. \"It’s important for their families to show them that we’ll never stop, no matter what,” she said. Often there are compelling details, Brown said. One of her first cases involved the intact remains of a World War I Marine found in a forest in France with his wallet still in his pocket. The wallet, initialed G.H., contained a New York Times article describing plans for the offensive in which he ultimately died. He also had an infantryman badge with his name and the year he received it on the back. Before leaving France with the remains, the team visited a local cemetery where other soldiers were buried and learned there were only two missing soldiers with the initials G.H. Brown had a fair idea who that soldier was before his remains even arrived in the lab. That veteran was buried in Arlington National Cemetery and Brown often visits his grave when she is in Washington D.C. Most cases aren’t that easy. A worker looks at objects in a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. The experts who work at the lab must piece together identities by looking at historical records about where the remains were found and which soldiers were in the area. They then consult the list of possible names and use the bones, objects found with them, military medical records and DNA to confirm their identities. They focus on battles and plane crashes where they have the greatest chance of success because of available information. But their work can be complicated if soldiers were buried in a temporary cemetery and moved when a unit was forced to retreat. And unidentified soldiers were often buried together. When remains are brought to the lab, they sometimes include an extra bone. Experts then spend months or even years matching the bones and waiting for DNA and other test results to confirm their identities. One test even can identify if the soldier grew up primarily eating rice or a corn-based diet. The lab also compares specific traits of collar bones to the chest X-rays the military routinely took of soldiers before they were deployed. It helps that the military keeps extensive records of all soldiers. Those clues help the experts put together the puzzle of someone's identity. “It’s not always easy. It’s certainly not instantaneous,” Brown said. “Some of the cases, we really have to fight to get to that spot, because some of them have been gone for 80 years.” A man looks at a damaged car after a tornado hit the day before, Sunday, May 26, 2024, in Valley View, Texas.

In the playoffs, he added another eight penalty minutes in four games. “Owen is a puck-moving defender who utilizes his size and reach to disrupt plays,” said Rockets assistant general manager Curtis Hamilton. “We are excited to welcome Owen and his family to the Rockets.” The WHL Scholarship provides players with a year of post-secondary education for each season they play in the WHL. The scholarship covers tuition, fees, and textbooks, allowing players to attend universities, colleges, technical institutes, and trade schools.",

        "content": "Former Germany and Bayern Munich manager Hansi Flick is on the verge of officially becoming the new manager of FC Barcelona, replacing the outbound Xavi Hernandez. For a brief period of time, he was linked with possibly making a return to Bayern to replace Thomas Tuchel, as was Julian Nagelsmann, but Flick wanted to experience a new challenge in a different country for the next chapter of his life. Flick will have a full summer transfer window to help with his squad planning efforts at Barcelona before his first full season in charge of the club, and reports have suggested he is going to be looking towards the Bundesliga for some of his transfer targets. In a market he knows quite well given his time as Bayern’s manager, the German national team manager, and his long tenure as an assistant member of Joachim Löw’s Germany coaching staff. Naturally, there have been rumors that Flick would like to try to bring Bayern’s Joshua Kimmich to Barcelona, but information from Az’s Maximilian Koch (via @iMiaSanMia ) suggests that is not a hot topic at the moment for either club. With the European Championships right around the corner for Germany, that is Kimmich’s full focus at the moment. Photo by Stefan Matzke - sampics/Corbis via Getty Images Kimmich’s current contract at Bayern is set to expire in June 2025, so it is a crucial period for the player in terms of needing to get his future sorted out, whether that is with Bayern, or elsewhere. So far, there have not been concrete talks yet between the player and the club’s front office, though Max Eberl and Christoph Freund will certainly have to open discussions as soon as they can after the Euros have ended. Kimmich does not have an agent and currently represents himself, which should help the contract talk process go smoother as it is a more direct line of communication without the presence of an agent or representatives, but only time will how negotiations will go. He will more than likely have conversations with Vincent Kompany about the upcoming season and where he sees Kimmich in his Bayern side as a part of the contract talk process. The time they are a changin’ at Bayern Munich. Vincent Kompany looks like he is taking over in Bavaria, while the club’s former favorite son — Hansi Flick — is heading to FC Barcelona . Which one will make out better with their new club? We’ll find out, but in the meantime, there could also be some Bayern players who are on Flick’s transfer radar, too. basically, we’ve got a lot to talk about with all of that, plus some appreciation for Bayer Leverkusen’s incredible season.

        "content": "May 27, (THEWILL) – Critical stakeholders in Uyo Senatorial District have taken the lead by unanimously endorsing Umo Eno for a second term in office as Governor of Akwa Ibom State come 2027. The political leaders, under the aegis of the Akwa Ibom North East Consultative Forum, the apex sociopolitical organisation in Uyo Senatorial District, revealed that the confidence vote in the Governor and endorsement for his mandatory seven more years, as the State Chief Executive, followed a thorough assessment of the governor’s performance in his first year in office. According to them, this period has been marked by significant achievements across various sectors, with notable progress in education, agriculture, road infrastructure, youth development, healthcare, security, and many other areas as enshrined in the ARISE Agenda. Leader of the Forum, who is also the Political Leader of Uyo Senatorial District, Senator Effiong Bob, while addressing the stakeholders and Newsmen, who converged on his Uyo abode on Monday, specifically eulogised Governor Umo Eno’s visionary leadership, his commitment to good governance, and his dedication to the welfare of Akwa Ibom people. He emphasised that the Governor has earned the support of all citizens and residents, and therefore, will be re-elected, just like his predecessors – Obong Victor Attah, Chief Godswill Akpabio, and Mr Udom Emmanuel – who all served eight unbroken years as Governors. “In the area of road infrastructure, numerous projects such as the newly inaugurated 3.3km Idua road, the intervention work at the collapsed area of Afia Nsit Road both in Eket, the just inaugurated 160m span Nto Ide Ikot Amba Bridge with 800m Approach road in Obot Akara, the newly commissioned Paul Ekpo Crescent, Emmanuel Ekon Avenue, Obot Emem Street, the commissioning of the reconstructed section of Atiku Abubakar road with walkways, drainage systems solar street lights, with flood control tunnel as well as the Afaha Ube Road, including the Akpan Andem Market in Uyo road, to mention but a few, are all eloquent testimonials to the Governor’s Midas touch in the area road infrastructure. “In the area of Youth and Manpower development, the governor through the Ibom Leadership and Entrepreneurial Development Centre, trained and doled out seed capital to over 800 youths and entrepreneurs as a strategic attempt to fanning the embers of enterprise development. In Healthcare delivery, the governor has already built, and equipped new model healthcare centres and reconstructed existing ones, inaugurated them and handed these facilities to our people for us. In Security management, which is one of the pillars of his ARISE agenda, our visionary leader and Governor, apart from donating utility vehicles to security agencies in the state, has provided the needed support for these agencies to help maintain peace and security in our state. The Governor has also envisioned and launched the IBOM COMMUNITY watch to bolster the job done by existing security agencies. “In Education, the reconstructed, remodelled and inaugurated Christ the King, and Ewet Primary Schools projects, the opening of the flagship Dakkada Skills Acquisition Centre and constitution of the school’s Governing Council, the training of Principals of Public Secondary Schools by UK Education officials, frequent grants to students, donation of school uniforms and sandals to students, among others are some of the very strategic investments Pastor Umo Eno has made in this sector that has earned him the applause and admiration of all Akwa Ibomites. “Today, the songs of mourning that were becoming permanent in the mouths of retirees in Akwa Ibom on account of the unsettled backlog of gratuities have been swiftly replaced with songs of thanksgiving and gratitude owing to the Governor’s swift intervention in clearing the backlog of these gratuities, the former member representing Nigeria in the ECOWAS parliament highlighted. However, based on these achievements and more, the stakeholders, in a motion moved by Hon.

My [Off-Broadway’s ] family knows how to bring the community together!” Bleu, 35, captioned an Instagram video on Sunday, May 27. “Can’t believe it’s been almost 20 years since I’ve done this.” In the clip, the star is jumping rope on a New York City street as his 2007 song “Push It to the Limit” from the Disney Channel Original Movie plays in the background. Bleu starred alongside in the DCOM, which premiered in January 2007. (Bleu is currently starring as Seymour Krelborn in an Off-Broadway production of s.) The film followed the story of Izzy Daniels (Bleu) a teenage boxing prodigy who finds himself on a Double Dutch team coached by longtime friend Mary (Palmer). Throughout the movie, Izzy has to decide if he wants to be a Golden Gloves winner like his father or help his new friends win a regional Double Dutch championship. The film’s director, , told in January 2022 that both Bleu and Palmer, 30, did their own stunts on the film’s set. “What’s just so amazing with that group of actors is that they could do all of that jump roping,” Hoen recalled. “It’s amazingly hard, and all the tricks, they were completely into those and learning how to do them.” Palmer has also looked back at her time making the movie, revealing that she had her first kiss on camera with Bleu. “That was my first kiss in life,” Palmer, 30, said during an interview with in July 2020. “Even though that wasn’t my real first kiss, it was my actual first kiss ... I remember just feeling excited and it was cool because I had a cool person to kiss, Corbin is pretty good looking.” Palmer admitted she was “scared” as well. “The most fun part about this movie was that I was around my peers — people my own age,” she recalled.

        "description": "Per the rankings from Baseball America, he was the Nationals’ No. 1 prospect in three straight years from 2017 to 2019.",
        "content": "The Nationals announced today that outfielder Lane Thomas has been reinstated from the injured list with fellow outfielder Víctor Robles designated for assignment in a corresponding move. The club’s 40-man roster count drops to 38. Robles, now 27, was once the club’s top prospect and one of the top prospects in the entire league. Per the rankings from Baseball America , he was the Nationals’ No. 1 prospect in three straight years from 2017 to 2019. He was also on BA’s top 100 league-wide list from 2016 to 2019, getting as high as No. 5 overall going into 2018. The expectation at that time was that Robles had the capability of being an all-around contributor and a long-term part of the outfield in Washington. Things seemed to be in a good place in 2019, the year the Nats won the World Series. Robles hit 17 home runs and slashed .255/.326/.419. Despite the long balls, his 5.7 percent walk rate kept the on-base low and the wRC+ of 92 indicates he was actually a bit below average offensively overall. But thanks to above-average defense and stealing 28 bases, FanGraphs credited him as being worth 3.7 wins above replacement in his age-22 season. Given his youth, the Nats undoubtedly expected him to continue evolving as a hitter as he aged. Unfortunately, things moved in the opposite direction in the years to come. From 2020 to 2022, Robles got into 291 games with the Nats but hit just .216/.291/.306 in that time for a wRC+ of 66. The club’s fortunes also faded in that time and they entered a rebuilding phase. That theoretically left Robles with plenty of playing time to get back on track, but his health hasn’t really allowed him to do so. He only got into 36 games last year due to back spasms in the lumbar spine. He did perform well when on the field, hitting a solid .299/.385/.364, but hasn’t carried that over in 2024. He spent about a month on the injured list due to left hamstring strain and has produced a brutal line of .120/.281/.120 in the 14 games he has played. Robles was slated to reach free agency after the 2024 campaign and the Nationals were likely hoping for a nice run of play this season, at least allowing them to flip Robles for something at the deadline before he slipped away from them for nothing. Unfortunately, his performance hasn’t inspired much confidence and they are cutting him off the roster today. They will now have a week to trade him or pass him through waivers, though any interest is likely to be fairly modest after years of poor performance and injury absences. He’s making a salary of $2.65M this year, with still about two-thirds of that left to be paid out. Perhaps the Nats will try to eat some of that money to facilitate a deal but it’s also possible that Robles just ends up released. He has enough service time that he can reject an outright assignment in favor of free agency while keeping all that money intact. It’s undeniably been a disappointing few years and hardly what the club had in mind, given the prospect pedigree and the promising start to his career. But for Robles personally, it’s not too late for him to find a second act somewhere. He just turned 27 last week and could perhaps get back on track with a run of good health and the right opportunity.

        "description": "Thiruvananthapuram mourns the loss of Manu, a beloved Bengal tiger at the local zoo. His 17-year journey symbolizes the importance of conservation efforts. Despite facing health challenges, Manu's legacy inspires future generations to appreciate and protect wildlife. The zoo reaffirms its commitment to animal welfare and raising awareness about endangered species. Manu's passing marks the end of an era but underscores the interconnectedness of all living beings and our responsibility to safeguard their future.",
        "content": "In the early hours of a serene morning in Thiruvananthapuram, the city awoke to the somber news that Manu , the venerable Bengal tiger who had been a part of the local zoo 's family for 17 years, had passed away. The news spread quickly, touching the hearts of the community and wildlife enthusiasts alike. Manu's story is one that began on January 13, 2007, when he was born to his mother Karishma at the zoo. Over the years, he grew to become a majestic creature, admired by visitors and cared for by the dedicated staff. His presence was a constant, a familiar sight for those who frequented the zoo, and he was often the highlight of many a visitor's trip. However, in December 2023, it became apparent that Manu was facing health challenges. He was diagnosed with liver-related issues, and despite the best efforts of the veterinary team led by Dr. Nikesh Kiran, his condition began to deteriorate. In his final months, Manu was fed boneless mutton, soup, and milk, a diet designed to ease his discomfort and provide him with the necessary nutrients. As Manu aged, his resilience waned. The zoo staff made accommodations to ensure his comfort, moving him to a special cage equipped with infrared lighting to maintain warmth. Yet, even with this care, the tiger's health continued to decline, and he eventually succumbed to pneumonia, a complication arising from his underlying condition. The loss of Manu is felt deeply by the Thiruvananthapuram zoo community. He was a symbol of the wild's beauty and the delicate balance of nature's ecosystems. His passing marks the end of an era for the zoo and is a poignant moment to reflect on the importance of conservation efforts for these magnificent creatures. Tigers, in general, have an average lifespan of around 12 years in the wild, but in captivity, they can live longer due to the absence of threats and the availability of consistent care. Manu's 17-year journey is in due part to the care he received and the bond he shared with those who looked after him. The zoo's commitment to providing a safe haven for animals like Manu is unwavering. While the void left by his departure cannot be filled, the legacy of his life will continue to inspire and educate future generations about the wonders and vulnerabilities of wildlife. Manu's final rites were conducted with respect and in accordance with the regulations of the National Tiger Conservation Authority . As the zoo and its patrons mourn his loss, they also celebrate the life of a tiger that brought joy and awe to so many. In the wake of this event, the zoo reaffirms its dedication to the welfare of its inhabitants and to raising awareness about the plight of endangered species. The memory of Manu will live on, urging us to appreciate and protect the diverse array of life with which we share our planet. His story, while unique, is part of a larger narrative that highlights the interconnectedness of all living beings and the responsibility we hold to safeguard their future.",

        "content": "Patricia Warren, a longtime trustee of both the Marin County Board of Education and the Novato Unified School District, died Tuesday. She was 84. Ms. Warren, an advocate for women’s rights and the namesake of an treatment center for women who were victims of domestic violence, died of complications from a massive stroke, according to her son Mark Warren, a Colorado resident. “She was an amazing woman who cared very deeply for her community,” he said. “She did everything she could to make positive changes for people’s lives.” Ms. Warren, a Novato resident, was born near Boston on Feb. 29, 1940, to Mitchell Anderson, a founding pilot of Northeast Airlines, and Mary Coggins. She received a bachelor’s degree in 1961 from Sweetbriar College in Virginia. After college, she married Robert Warren, her sweetheart since 10th grade at Arlington High School, in 1962. The couple were married for 62 years. Her husband is a retired civil engineer and was an engineering manager for the Golden Gate Bridge. On June 30, 2022, Ms. Warren retired from her seat on the county education board, where she had served for 35 years. Prior to that, she was a trustee at Novato Unified School District for nine years. “While we are saddened by her passing, we also take this time to acknowledge and celebrate her good work that changed countless lives for the better and that will be felt for generations to come,” John Carroll, Marin superintendent of schools, said in a letter to the education community. Noting Ms. Warren’s “remarkable 44-year commitment to education,” Carroll described her as a “fearless, passionate, and tireless advocate for those in our schools and community most in need of extra services and support.” “She believed that every child deserves the best possible education,” Carroll said. “She was especially supportive of the students in alternative education served through Marin’s Community School and other programs.” Ms. Warren’s career included roles as a staff member at Planned Parenthood and Marin Abused Women’s Services, and as the coordinator of the Marin Women’s Commission and co-founder of the Marin Women’s Hall of Fame. “From championing the rights of children in alternative and special education, to being an early advocate for policies ensuring equity in pay and hiring practices for women, there are many significant and lasting examples of Pat’s leadership and good work,” Carroll said. In the late 1970s, Ms. Warren was a staff member at Marin Abused Women’s Services and was also a Rape Crisis Center board member. It was later known as Community Violence Solutions. In 2003, the organization dedicated the Patricia Warren Center of Community Violence Solutions, recognizing her work on behalf of women, children and families. Ms. Warren “steadfastly stood against violence, sex discrimination and injustice,” the organization’s announcement said at the time. Mary Jane Burke, former Marin superintendent of schools, said Ms. Warren also supported education projects to help youths with substance abuse problems, special needs or alternative education and regional occupational programs. “Through budget cuts and budget windfalls, staff layoffs and staff hiring, program take-back and program development, Pat never lost sight of trying to do what was best for students and families while also meeting the needs of local districts,” Burke said when Ms. Warren stepped down from the county board of education. In addition to her husband and son, Ms. Warren is survived by another son, Michael Warren, a resident of the Lake Tahoe area. Memorial services are pending.",

        "content": "The deadline for applying for the post of Team India's head coach has ended on Monday. Following that, the Board of Control for Cricket in India and its top name, chose to be silent. After the Kolkata Knight Riders' IPL 2024 triumph, the name of Gautam Gambhir is getting more attention. With both parties not commenting anything on the matter, it seems that the Indian board doesn't have too many options available for the position. ADVERTISEMENT Currently, most of the Indian team players have travelled to New York for the T20 World Cup 2024 under the guidance of head coach Rahul Dravid. The only thing confirmed is that no foreign player has applied for the position after the board's secretary Jay Shah clarified that the Board is looking at someone who has risen through the ranks and knows the domestic structure. It could be safe to say that the board's primary target was who is currently the head of National Cricket Academy. But the veteran seems to be least interested in a full-time position which demands him to be available for 10 months a year. \"The deadline is fine, but the BCCI brass wouldn't mind taking some more time before reaching a decision. Right now, the team will be busy with World T20 for the better part of the month of June. After that seniors will be rested from tours of Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe where any of the NCA-based senior coaches can accompany the team. So what's the hurry,\" a BCCI source told PTI on conditions of anonymity. Also, KKR principal owner Shah Rukh Khan shares a deep bond with Gautam Gambhir and it is not easy to leave an IPL team which has been a part of the identity of the former India opener. There's another aspect that needs to be looked into seriously what senior India players, currently in New York, feel about whether Gambhir can indeed be Rahul Dravid's replacement.",

Ashok Korsa (25) was apprehended on Monday from Bazarpara area under the Farsegarh police limits, an official said, reported PTI. Korsa, who carried a bounty of Rs 10,000, was involved in an IED blast attack on the vehicle of a police officer on May 15, he said.

The duo carried a reward of Rs 1 lakh each, he said. As per the PTI report, the two were involved in an attack on security personnel in the forest near Gundam village in February this year. Three Naxalites, including two women, were killed in an encounter with security personnel in Maharashtra's Gadchiroli district on Monday, authorities said. According to Superintendent of Police Neelotpal, intelligence sources indicate that members of the Naxalites' Perimili Dalam were plotting subversive actions in a forest near Katrangatta hamlet in Bhamragad taluka during their ongoing Tactical Counter Offensive Campaign (TCOC), reported PTI. According to the report, responding to the intelligence, two units of , the Gadchiroli police's specialised combat wing, were dispatched to conduct a search operation in the region.

Additionally, security authorities recovered an AK-47 weapon, a carbine, an INSAS rifle, Naxal literature, and other items from the site. The anti-Naxal operation is still ongoing in the area, as Naxalites normally increase their activity during the TCOC season from March to June, hoping to build their ranks and launch large attacks on security troops because of limited forest cover, the PTI report further stated.",

        "content": "NEW DELHI: NIA, as part of a multi-state crackdown on organised trafficking syndicates engaged in luring Indian youths with false promise of jobs in Cambodia, Laos, Golden Triangle SEZ and forcing them to work in cyber fraud centres there, arrested five persons on Monday after raiding 15 locations across 7 states and Union territories (UTs). Among the states/UTs where NIA carried out the searches in coordination with the local police and intelligence agencies, were Maharashtra, UP, Bihar, Gujarat, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab & Chandigarh. Eight fresh FIRs were registered and five accused — Manish Hingu of Vadodara, Pahlad singh of Gopalganj, Nabialam Ray of south west Delhi, Balwant Kataria of Gurugram and Sartaj Singh of Chandigarh — arrested. NIA investigations have revealed the accused to be involved in an organised trafficking syndicate engaged in luring and trafficking Indian youth to foreign countries on the false promises of legal employment. The youths were being forced to work in fake call centers at Laos, Golden Triangle SEZ, and Cambodia, among other places, as part of the racket, controlled and operated mainly by foreign nationals. They were coerced into undertaking illegal activities online, such as credit card fraud, investments in cryptocurrency using fake applications, honey trapping etc. Investigations have further revealed that the arrested accused were coordinating with traffickers operating from across the international border to facilitate illegal border-crossing of Indian youth from Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam to Laos SEZ. They were working at the behest of foreign-based agents belonging to well organised syndicates that were active in several districts of Maharashtra, UP, Bihar, Gujrat, Delhi, Punjab, Haryana etc . These syndicates were further connected to operatives based in other parts of India, as well as foreign countries like UAE, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos SEZ etc. NIA had taken over the relevant case from Mumbai police on May 13, 2024. It found that the human trafficking syndicate was not operating merely in Mumbai but had linkages with other facilitators and traffickers in various parts of the country and across the border. The searches on Saturday led to the seizure of several incriminating materials including documents, digital devices, handwritten registers, multiple passports, bogus overseas employment letters etc, said NIA.",

        "content": "You want down-home... Potter Valley, Saturday morning...folks lined up and down Main Street, young and old and in-between, with nary a head without a cowboy hat upon it. I made sure to wear my old Shady Grady. It’s Memorial Day Weekend and the Potter Valley Spring Festival and Rodeo — over 77 years and going strong — first held in 1946 and a major fundraiser for many of the local non-profits and churches in town, takes over the town. The parade, sponsored by the Potter Valley Youth and Community Center, led by the rodeo queen and her entourage, begins a bit after 11 a.m. This year’s theme, Blue Jeans and Country Dreams, was well represented on a few of the floats but none so uniquely as the group of young horsewomen from White Dog Ranch, parade winners, whose horses’ front legs were fully be-jeaned. The parade kept coming with Jim Eddy pulling a float of happy family campers, a small flotilla of back-packing goats, a festive C&S. Waste Solutions garbage truck, about eight fire trucks with their horns a-blaring, P.V. FFA, a Save Lake Pillsbury float, Kudos for Kids on a 1952 Chevy truck with less than 20,000 miles on it, the P.V. Bible Church, a bunch of raucous Dolly Parton look-a-likes, the Pauli Family 1948 power wagon float, and more, including 7-year-old Red Bluff Junior Roundup Little Miss whose favorite thing is branding cows. She looks to have been born in the saddle. Potter Valley Youth and Community Center began sponsoring the parade back in, oh, about 2008, and Sheri Burris, director and program coordinator with PVYCC and one of the key organizers of the parade, a 60-year P.V. resident, born and raised here, remembers her mother and her best friend dressing up as clowns back in the ’70s, pulling a wagon and throwing candy. “Nobody knew who they were.” I told her this was the most down-home parade I’d ever seen. “That just warms my heart,” she says. “We’re behind the scenes and don’t always know how it’s received. This is one community event that brings people together and also brings people from out of town who used to live here. It warms my heart that it’s still going strong after all these years.” Back towards Hoppers Corner and into the rodeo grounds, the ax throwing and wood cutting competitions are up next. Ian Blundell, West Coast amateur timber sports competitor, overseeing the ax throwing competition, explains that each contestant gets four throws, and the three best are counted, one-handed or two-handed. “In the middle, the bullseye, we have the beer can, so if you pop it, you get a free drink,” he says. The arena gets quiet for the Star-Spangled Banner and soon after final adjustments are being made to the log decks and chain saws are being fired up for the wood cutting competition. Bobby Johnson, who is competing on the Johnson’s Quality Tree Care team with his father Kurt and brother KC, takes the time to explain how it works. Six log decks have been set up with five or six, 8-foot-long tan oak logs. The goal is to cut the logs into 14-18-inch rounds, split them and stack them. They have to be split in a certain way: at the widest point they can be no bigger than 9 inches and no smaller than 3 1⁄2 inches. If they are bigger or smaller, those pieces are disqualified. The goal is to get as many pieces as possible; they don’t necessarily have to be big. It’s timed at 12 minutes. And there’s nice looking belt buckles for the winners. Each three-man team gets one chain saw and two splitting mauls; if you break a maul, you’re out of luck. I ask Bobby if it’s his dad’s last year. “It’s his last year if he wins.” Year 34 for Kurt Johnson, he’s won about 50 percent of them. He and his son KC won last year and in 2014, the three family men won the championship. “It keeps me young and my boys keep me young. It if weren’t for them, I wouldn’t do it anymore. It’s a long 12 minutes. I’ll do it one more time,” he says. But Bobby said it’s your last time if you win. “This is it for sure.” Joe Goeken competing with Derick and Dustin Trimble, The Trimble Brothers Construction, has been competing since1996 and he’s won a number of times, missing only during his years in Iraq and a year in Japan with the Marine Corps. “It’s the most intense 12 minutes you’ll ever have. It’s a butt kicker; no matter what kind of shape you’re in going into it, it’ll kick your butt every time... but you always come back for more.” As time for sign up is getting close, 21-year-old Kieran Keaney, from Petaluma, shows up for the ax throw, looks over and decides, as a complete neophyte to the competition but not to log splitting, he’s going to enter. However, he’s in shorts and needs two teammates and a pair of jeans to compete. Pretty soon, not thwarted by size of the competitors or the depth of their experience, he’s got it together and ready to go with a pair of jeans, two more team members and equipment loaned from the Johnson family — Team Chainsaw. Hog Wild Farms enters bringing the total to four teams, the countdown begins and its two sets of competition, two teams per session. It is indeed a very intense 12 minutes. Final score: Trimble Construction 227, Johnson Quality Tree Care 184, Hog Wild Farms, 134; and Team Chainsaw 103.",

        "content": "Mixed reactions have continued to trail the one year anniversary of President Bola Tinubu’s administration with knocks and praises by some Nigerians. Tinubu was inaugurated as the 16th President of Nigeria on May 29, 2023. Some residents of Okitipupa in Ondo State who spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday, commended Tinubu for his efforts at fixing the nation’s economy, while others said that he had failed Nigerians because of their high expectations from him. While calling on Tinubu to search for competent hands, the respondents urged him to rejig his for optimal performance. Mrs Morenike Alaka, a former Chairman, Okitipupa Local Government, told NAN that Tinubu was not the genesis of the current economic woes being experienced by Nigerians, saying it was an inherited problem. Alaka noted that it was not possible to fix the current situation of the country without effecting some policies that would be unfavourable to Nigerians in the short-term but would be beneficial in the long-term. “We just need to cooperate and continue to pray for this government, and I can assure you that what we are facing right now are just measures which is hard now but we will enjoy in the long run,” she said. Mr Niyi Adesokan, Chairman, Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE), Okitipupa Local Government Chapter, also said that Tinubu was only trying to fix the economy, adding that most of the problems being experienced “are only teething problems which shall vade out very soon.” He added that the immediate past government destroyed so many things “especially on borrowing which is literally having negative effects on the country and her currency. “On the issue of the local government autonomy, Tinubu has shown commitment to putting this in place in every local government with a view to ensuring development at the grassroots. Once the autonomy is given, you will see vast development from the grassroots,” he said. However, Dr Dipo Akomolafe, a former Chairman, Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) at the Olusegun Agagu University of Science and Technology (OAUSTECH), Okitipupa, said “the first one year of Tinubu’s administration has been a challenging one to individuals and the nation at large”. According to him, Nigerians are finding it extremely difficult to feed and shelter, while people can no longer afford the means of transportation. Akomolafe, who noted that the education sector was also adversely affected, said the health and welfare of staff of tertiary institutions were stagnated through inadequate budgetary allocation which, according to him, is hampering them from performing their core roles of research. He said that “though the country is truly blessed with abundant mineral resources, our focus all along has been oil; a gift that has significantly contributed to the economy of Nigeria as a whole. “In order to achieve development, it is imperative that we diversify and institutionalise foundational economic frameworks to fully reap the blessings of oil itself and focus on other resources and agriculture.” Also, Mr Larry Ogunmusire, a People’s Democratic Party stalwart, who described Tinubu’s one year administration as very challenging, noted that his economic policies brought more pains to Nigerians. He added that power and the defence sectors were badly hit as many Nigerians have not been enjoying eight hours electricity in the last one year, while many can no longer sleep with their two eyes closed for fear of being kidnapped. According to him, the subsidy removal by Tinubu during his inaugural speech, affects the economy leading to untold hardship in the country. “I think he needs to change his economic policies and rejig his cabinet, and replace non performing ministers with people of track records and high profiles who can help drive the economy,” Ogunmusire said. Also Mr Temidayo Temola, Chairman, Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Universities (SSANU), OAUSTECH Chapter, said that Tinubu’s government has not renewed the hope of Nigerians as encapsulated in his campaign manifesto. He said that in the last one year, the astronomical increase in prices of goods and services is not only frustrating but killing “as many of what the masses could afford are no longer affordable. “On the education sector, nothing has significantly improved as non payment of the withheld salaries of the university staff has remained a forlorn hope. “The president and his team have to sit right and find a lasting solution to the myriad of problems ranging from food, exchange rate, security, power and agriculture, among others, are resolved,” Temola said.

        "description": "One small step for man, one giant leap for bacon lovers everywhere. Here's how Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin ended up eating bacon during the moon landing.",
        "content": "When Apollo 11 landed on the moon on July 20, 1969, it was a momentous occasion. Upwards of 650 million people around the world sat in stunned silence and anticipation as two American astronauts took their first steps on Earth's satellite planet. When Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin went back to the lunar module after their initial exploration, it wouldn't have surprised anyone if they feasted on dehydrated surf and turf, with glasses of floating champagne in celebration, but it wasn't beef or lobster on their plates, it was bacon. Any bacon lover would agree that the salty, crunchy, porky, fatty food is completely appropriate for celebratory occasions (or any occasion, really), but the pork product likely wasn't chosen to be part of the astronauts' meal plan because they requested it. Rather, it traveled well in space. Figuring out which foods could be transported into and consumed in low-gravity conditions was just one large piece of the space travel puzzle for NASA scientists to figure out before Apollo 11. Foods had to meet weight and volume limits, stay safe and edible without refrigeration, not be overly crumbly (fine crumbs could affect equipment), and offer enough calories and nutrition for the astronauts. Bacon checked all the boxes, as did peaches, strawberry cubes, and grape and orange drinks, which rounded out the meal Armstrong and Aldrin dined on after their moonwalk. Space food had already come a long way By the time of the Apollo missions, scientists and astronauts had already been testing edibles in space during the prior Mercury and Gemini missions. Fast-forward to the 1969 moon landing, and the food wasn't bad, by comparison. During the Project Mercury flights, much of the food astronauts ate came in paste form, in toothpaste-like tubes. In April 1961, Soviet pilot and cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to fly to space, and he feasted on beef and liver paste in a tube. Yum. During the Gemini missions, cosmic culinary arts had improved, with an emphasis put on freeze-drying and dehydrating foods for space flights. The foods could be placed in packages in which water could be inserted for rehydration. During the Apollo years, the foods' packaging was similar to those during Gemini, but the variety was greater. Foods in the pilots' meal plans included cornflakes, scrambled eggs, hot dogs, spaghetti, tuna salad, and peanut butter. Coffee was also placed on the menu — and if you ask me, what could be better than coffee and bacon, with a view of planet Earth to go with it? Is bacon still on the microgravity menu? During Apollo 13, astronaut Jim Lovell reportedly told mission control, \"Happiness is bacon squares for breakfast.\" The appreciation for bacon is clearly out of this world, yet, someone, somewhere (likely a brainiac at NASA) decided bacon didn't need to be a food option for astronauts anymore. Although the food list has grown from fewer than 70 foods in the Apollo era to over 200 today, bacon is noticeably missing. The closest thing space travelers will find are sausage patties. Of course, one hardly becomes an astronaut for the food, and it's a good thing they don't have to squeeze meat paste from a tube anymore, but, seriously NASA, bacon can't take up that much room aboard, can it? Things are a bit different at the International Space Station, which has refrigeration and freezing capabilities. Here, visitors will find bacon and a large variety of meals, fresh fruits, desserts, dairy items, and snacks. Recommended",

        "content": "Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in the 2023 general elections, has explained what will make him consider a merger between the LP and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ahead of the 2023 general elections. Obi spoke in an interview on Noire TV-Global Black TV during the weekend. He also reacted to the possibility of being supported as a southeast candidate in the 2027 presidential election by Atiku Abubakar, which he said he appreciated. Obi said: “I commend him. And I’m grateful for his statements. Especially where he said he will support me if it (the presidential ticket) goes to the South-East.” The former Anambra State governor, however, noted that his primary concern is not personal ambition or political maneuvering, but rather the well-being of Nigeria and its people. “I’m not desperate to be president. I’m desperate to see Nigeria work, especially for the poor people because we have a lot of potential”, Obi said. On the potential merger between the PDP and LP, Obi said he is open to the idea, provided that the goal is to better govern Nigeria and unlock its vast potential. “If the merger is to be able to govern Nigeria properly, unlock all those things that will make Nigeria a better place, I’m for it,” he said, adding that he has no interest in mergers or alliances solely to secure power or win elections.

I don’t want to be part of anything like that,” he said. According to him, unity and cooperation among individuals and parties is a welcome development, only if the objective is to build a better Nigeria. Peter Obi said: “It might be at the party level, it might be at the individual level. Might be at any level. But we must come together to be able to build a better Nigeria.” Opinions Balanced, fearless journalism driven by data comes at huge financial costs.

        "content": "It was another impressive outing for 35-year-old left-hander Chris Sale . Sale (8-1), struck out eight while pitching seven innings of one-run ball. Sale has reformed his game that earned him seven consecutive All-Star selections from 2012-18 before injuries caught up to him. “Just doing what I need to do,” Sale said to The Canadian Press. “We all have our part on the team. Just posting every fifth day and trying to keep runs off the board. Take every start, you want to win. Had a couple of rough ones over the last couple of days. You want to end on a good note heading back home.” Ending on a good note, indeed. Sale has a 2.22 ERA in nine starts. He went into Sunday’s start at Pittsburgh on a six-game winning streak where he’s put up a 1.15 ERA with 50 strikeouts and only three walks in 39 innings. That success of late, according to JayHayKid, has Sale joining Fergie Jenkins (1971) as the only pitcher to ever go 7-0 with 50+ strikeouts and four or fewer walks over a seven-start span. Chris Sale joins Fergie Jenkins (1971) as the only pitchers ever to go 7-0 with 50+ K and 4 or fewer BB over a 7-start span. — nugget chef (@jayhaykid) May 27, 2024 Chris Sale Looks Like Himself Again Sale’s last healthy season goes back to 2017. He finished second in the American League Cy Young Award voting after going 17-8 with a 2.90 ERA and led the majors with 308 strikeouts and 214 1/3 innings in 32 starts. He might not able to replicate that season, but Sale has been one of the best surprising stories this season. “It’s even more so once you get to know the person, get to the competitor, get to know really what he’s all about,” Braves pitching coach Rick Kranitz said. “He threw the ball the other day and was unbelievably good. He came in and he’s saying, just between me and him, stuff like, ‘How ’bout those plays (Austin) Riley made?’ ‘How ’bout the catch that so-and-so made.’ You know what I mean? I said, ‘Well how ’bout the guy that struck out 10?’ “But it just shows, he’s very giving, he’s thoughtful to his teammates. He’s as good of a teammate, I think, as you will ever have.” First @Braves pitcher since 2003 to win seven consecutive starts. Chris Sale reached the mark in his first 10 outings for Atlanta. pic.twitter.com/w59UrpUjZ2 — Bally Sports: Braves (@BravesOnBally) May 26, 2024 Losing Spencer Strider to season-ending elbow surgery hurt the Braves. But, they are happy that Sale and Max Fried are getting the job done. Fried, who has a 2.01 ERA, has opposing hitters batting .162 in his past eight starts . Behind those two is Reynaldo López , who has a 1.75 ERA with a 2-2 record. It’s no secret that the pitching is carrying much more of the load than last year. For someone like Sale, he’s been important in that effort both on and off the field. “It’s great, because he has a lot of wisdom,” Krantz said. “Which really helps everybody. Young guys, the older guys. You put that on how hard he’s worked due to injuries, so he can offer that to our guys. You know, he’s at a different level than a lot of pitchers in this game. He’s been through a lot, he’s won a World Series, All-Star Games, and he’s still very humble.” This article first appeared on Last Word On Sports and was syndicated with permission.",

        "content": "is one of the biggest artists in the entire world, Overall, the same can be said of other massive artists like , , and . Well, according to , all of these artists were the over the weekend. In fact, one song in particular caught the attention of fans. This song is about eight years old and is called \"Can U Be.\" It is a collaboration between Kanye and Travis Scott, with the full song making the rounds on Twitter, Sunday evening. As per HHNM's reporting, there was a Group Buy that was started by someone on Discord. For those who are not familiar, a Group Buy is a group auction of sorts with a set goal. In this case, the goal was $25,000. If the goal was reached, then all of the music would get leaked to the group. Well, the goal was reached extremely fast. In fact, there were some people willing to donate thousands of dollars on an individual level. That is a lot of money, but leaks have always proven to be valuable. It was noted that among these leaks are actual stems, which means producers can do as they please with the tracks. Moreover, some of the songs that were leaked have already released, however, these are simply alternate versions. Needless to say, if you are a music nerd or a super fan, there is going to be a lot here for you to digest. However, we do not recommend engaging with leaks. If the artist wanted you to hear these songs, they would have released them by now. Let us know what you think about this leak, in the comments section down below. Do you believe that these kinds of leaks are immoral? What do you think music fans should do when confronted with these kinds of leaks? Ignore them? Or go ahead and listen? Additionally, stay tuned to for the latest news and updates from around the music world. We will always be sure to keep you informed on all of your favorite artists and their upcoming projects.

Sri Lanka Police revealed that the wanted suspect, identified as Osmand Gerrard – a resident of Dematagoda, often changes his appearances, and these are some of his appearances that detectives suspect he may be using now, Newsfirst news portal reported. Sri Lanka Police recently announced a cash award of Rs. 2 million for any credible information on the whereabouts of the wanted suspect. The Gujarat Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) on May 19 arrested four Sri Lankans with links to the ISIS at the Sardar Vallabhai Patel airport in Ahmedabad. The ATS also seized three pistols and cartridges abandoned at a location in Ahmedabad based on geo-coordinates and seized a mobile phone from their possession. The four men had taken an Indigo flight out of Colombo to Chennai on May 19. Among the arrested individuals, Mohammed Nusrat is a businessman involved in importing telecommunication devices and electrical equipment from countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Dubai, the news portal said. Nusrat operated within Colombo, where he sold these imported goods. Mohammad Nafran, 27, who was also arrested, has been identified as the son of the first wife of Niyas Naufer aka ‘Potta Naufer’ the notorious underworld criminal who was sentenced to death for the killing of High Court Judge Sarath Ambepitiya. The other two Sri Lankans are 35-year-old Mohammad Faris from Maligawatte, Colombo and 43-year-old Mohammad Rashdeen from Colombo 13. Mohammad Faris had worked as a ‘Nattami’ or cart puller in Pettah, and was arrested by the Colombo Crimes Division on March 11, 2023, and November 1 of the same year. On May 21, his close associate Hameed Amir was arrested by the Terrorist Investigations Division. Mohammad Faris had left for Chennai, India on May 19. The other suspect is Mohammad Rashdeen, a three-wheeler driver. Security forces suspect that he is linked to trafficking crystal meth, or ICE. On September 16, 2022, Rashdeen was arrested by the Foreshore Police and was later released on bail. Last week, the Sri Lankan authorities launched a high-powered operation to investigate the four Sri Lankans arrested in Gujarat.",

        "content": "NEW DELHI: India's bowlers Yuzvendra Chahal and Avesh Khan departed to join the first group of the Men in Blue squad in New York ahead of the ICC T20 World Cup , which begins on June 1. Star spinner Chahal, who had an impressive IPL 2024 season with the Rajasthan Royals, taking 18 wickets, is part of the World Cup squad. Pacer Avesh Khan will accompany the team as a reserve player. At the Mumbai airport, Avesh was seen on a video call with fellow reserve player Rinku Singh . On Sunday, the first batch of Indian players, including skipper Rohit Sharma, pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, and top-ranked T20I batter Suryakumar Yadav, left for the United States. Among those spotted at the airport were head coach Rahul Dravid, batting coach Vikram Rathour, batter Shubman Gill, all-rounders Ravindra Jadeja and Shivam Dube, pacers Mohammed Siraj, Arshdeep Singh, and Khaleel Ahmed, along with spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel. Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sanju Samson, who recently ended their IPL campaign with Rajasthan Royals after a loss to Sunrisers Hyderabad, and Kolkata Knight Riders' batter Rinku Singh, along with star batter Virat Kohli, whose Royal Challengers Bangalore team lost to RR in the eliminator, have not joined the squad yet. India will kick off their T20 World Cup campaign on June 5 against Ireland at the newly constructed Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York. The much-anticipated clash between India and Pakistan is set for June 9. Following this, India will face co-hosts USA on June 12 and Canada on June 15 to conclude their Group A matches. India aims to end their ICC trophy drought, having last won the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013. Since then, they have reached the 50-over World Cup final in 2023, semifinals in 2015 and 2019, the ICC World Test Championship final in 2021 and 2023, the T20 WC final in 2014, and semifinals in 2016 and 2022, but have not secured a major ICC trophy. India will strive to win their first T20 World Cup title since their victory in the inaugural edition in 2007 in South Africa. In the last edition held in Australia in 2022, India lost to England by 10 wickets in the semifinals.

        "content": "People across Moray were astonished when a big dark cloud appeared today, and then unleashed a huge downpour upon Elgin. Press and Journal photographer Jason Hedges captured the moment the heavens opened on camera. One moment it was a pleasant late spring day – the next Mother Nature did her best. The cloud formed over Elgin before it drifted eastwards bringing a huge downpour. Elgin started out on the Bank Holiday with sunshine between 7am and 10am, when the dark cloud appeared. The said the temperature at the time of the downfall was 15C, and the sun with showers had returned by about 1pm, with humidity rising to 83% by 3pm. On social media, Elgin folks reacted to the cloud and the downpour. One said it was like “the dementors of Harry Potter have arrived” while others wanted to get home in time to take in their washing on the drying line. are called altostratus and appear as grey or bluish-grey sheets of cloud that partially or cover the sky at mid-levels. Even though they cover the sky, you can typically still see the sun as a dimly lit disk behind them – as proved in Elgin earlier. But not enough sun to cast shadows on the ground. Altostratus clouds tend to form ahead of a warm or occluded front. But they can also occur together with cumulus at a cold front. A was issued for north and north-east as residents braced for 11 hours of rain. Residents in the north and north-east were warned of “slow-moving rain and thunderstorms in the area.”",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — President Biden honored America’s fallen troops Monday at Arlington National Cemetery — saying in a Memorial Day speech that Americans must be “keepers of their mission” while reminiscing about his own son’s death from brain cancer . “Today, we’re not just fortunate heirs of their legacy, we have a responsibility to be the keepers of their mission — that truest memorial to their lives: the actions we take every day to ensure that our democracy endures,” the 81-year-old president said after laying a wreath at the military cemetery. Biden, whose son Beau died in 2015 , said that he understood the grief of families in attendance for the annual event, and noted the expansion of veteran health treatment under the PACT Act, which he signed in 2022. “I know it hurts. The hurt is still real, still raw. This week marks nine years since I lost my son, Beau,” Biden said. “Our losses are not the same. He didn’t perish on the battlefield. He was a cancer victim from a consequence of being in the Army in Iraq for a year next to a burn pit — a major in the US National Army, National Guard, living and working by too many besides that toxic burn pit,” he continued. “And as it is for so many of you, the pain of his loss is with me every day, as it is with you — still sharp, still clear, but so is the pride I feel in his service, as if I can still hear him saying, ‘It’s my duty, Dad, it’s my duty,'” he went on. “Duty, that was the code of my son live by and the creed all of you live by — the creed that generations of service members have followed into battle. On the grounds around us lie fallen heroes from every major conflict in history, to defend our independence, to preserve our union, to defeat fascism, to build powerful alliances, forged in the fires of two world wars.” Morning Report and Evening Update: Your source for today's top stories Please provide a valid email address.

Biden, who is preparing for a trip to Normandy next month to commemorate the US military’s role in the invasion of Nazi-occupied France, noted that American troops “80 years ago next week took to the beaches of Normandy and liberated a continent and literally saved the world.” “Decade after decade, tour after tour, these warriors fought for our freedom and the freedom of others, because freedom has never been guaranteed,” he said. “Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few and the rights of many.” Biden added that “our democracy is more than just a system of a government. It’s the very soul of America. It’s how we’ve been able to constantly adapt through the centuries.”",

        "content": "Google ’s Find My Device app on Android is set to get updated with a new feature that will help users to login to the app more easily. The tech giant has already started rolling out the upgraded version of the Find My Device network for some Android users. Android trackers that will use this network and compete with Apple’s AirTags which users will be able to manage through the app are also expected to arrive soon. Currently, the Find My Device app needs users to enter their account password every time they open it. However, this frequent account password requirements slows down the Find My Device app’s sign-in process which may become annoying for some users. Google is reportedly exploring other ways of making the process easier, and biometric unlocks may help the company solve the issue. According to a report by Android Authority, a tipster named Assemble Debug managed to enable a biometric login option for the updated Find My Device app. The report also noted that the tipster was also able to enable the remote lock functionality within the latest Google Play Services . Find My Device has allowed users to lock and erase their phones for years now. However, the new Remote Lock functionality will allow users to lock their device with just their phone number and a quick security challenge using any device. The report noted that even though the feature was activated it didn’t work, as the rollout of the same is expected in the coming says. Yet, the report shared a screenshot of the feature. The new Remote Lock feature is expected to reduce people’s worries when they lose their device and realise that they do not immediately remember their account details. Remote Lock will be available to Android 10 and above devices through a Google Play Services update later in the year, the report noted. As per the report, both these feature are currently live within the app as Google is testing them and may release them for the public sometime soon.",

        "content": "NBA legend and Hall of Famer Bill Walton died Monday at 71 years old. The NBA announced his death and noted he was \"surrounded by family\" after \"a prolonged battle with cancer.\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver released a statement that said, in part, \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind ... What I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events—always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" Before he was a champion at the NBA level, Walton was one of the best men's college basketball players in the sport's history. He attended powerhouse UCLA and played three seasons from 1971 to 1974 while building a resume that included two national championships, three Naismith Awards, two Associated Press Player of the Year awards and three consensus All-American selections. Walton was a transcendent collegiate star, and the Portland Trail Blazers jumped at the chance to select him with the No. 1 overall pick of the 1974 NBA draft. It is hard to script a better start to a career than the one Walton enjoyed, as he led the Trail Blazers to their only championship in franchise history in just his third season. As if that wasn't enough, he was the league MVP in his fourth year after finishing second in voting in that third season. Walton led the league in rebounding and blocks during that championship season in 1976-77 and then won NBA Finals MVP while averaging 18.5 points, 19.0 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 3.7 blocks and 1.0 steals per game in the victory over Julius Erving's Philadelphia 76ers. He seemed well on his way to a long and legendary career, but foot injuries undercut much of his peak following that incredible run in Portland. As a result, he missed the 1978-79, 1980-81 and 1981-82 seasons while playing just 14 games in 1979-80 and 33 games in 1982-83 for the San Diego Clippers. To Walton's credit, he carved out a second act of his NBA career as a bench presence for the Boston Celtics. He took home the Sixth Man of the Year in 1985-86 for a Celtics team that won the championship and is largely remembered as one of the best in NBA history. He played just 10 games after that season but was still elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993 and named a member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team following his career. That career alone would have made him a forever memorable figure in the basketball world, but he later became one of the voices of the sport for a generation that was not old enough to have watched him play. Walton became an NBA and college basketball analyst for NBC, CBS, ABC and ESPN. His eccentric approach and catchphrases captured the audience's attention and never failed to amuse even when the games themselves weren't thrilling or close. He won a Sports Emmy in 1991 and was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all-time by the American Sportscaster Association in 2009. Some will remember Walton as one of college basketball's best all-time players, some will remember him as a champion and MVP for the Trail Blazers, some will remember him for his supporting role on Larry Bird's Celtics, and others will remember him as a broadcaster who seemed to enjoy every moment on air. He is one of basketball's most enduring figures, and he is survived by his wife and four children.",

        "content": "by: Cameron Kiszla Posted: May 27, 2024 / 10:23 AM PDT Updated: May 27, 2024 / 11:11 AM PDT UCLA great and NBA Hall of Famer Bill Walton has died at the age of 71, the NBA announced Monday. The accomplished center died of cancer, according to ESPN NBA insider Adrian Wojnarowski , who cited the league as his source. In a statement, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver called Walton “truly one of a kind,” citing his impact both on the court and in the broadcast booth, “where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans.” “But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” ESPN college basketball announcer Bill Walton poses for a photo during a college basketball game between the Syracuse Orange and the Gonzaga Bulldogs on day two of the Allstate Maui Invitational at the SimpliFi Arena at Stan Sheriff Center on Nov. 21, 2023, in Honolulu, Hawaii.

(Mansoor Ahmed/Getty Images) Bill Walton during recording session for upcoming video game, Sept. 2, 2001 in San Diego, California. (Getty Images/Bob Riha, Jr.) Walton starred at UCLA under legendary coach John Wooden. The pair won national championships in 1972 and 1973, and Walton was thrice the national college player of the year. “A true Bruin legend that will forever be missed,” UCLA Athletics wrote on X, formerly Twitter . “We send our condolences to the Walton family.” Current UCLA coach Mick Cronin added that “it’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball.” “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality,” Cronin said in a news release . “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories, and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind, and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him. Our athletics department, our team and this university will miss him dearly.” In the professional ranks, he played for the Portland Trail Blazers, the San Diego and Los Angeles Clippers, and the Boston Celtics. He was a two-time NBA champion and winner of the league’s Most Valuable Player award in 1978. Aside from his time on the court, Walton, a native of La Mesa in San Diego County, was known for his love of jam bands, particularly the Grateful Dead, and was often sporting a tie-dyed or Hawaiian shirt while broadcasting basketball games. Despite what the NBA called “a prolonged battle with cancer,” Walton was spotted at this year’s NBA All-Star Game with a smile on his face. Walton is survived by his wife, Lori, and four sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris, all four of whom played college basketball. In addition, Luke Walton played for and coached the Los Angeles Lakers, among other teams, and was an assistant coach for the Cleveland Cavaliers this past season. Adam Walton is also a basketball coach, serving as an assistant for San Diego Mesa College. Submit Δ Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

        "content": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden marked Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation's fallen toward creating a more perfect union, \"for which they lived, and for which they died for.\" Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden said each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country's service members is not in vain. “Freedom has never been guaranteed,” Biden said under gray skies in the memorial amphitheater. “Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” He added: “On this day, we came together again to reflect, to remember, and above all, to recommit to the future they fought for, a future grounded in freedom, democracy, opportunity and equality. Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits, to highlight the importance of honoring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. “Last year, the VA delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever in our history,\" Biden said, crediting the PACT Act which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned, not anymore.” Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans, and Gold Star family members.",

        "content": "If you want to upgrade your bedroom on the cheap, here's an offer that'll grab your attention – all sizes of the Lucid Memory Foam Mattress are 30% off at Lucid Sleep , dropping the price of a queen to as low as $244.99. That's a hefty discount on an already affordable bed. The price alone is enough for anyone to do a double take, but get this: it's available in three firmness levels (plush, medium, and firm) and three heights (10”, 12”, and 14”). It's as customizable as the Saatva Classic, which we consider the best mattress overall – although Lucid offers an additional height option. A couple of things to keep in mind if you decide to explore this Memorial Day mattress sale further. First, the discount doesn't show up automatically – you’ll need to add the mattress to your cart to see the sale price. Also, some size and firmness options are unavailable, as this mattress is (understandably) selling out fast. Lucid Memory Foam Mattress at Lucid Sleep Was: From $249.99 Now: From $174.99 Saving: Up to $132 after in-cart discount Summary: The Lucid Memory Foam Mattress contains a gel memory foam layer, a support foam layer, a bamboo charcoal base foam layer, and a soft, breathable cover. These components work together to align your spine, relieve pressure points, and keep you cool throughout the night. There are three height and firmness levels to choose from, with taller beds costing more. For most adults, we recommend sticking to the 12\" or 14\" heights; the 10\" height is a good choice for a child or smaller adult. We haven't tested this mattress ourselves yet, but Lucid customers like it. It has a 4.5/5 rating with overwhelming praise for its value for money. Price history: If you're looking for an affordable mattress for a guest room or already shopping for a mattress for college , this deal is it. The Lucid Memory Foam Mattress is the brand's cheapest option. The starting price above is for a 10\" twin XL, but we recommend going taller if possible. (A 12\" queen is just $314.99 after discount.) Note that some selections are selling out quickly, namely the 10\" mattresses. Also, you can save more by purchasing multiples, with up to an extra 10% off if you buy three or more mattresses. (Have a vacation home you need to renovate?)

        "description": "HARARE – Bennedict Peters, a prominent Nigerian oil and gas billionaire, once heralded as a [...]",
        "content": "Bennedict Peters, a prominent Nigerian oil and gas billionaire, once heralded as a major investor in Zimbabwe’s mining sector, faces the potential loss of his lucrative mineral concessions due to stalled projects and financial difficulties. Peters, who amassed concessions for platinum, gold, lithium, iron ore, tin, and rare earth minerals with the support of Zimbabwean authorities, initially appeared set to become the first black investor to own significant mining assets in the country. However, his ambitious plans, including a flagship platinum mining project in Ngezi and a highly sought-after lithium dump in Kamativi, have encountered significant hurdles. Despite his initial reputation and promises to invest over US$1 billion in Zimbabwe, Peters’ projects have not progressed as expected. The Kamativi lithium dump, a joint venture with the government, is now at risk of being taken over by the authorities if tangible progress is not made soon. “Authorities are looking into the status of Peters’ projects in Ngezi, Kamativi, and other locations,” a senior Ministry of Mines official said. “There is concern about the slow pace and stalling of these projects. The situation is under scrutiny.” Reports indicate that civil works had started at the Kamativi project, including exploration, surveys, and sampling. However, progress has been slow, leading to government dissatisfaction. Sources reveal that Peters’ financial troubles in Ghana, where his company Aiteo Eastern E&P Company Limited is embroiled in a debt crisis, are affecting his Zimbabwean investments. The Nigerian energy company owes approximately US$2.6 billion in oil-related loans, complicating Peters’ ability to fund his mining projects in Zimbabwe. Peters’ Bravura has a 60% stake in the Kamativi lithium project, but the lack of substantial progress has led officials to consider alternative strategies, including inviting other investors, with Chinese partners being preferred. Government officials have expressed disappointment over the lack of progress, noting that Peters’ promises to invest over US$1 billion into various minerals, including the Kamativi lithium dump, have not been fulfilled. Despite claims of ongoing processes, such as mineralogical and metallurgical testing, visible development remains minimal. In contrast to Peters’ stalled projects, other mining investments in the region, such as Tharisa Plc’s Karo Mining Holdings, are making significant strides. The Karo platinum project, located on Zimbabwe’s Great Dyke belt, is seen as a world-class asset, contributing positively to the local economy and infrastructure. Peters’ inability to advance his projects has led to comparisons with the successful Karo project, further highlighting the issues with his investments. Despite initial enthusiasm and support from President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who launched Peters’ US$1 billion platinum deal, the projects have not met expectations. The Zimbabwean government is now considering repossessing Peters’ concessions and reallocating them to more capable investors. Officials argue that the valuable Kamativi lithium dump, worth billions of dollars, should be managed by investors who can deliver on their promises. Amid these challenges, Peters and his representatives maintain that progress is being made. However, the slow pace and financial instability cast doubt on the future of his Zimbabwean mining ventures. The potential repossession of Peters’ concessions underscores the government’s commitment to ensuring that mining projects contribute meaningfully to Zimbabwe’s Vision 2030 strategy and the broader economic development goals. As the situation unfolds, the focus will be on securing reliable and financially stable partners to harness the country’s rich mineral resources.",

        "description": "Two-time NBA champion and NBA Hall of Famer Bill Walton has passed away following a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA has announced.",
        "content": "NEW YORK -- Two-time NBA champion and NBA Hall of Famer Bill Walton has passed away following a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA announced on Monday. Walton was surrounded by his family, according to the statement. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career - disrupted by chronic foot injuries - lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. \"One of my guards said, 'Let's try something else,\" Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden's response during that timeout: \"Why? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. \"It's very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA's program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. \"As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It's hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.\" The first overall pick of the 1974 NBA draft by the Portland Trail Blazers, the 6-foot-11 Walton played 10 seasons in the NBA, winning championships with the Blazers (1977) and the Boston Celtics (1986). He averaged a double-double over his career, totaling 6,215 points (13.3 per game), 4,923 rebounds (10.5 per game), 1,034 blocks (2.2 per game) and 1,590 assists. A two-time All-Star, he led the NBA in rebounding and blocks in 1977 and was the league's Sixth Man of the Year in 1986. After his NBA career, Walton turned to broadcasting where he entertained generations of basketball fans. Walton originally joined ESPN in 2002 as a lead analyst for NBA games before shifting to college basketball in 2012. He was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all-time by the American Sportscasters Association in 2009.. \"But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life,\" Silver said. \"He was a regular presence at league events - always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" --- Information from the NBA, ESPN and the Associated Press",

        "content": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Georgian Bay, in Ontario, is home to a groundbreaking initiative where researchers are turning ... [+] inhospitable rock barrens into thriving nurseries for endangered turtles, dramatically increasing their chances of survival. In Ontario, there are eight species of turtles, all of which are considered at risk to some degree. These species include the Blanding’s turtle, spotted turtle and snapping turtle, among others. The primary threats to these turtles come from habitat loss and fragmentation, particularly due to urbanization. Turtles are increasingly forced to navigate through hostile environments, crossing roads and developed areas, which often results in high mortality rates. Georgian Bay, often referred to as the sixth Great Lake, offers a stunning vista of the rugged Canadian Shield, hundreds of islands and clear blue waters. This expansive bay is, aside from being a jewel in Ontario’s natural landscape, also one of the last bastions of relative safety for the province’s endangered turtles. Georgian Bay is a stunning expanse of clear waters and rugged islands, serving as both a natural ... [+] fortress and a critical habitat for some of Ontario's at-risk turtles. While that may be the case today, a group of researchers from the University of Waterloo has recognized the critical need for direct intervention in the preservation of turtle populations in Georgian Bay and, by extension, in Ontario. Since 2019, they have been actively developing and testing their innovative habitat designs in the region. Recently, the team has published their findings in the journal Restoration Ecology . Here’s what you need to know. Human Nest Designs Can Significantly Boost Turtle Population Turtles often travel long distances to find suitable nesting sites, which ideally are sandy or soft-soiled areas where they can lay their eggs safely away from water predators but near enough to ensure the hatchlings’ safe passage to water. Apple Brings Back iPhone 14 Pro For First Time At Lower Price Refurbished The Birkenstock Memorial Day Sale Features Styles For Over 50% Off The 82 Best Memorial Day Sales To Shop Now Before They re Gone A tiny guardian of the future, this snapping turtle hatchling rests on the bank of a waterway, no ... [+] bigger than a half-dollar. Mother turtles face the crucial task of wisely choosing their nesting sites—far enough to escape water predators but close enough for hatchlings to safely reach the sanctuary of the water. Recognizing the severe limitations of the rocky terrain in Georgian Bay, researchers have engineered new nesting habitats that imitate the natural conditions turtles seek but rarely find in this landscape. These habitats are crafted from local materials like moss and lichen, known for their ability to retain moisture and provide a stable temperature—key factors for egg incubation. The researchers also carefully selected locations that, in addition to emulating ideal natural conditions, are strategically placed to reduce the need for long, perilous journeys by the turtles. This reduces the risk of road mortality and predation, significantly increasing the chances of survival for both the eggs and the mother turtles. The results from this five-year long initiative speak for themselves. In natural settings around Georgian Bay, where rocky and less hospitable terrains dominate, the probability of turtle eggs successfully hatching has historically been as low as 10%. However, with the introduction of these specially designed habitats, that number has soared to an impressive 41%. There’s More Good News In addition to improving overall hatching rates, the innovative habitats designed by the researchers also play a crucial role in addressing another subtle but significant challenge in turtle conservation: the temperature-dependent sex determination of hatchlings. In many turtle species, the temperature at which eggs are incubated will determine the sex of the turtle; warmer temperatures typically result in female hatchlings, while cooler temperatures tend to produce males. The moss and lichen used in constructing these new habitats have a natural ability to regulate temperature, often creating a warmer microenvironment compared to the surrounding rocky terrain. This slight increase in nest temperature has been shown to skew the sex ratio towards more female hatchlings. In areas like Georgian Bay, where the preservation and propagation of turtle populations are critical, having a higher proportion of females can significantly enhance the recovery and stability of these endangered species. Moreover, the use of such natural materials ensures that the environmental impact of the nesting sites is minimized. These materials are not only abundant in the Canadian Shield but also decompose naturally, leaving no permanent footprint on the landscape. This approach aligns with the principles of ecological conservation, where interventions should enhance, not harm, the existing environment. This pioneering conservation initiative in Georgian Bay demonstrates a successful model that can be replicated in similar rocky terrains across Canada, the United States and beyond. The takeaway is that as our need for urbanization grows, we need to be aware of the damage it causes to other species. Through ingenuity, research and technology, we can enhance habitats for other species, promoting coexistence and harmony with nature. Editorial Standards Print Reprints & Permissions",

        "description": "Pakistan paceman Haris Rauf believes the three months he spent on the sidelines injured with a dislocated shoulder could yet prove a \"blessing in disguise\" as he gears up for the Twenty20 World Cup. The 30-year-old fast bowler made an encouraging return to competitive cricket, taking 2-34, in the second match of Pakistan's warm-up series against T20 world champions England in Birmingham on Saturday.",
        "content": "NEW DELHI: Pakistan speedster Haris Rauf is optimistic that his three-month absence from cricket due to a shoulder dislocation might turn out to be advantageous as he prepares for the upcoming T20 World Cup . In his comeback match, the second game of Pakistan's preparatory series against England, the reigning T20 world champions, in Birmingham on Saturday, the 30-year-old pacer displayed a promising performance, claiming a couple of wickets. \"I was injured the last few months but if you believe in yourself, then the layoff can be a blessing in disguise,\" he told a pre-match press conference in Cardiff on Monday ahead of the third T20. \"Because you have time to recover and reassess your game-plans. I felt good coming back to cricket. When you play for your country, it makes you very proud.\" As for the mental and physical strain of returning from injury for a fast bowler, Rauf said: \"It's hard. It's a struggle during your rehab, and it's difficult when you come back to maintain that pace and accuracy. But if you believe in yourself, it makes things easier. When I wasn't in the team and rehabbing, I had a lot of time to think about my game and work on myself. \"Thankfully I'm back now, and the World Cup is coming up.\" Rauf's return at Edgbaston could not prevent Pakistan suffering a 23-run defeat by England as they fell 1-0 behind in the four-match series with two to play following a washed-out opener. But Rauf insisted Pakistan, the 2009 T20 world champions, remained in optimistic mood ahead of their opening match at this year's global showpiece against co-hosts the United States in Dallas on June 6. \"When you lose a game it hurts, but as a team, we are confident,\" he said. \"We feel we can beat any opposition on any day. We've done it in the past, too. When you make mistakes you learn and try not to repeat those mistakes. We're looking to play better in the next few games and make a comeback. \"The camp is relaxed. We're enjoying ourselves. We're trying to follow our game-plans and execute them well. The results haven't often been in our favour recently but if you stick to your plans they can sometimes follow.\"",

        "description": "Squeaks, an Israeli Persian cat, fully recovered from an infection resistant to antibiotics by veterinarians who used personalized phage therapy.",
        "content": "Antibiotics are still the first line of treatment for infections in , but as these drugs are overused, many bacteria become resistant to them. Now, for the first time, an Israeli Persian cat has undergone personalized bacteriophage therapy that uses its genetic profile to guide decisions made for , diagnosis, and treatment. Bacteriophages (“phages” for short) are natural viruses that can selectively target and kill bacteria. They are considered to have a high therapeutic potential for the treatment of severe bacterial infections, especially those that cannot be treated with antibiotics. The therapy is personalized because the specific phages used are tailored to the individual patient's infection, as determined through bacterial culture and . In 2010, the first report of a veterinary clinical trial of a phage-based infection treatment was published. Ten dogs with chronic ear infections were treated with a cocktail of six phages active against the . The technique has also been used in cows, chickens, and other farm animals. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of general phage therapy in the food industry, largely in the dairy and meat industry, to combat bacterial growth. But this was only a general—not personalized—treatment that did not involve tailoring the phage to the animals’ genetic profile, so it was not very successful. A new study led by Prof. Ronen Hazan and his team from the Faculty of Dental Medicine at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HUJI), in collaboration with the team of Vet Holim – the Veterinary Medical Center in Kiryat Anavim just outside Jerusalem – has achieved a significant advancement in the treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections in animals. Interestingly, unlike common situations, this case was performed on an animal based on doctors’ insights from treating humans first. The team just published their innovative therapy in the journal Veterinary Quarterly under the title “Successful phage-antibiotic therapy of implant-associated infection in a Siamese cat.” The team included Ron Braunstein, Goran Hubanic, Ortal Yerushalmy, Sivan Oren-Alkalay, Amit Rimon, and Shunit Coppenhagen-Glazer. Their treatment involved a five-year-old Siamese cat named Squeaks who suffered from an infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria (that infects humans as well as canines) after undergoing arthrodesis surgery on a damaged joint cartilage to fuse two leg bones together. After the surgery, the area of bone where the joint was positioned is no longer capable of motion, and the pet is relieved of severe pain. Squeaks, initially treated at the Kiryat Anavim veterinary hospital for injuries sustained from a high-rise fall, developed a severe infection in the right hind leg following multiple operations. This infection persisted despite various antibiotic treatments over four months. Facing a potential implant-replacement surgery, the team turned to the new treatment which involved a meticulously designed combination of a specific anti- phage, a virus that kills bacteria, applied topically to the surgical wound, with ceftazidime (an injected, broad-spectrum third-generation cephalosporin beta-lactam antibiotic) administered with a needle into the muscle. After receiving instructions, the cat’s owners gave Squeaks most of the treatment doses of phages and antibiotics at their home. The integration of phage therapy with antibiotics was aimed at targeting the pathogen effectively and directly at the site of infection, leveraging the phage’s ability to be applied topically, which simplifies administration and maximizes its concentration at the infection site. This approach allowed the surgical wound, which had remained open for five months, to fully heal after 14 weeks of treatment. The successful outcome of this case underscores the critical need for novel therapeutics like personalized phage therapy to cope with the growing concern of antibiotic-resistant infections that affect up to 8.5% of surgical sites following orthopedic surgeries in pets. These infections pose significant health risks to the animals and increase the suffering, deaths, and costs involved in these procedures. Recent studies suggest that phage therapy, already showing high success rates in human medicine for treating orthopedic infections and chronically infected wounds, can offer a promising solution for similar issues in veterinary practice. Moreover, the successful treatment of this cat by its owners at home highlights the practicality and efficacy of personalized phage therapy, which could be extended to treat other pets facing similar antimicrobial resistance challenges, the authors wrote. The positive reception from veterinarians and pet owners regarding phage therapy indicates growing awareness and acceptance of this treatment option. “As the new treatment continues to be explored in veterinary settings, it not only improves the health and well-being of pets but also offers valuable data that contribute to the broader application of phage therapy in both animals and humans,” they continued. This bridging of data can enhance treatment protocols and outcomes across various bacterial infections, potentially changing the landscape of infection treatment in both veterinary and human medicine.” Braunstein told that the vet hospital treated Squeaky for free because it was the first case and that the team is ready to accept any pet—even a snake, dog, gerbil, rabbit, or others—for treatment if it suffers from a persistent bacterial infection that is not healing after being treated with antibiotics.",

        "description": "As attacks kill yet more civilians in Rafah, students at their allies at UofT say they will not stop pressuring the university to divest from Israel.The post Ontario Federation of Labour rallies with students at UofT encampment appeared first on rabble.ca.",
        "content": "The leadership of the Ontario Federation of Labour (OFL) held an emergency rally on Monday morning, May 27 on the University of Toronto (UofT) campus. The rally was in solidarity with students and their supporters who for three weeks have set up camp on the university grounds to call for their school’s disclosure of, and divestment from, investments in Israel. UofT president Meric Gertler announced in a statement on Monday that lawyers for the university were seeking an injunction from Ontario Superior Court to have the encampment removed. This comes after the protesters were served with a trespass notice by the Toronto Police Service (TPS) late last week with a deadline to vacate the campus by Monday morning. “In addition to pursuing this legal avenue to return King’s College Circle to the University community, we continue to engage in discussions with students representing those in the encampment,” reads Gertler’s statement. “We held a long and productive meeting yesterday and are meeting again today. We remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement and bring the unauthorized encampment to an end.” Labour rallies in support of students In an open letter to Gertler, OFL President Laura Walton accused him and the university of failing to bargain in good faith with the students involved in this peaceful protest. Walton explained that OFL members have successfully bargained with university administrators in the past and that they should take the same approach with these students. “The same approach should apply here. Negotiations must continue in good faith , and without threats of police intervention. The recent successful conclusions to the encampments at Ontario Tech University and at McMaster University, for example, shows what’s possible,” the OFL letter reads. READ MORE: Students are making history. All of us should join them “Universities should be where we learn to debate and disagree with each other– without the fear of violence . For Canada’s largest university to decide unilaterally when the debate should end, and when police repression should begin, is a betrayal of the values we claim to uphold,” the letter goes on to read. Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) Local 3902, which represents 11,000 educators and researchers at UofT likewise expressed their support for the students and condemned the university for making threats. “Your recent letter to U of T Occupy for Palestine and accompanying offer constitute a serious and deeply concerning escalation of the administration’s negotiating tactics. The CUPE 3902 Executive condemns the administration’s presentation of an offer to student organizers under the threat of forceful removal from their protest encampment,” reads a statement from CUPE 3902’s executive committee. CUPE 3902 executives added that they were prepared to take further action against the university in support of the students. Students holding firm to their demands Students involved in the encampment protest are remaining clear and consistent in their demands to UofT administration. A joint letter sent out on Friday, May 24 by the Association of Part-time Undergraduate Students (APUS), University of Toronto Graduate Students’ Union (UTGSU), University of Toronto Mississauga Students’ Union (UTMSU) and Scarborough Campus Students’ Union (SCSU), and the University of Toronto Students’ Union reaffirmed their demands that UofT administration disclose and divest from all investments in support of Israeli apartheid. “Students have been clear with their demands. The University must divest from all direct and indirect financial investments that sustain Israeli apartheid, occupation and its illegal settlement of Palestine including any manufacturing and sales of military weaponry in the ongoing genocide in Gaza,” the student unions’ letter reads. They are also calling on the university to cut all ties with Israeli academic institutions that support Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory. The unions also condemned Gertler’s threat of police force to silence them. “As a result of the recent announcements made by President Gertler to the students, we fear an escalation of the violence by the institution and police on students similar to other university campuses when their administration moved to dismantle encampments and student organizing and silencing student voices who continue to hold the university administration accountable,” the unions state. The unions also point out that UofT was one of the last Canadian academic institutions to divest itself from supporting apartheid South Africa in the 1980s. “We continue to express our support for the calls of students to the administration to take action and ensure that they divest from all forms of financial investments that sustain Israeli apartheid, occupation and its illegal settlement of Palestine,” the unions’ letter goes on to read.

        "content": "Rafael Nadal's return to the French Open lasted just one match after losing to Alexander Zverev in the first round in straight sets on Monday. Despite the loss and past teases of retirement, Nadal declined to say after the match whether or not this would be his last time playing at Roland Garros: \"I went through all this process with the dream to be back here in Roland Garros. For me it is difficult to say what is going on in the future. It is a big percentage that I will not be back playing here, but I cannot say 100 percent. I enjoy playing here. The body is feeling a little better than two months ago, so...maybe in two months I say 'it's enough,' but this is something I don't feel yet.\" This was a similar answer to what Nadal said prior to the tournament when asked about his future. \"It's a big, big chance that it's going to be my last Roland Garros,\" he said on Saturday. \"But if I have to tell you it's 100% my last Roland Garros? Sorry, but I will not. Because I cannot predict what's going on.\" There are no words. Merci, Rafa 🫶#RolandGarros @RafaelNadal pic.twitter.com/znj0j42Qbf Nadal hasn't committed to playing in Wimbledon, only saying on Monday it \"looks difficult\" for him to make the transition to competing on grass before shifting back to clay for the Olympics. After sitting out most of 2023 due to a hip injury, Nadal returned to action at the Brisbane International in December. He advanced to the quarterfinals before losing to Jordan Thompson. Following that loss, Nadal dropped the first hint that 2024 might be the final year of his career. He did quality it at that point by saying this would \"probably\" be his last season. Monday's loss marks Nadal's first non-injury defeat prior to the fourth round at the French Open. He had to withdraw prior to a third-round match against Marcel Granollers in 2016 due to a wrist injury. Zverev was a bad draw for Nadal to try and get his legs back under him in a grand slam tournament. The German star is currently the No. 4 player in the world and is coming off a semifinal run at the Australian Open in January. This was Nadal's ninth singles match since April. He is 5-4 overall with his best showing being a fourth-round run at the Madrid Open.",

        "description": "Get latest articles and stories on India at LatestLY. Former JNU student leader Umar Khalid has sought regular bail on the grounds of delay and parity with other accused persons.",
        "content": "New Delhi [India], May 27 (ANI): Delhi's Karkardooma court on Tuesday is likely to pronounce an order on the bail plea of Umar Khalid in the larger conspiracy of Delhi riots case of 2020. He has been in custody since September 2020 in a case under UAPA. Former JNU student leader Umar Khalid has sought regular bail on the grounds of delay and parity with other accused persons. Special Judge Sameer Bajpai reserved the order on May 13 after hearing the counsel at length. Delhi police's Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) opposed the plea calling it frivolous and baseless. He also filed written submissions. Umar Khalid's Counsel had argued that no terror case was made out against him and his name was repeated in the charge sheet of Delhi police. Repeating his name doesn't make a lie, a truth. There was a vicious media trial taken against him. He had also filed his written submissions. It is alleged by the Delhi police that Umar Khalid had pre-planned protests in 2020 at 23 sites that culminated in riots. After withdrawing his bail plea from the Supreme Court in February, Khalid moved to trial court seeking bail on the grounds of a change in circumstances and parity with other account-used persons. Senior advocate Tridip Pais questioned the submissions of Delhi police and asked, \"Is sharing messages a criminal or terror act?\" He also responded to submissions earlier made by the Special public prosecutor (SPP) who had said that Khalid was amplifying his narrative as part of a conspiracy by sharing certain links with people with people from politics and others on social media. Pais argued that Umar Khalid was sharing the 'correct narrative.' The senior advocate had also submitted that there was a vicious media trial taking place against Umar Khalid. He also referred to various statements of news anchors from different media channels. He said that anchors were reading from the charge sheet around the clock. He further argued that no terror case is made out against Umar Khalid and police have no material to this effect. The court must see whether a terror case is made against him or not. There are contradictions in the statement of prosecution witnesses, Pais added. In this situation, the court must determine whether the witness statement prima facie makes a terror case against Umar Khalid. Earlier it was argued that there accused persons namely Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and Asif Iqbal Tanha were granted bail by the High Court. They had a similar role to that of Umar Khalid. While opposing the bail application of Umar Khalid, Delhi police had said that his chats revealed that he is in the habit of creating narratives on media and social media to influence bail hearings. It was also submitted by the Special Public Prosecutor that several people took to X (earlier Twitter) to influence bail hearing. He had referred to the post on X by Teesta Seetalvad, Amnesty India, Akar Patel, Raj Kaushik, Swati Chaturvedi, Arju Ahmed and others. Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) while opposing the bail application of Umar Khalid referred to his WhatsApp chats. The SPP had submitted, \"WhatsApp chats also revealed that he is in habit of creating media and social media narratives at the time of listing of bail applications of the person booked in cases to clearly influence bail hearings.\" \"Similar exercise is being adopted while applicants' bails are being listed to influence his bail hearings, samples of post on X (earlier Twitter) with hashtag about applicant annexed herewith,\" SPP added. \"Thus in the light of the aforesaid, the present second application for grant of bail to the accused deserves to be dismissed by this honourable court in the interest of justice,\" SPP Prasad submitted. SPP Amit Prasad also mentioned the Post on Twitter by Teesta Seetalvad, Aakar Patel, Kaushik Raj, Swati Chaturvedi, Arju Ahmed and others. SPP had also read some of the tweets in the court. One of the tweets read \"Ram Raheem''s parole approved, Umar Khalid bail 14 times adjourned in SC. #freeumarkhalid.\" \"Umar Khalid withdraws his bail petition from SC. This is a travesty of Justice,\" another tweet read. SPP submitted that Amnesty India also tweeted which read \"SC has adjourned hearing his bail hearing 14 times. Acute Subversion of the right of Umar Khalid to get bail.\" \"#freeUmarKhalid was used,\" the SPP submitted. The SPP argued that while they claim that they were subjected to media trial, it is he who was playing around with the media, how His father gave interviews in the media and people associated with him also doing the same. In his rebuttal arguments, Senior Advocate Tridip Pais argued that a mere meeting of accused individuals doesn't imply terrorism. \"None of the witnesses didn't say anything but then miraculously said something two weeks later. All the witnesses here seem to be taking tablets for memory. Prima facie requires depth, not frivolously reading out the chargesheet,\" Pais argued. Senior advocate Pais submitted that the prosecution argument is that because I (Umar Khalid) can fain tension. Therefore I don't deserve bail. His father gave an interview therefore he doesn't deserve the bail. While arguing, the senior advocate referred to the Supreme Court judgement in Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali, Shoma Sen and Varnan Gonsalves. \"It was submitted that the allegations should be good enough to establish the allegations are substantive, to reject the bail. The duty of the court is not to deal with the material meticulously but to see the broad probability,\" the senior advocate added. On the point of terrorist activity aspect, it was submitted that there is no evidence to show it is a terrorist activity. There is nothing on record to attract section Section 15 of UAPA. The High Court and the Special Court haven't distinguished between the acts or persons. They've just painted everything with a broad brush. There is not a single witness whose statement attracts 15(1) qua me (Umar Khalid). On the point of meeting Umar Khalid, the defence counsel rejected the prosecution's arguements that meetings were secret ones. He said that Umar Khalid, Tahir Hussain and Khalid Saifi met at the office of PFI has been referred by the Prosecution on the basis of the statement of a witness CDR. \"You want to rely on CDR to deny me bail, Pais questioned. \"As per CDR they were not there at the given time and date,\" he argued. He further argued that there is no credible case of conspiracy, which is also not terror activity. There is no seizure from me that can attract the offence of terror activity. \"On the whimsical statement, sometimes even without witnesses, an act of terrorism is foisted towards me,\" Pais submitted. \"It was also said that Bangladeshi women and children were deployed at the protest sites. Did any women say that it was against me,\" Pais questioned. \"In the Varnan Gonsalves and Shoma Sen case, the views of the Supreme Court on Prima Facie and analysis of Prima facie have been clarified,\" the defence counsel argued. Pais argued that at the time of hearing bail, the court was under a duty to scan the case diary to decide whether the allegations were prima facie true or not. Third-party hearsay can not be attributed to me. \"Mere having a meeting is not enough to oppose the bail. There is no material as of now. The bail cannot be denied as the material can come later,\" Pais argued. \"If ten witnesses state my name, does that make a terror case against me? I have not indulged in a terrorist act. There is not even a seizure from me,\" Pais submitted. (ANI)",

        "content": "With the 90th pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, the selected linebacker DeMarvion Overshown in the third round. His lengthy frame and years of leadership for the Texas Longhorns' defense made him one of the top prospects at the position, and there was expectation he could step into 's defense and contribute right away. Unfortunately, his campaign was cut short after tearing his ACL in the preseason. Now entering his second year, the Texas-native is looking to remain a fit on this defense despite . With an ongoing recovery process and a new system to work into, what can fans expect in the delayed debut from Overshown this season? The primary difference from Dan Quinn's defense is that . Measuring in at 220 pounds when he arrived at camp last season, Overshown's thin, lanky build wasn't the typical prototype for the system. But instead of twiddling his thumbs while in recovery, the 23-year-old has put in work to add weight and reshape his body. Overshown recently spoke about his offseason journey, : I've put about 12-13 pounds of lean mass on, and I'm gonna go into camp a little bigger and then drop down to where I wanna play at, which will be around 233 or 234 [pounds]. The Cowboys currently have nine linebackers on their roster. Eric Kendricks is the most familiar with Zimmer, thanks to their time together with the . Damone Clark also played over 73% of snaps last season for the team. Markquese Bell tallied over 60%, but may not be a scheme fit as a moneybacker more than a traditional linebacker. That leaves one open spot for the base-starting defense. While there are plenty of potential players who could earn the role, the headliners for the final spot are Overshown and Dallas' third-round pick in the , Marist Liufau, out of Notre Dame. Whether he operates in a starting or rotational role, Overshown's added weight, combined with his history of production throughout his collegiate career, points to him being an asset at the second level. Despite dealing with an injury in his first year, the former All-Big 12 star still has time to get going and make an impact in the league. Source:",

        "content": "The Chief Executive Officer of the Fundamental Right to Education Support (FRES) Foundation, Michael Kayode Ojo, has advocated for increased funding for the child’s education. He also called for better government intervention in the area of infrastructure development with a well-equipped library situated in a conducive learning environment. Ojo made the call at an event tagged Children’s Day Event and Award Celebration, held to reward excellence in education on Children’s Day, May 27, in Lagos on Monday. The event had over 100 pupils from ten private schools competing for prizes in indoor games, talk shows, talent hunts, and award presentations. In his remarks, Ojo said, “Today, we are celebrating the children. This is part of the activities with which we celebrate excellence in education among children. It is aimed at encouraging them. This is the third edition. “Prior to this, there was an essay competition where schools, both private and public, from the 57 local government areas in Lagos State participated in an essay competition and were rewarded accordingly. “We have identified poor parenting as one major factor militating against quality education for children. For us, we have been trying to engage parents on how they could intervene in their children’s education. “I want to encourage parents to put more effort into educating these children. Also, for the government, we are in partnership with LASUBEB. We have been engaging them. “I commend the Lagos State government on its giant stride in the education sector. I encourage other states to emulate Lagos State government but there is still more to be done to ensure that children are adequately educated. “We want the government to invest more in terms of infrastructure and funding for education because it is important for schools to have a well-equipped library and a conducive environment for learning. “Many of the private schools around do not have the capacity to do this. This is where the government comes in. They should make sure that education is put on a proper spectrum.” The programme facilitator, Pastor Babatunde Smith, said the event is an education centre award for the children. He said, “It is an investment for the education of the children. He urged parents to open an account to fund the education of the children.” The event co-sponsor, Miss Sarah Akerele of the Treasure Kids Foundation, said the event is also about rewarding parents for excellence in the discharge of parental roles and creating awareness of the educational needs of special children. She added, “The Treasure Kids Foundation is an organisation that is focused on the needs of special children. We are concerned about children with congenital disorders in society. “We do this by creating awareness, providing education, and advocating for the special needs of these children. We are here today to celebrate our children’s special day and to reward them for excellence in learning. Education is a challenge for special needs children due to their peculiar challenges, hence our decision to reward excellence in education. One major challenge is a lack of awareness and proper education for special needs children. Special education is nothing like conventional education. “It is not easy for special children to get an adequate education, and that is the gap we stand to bridge at Treasure Kids.” The highlight of the event is the presentation of cash gifts, certification of participation, and educational materials to participating schools, pupils in both the primary and secondary categories, as well as some deserving parents.

Acuña suffered the injury in the Braves' 8-1 win at the Pittsburgh Pirates on Sunday. After opening the game with a double, Acuña started toward third on a stolen base attempt. His left knee gave way when he stopped in an attempt to return to second base. The Braves announced Sunday night that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery.

        "content": "The CEO of Blackstone, Steve Schwarzman, has said he will back Donald Trump's reelection bid, citing concerns over \"the dramatic rise of antisemitism\" and the \"direction\" of the country. In a statement to Axios, Schwarzman said: \"The dramatic rise of antisemitism has led me to focus on the consequences of upcoming elections with greater urgency.\" \"I share the concern of most Americans that our economic, immigration and foreign policies are taking the country in the wrong direction. For these reasons, I am planning to vote for change and support Donald Trump for President. In addition, I will be supporting Republican Senate candidates and other Republicans up and down the ticket,\" he added. Related stories The endorsement marks a reversal for Schwarzman, the billionaire cofounder of Blackstone, the world's largest alternative asset manager. In November 2022 , the lifelong Republican said he would not support Trump in the 2024 presidential primary, calling instead for \"the Republican Party to turn to a new generation of leaders.\" Schwarzman's endorsement will, therefore, come as a particularly welcome boost for Trump, providing the former president with access to a powerful network of Republican donors. It would also appear to suggest Trump's strategy of accusing Biden of being weak on antisemitism — especially in the wake of pro-Palestinian college protests — has started to pay off. \"If Jewish people are going to vote for Joe Biden, they have to have their head examined,\" Trump said in a video posted to social media earlier this month. If reelected, Trump has said he would he would revoke student visas of \"anti-Semitic foreigners\" and that he would not welcome any Gaza refugees into the US. \"Under the Trump administration, we will revoke the student visas of radical anti-American and anti-Semitic foreigners at our colleges and universities and we will send them straight back home,\" he said at a campaign speech in Iowa last year.",

        "content": "In context: Supply chain attacks are usually conceived to target a specific company by infecting a single element involved in the manufacturing or distribution of a software product. Once the supply chain is compromised, all downstream users and customers of the affected company can be easily targeted as well. Justice AV Solutions (JAVS) provides software products to more than 10,000 courtrooms in the US and around the world. The 35-year-old company was recently affected by a dangerous supply chain attack, in which unknown cybercriminals were able to implant their own backdoor into a supposedly legitimate, official software download. As reported by Rapid7, the supply chain attack compromised the JAVS Viewer 8.3.7 program included in the JAVS Suite 8 product. JAVS Suite is a \"database-centered\" software designed to create, manage, and view digital recordings of \"critical meetings\" in courtrooms and business environments. JAVS describes it as a \"complete AV management\" suite running on Windows 10 or later PC operating systems. As part of the main JAVS Suite, JAVS Viewer allows employees to open and manage previously recorded logs and media files. Version 8.3.7 of JAVS Viewer was found to be infected with a backdoor and was seemingly hosted on JAVS' own servers, Rapid7 confirmed. This means that all customers using that specific version of the software should take serious mitigation measures to avoid unpleasant surprises in the future. The backdoor was digitally signed to avoid triggering initial security warnings, although the signing entity was \"Vanguard Tech Limited\" and not \"Justice AV Solutions Inc.\" as it should have been. Once installed, the compromised JAVS Viewer was designed to connect to remote command-and-control servers and wait for further orders. The malware would then steal sensitive data, including hostname and OS details, browser passwords, and more. The malicious executable (fffmpeg.exe) is known to be part of the GateDoor/Rustdoor malware family and has already been flagged by many security vendors and AV solutions. JAVS officially acknowledged the supply chain attack on its website, stating that the incident (tracked as CVE-2024-4978) was now resolved with a new release of the JAVS Viewer program. According to Rapid7 analysts, the JAVS backdoor incident could have lasting consequences, including compromised systems, stolen passwords, and unauthorized remote access. All users of JAVS Viewer 8.3.7 should completely re-image any endpoint system where the program is used, as simply uninstalling or updating the software alone isn't enough to eradicate the threat. Access credentials and passwords for system accounts and web browsers should be reset as well.",

        "content": "Let me state upfront that I don’t have the inside scoop on Joe Roberts’s whole deal. All I know is that the same man who wrote a syndicated Jewish Telegraphic Agency column in February about fearing he’d have to become a U.S. immigrant-turned-refugee from Canada—which I wrote my own column about in response—who now stands accused of having invented a Jewish identity for himself. I guess it’s time! @Joe_Roberts01 , when you talk about your Jewish grandmother, do you mean grandma Jessie, or grandma Vida? https://t.co/4OtY8l9mjK pic.twitter.com/qOnwQ0Z8Qh — Christi Olson (@christiolson) May 10, 2024 Roberts has pushed back against this publicly, but thus far without addressing the specific claims: I have devoted my life to Jewish tradition and have spent the past twenty years serving the Jewish community in leadership roles.

While they are deeply upsetting, they will not deter me. I am consulting legal counsel and will address them in due course. — Joe Roberts (@Joe_Roberts01) May 13, 2024 This leaves open, among so many other possibilities, that he is Jewish, but was less than forthright about biographical details. Also possible: everything he said was true and people on social media are trying to smear him. Also possible: he’s lied about it all and is going to pop up in the next town a purported lifelong Zoroastrian. Like I said, I don’t know! Now I will readily cop to being a curious so-and-so, who is on some level wondering what the story here turns out to be. I’m not that curious, however. Not enough to become an amateur let alone professional Joe Roberts-ologist. To me, the more interesting angle is the way squabbles over the boundaries of Jewish identity have emerged post-Oct. 7. As we discussed on a recent Bonjour Chai podcast episode, it’s not even straightforward whether there is such a thing as faking being Jewish. I mean there is, in the superficial The Mad Adventures of “Rabbi” Jacob sense, wherein you are a non-Jewish character in a 1970s French farce impersonating a rabbi due to plot twists too convoluted to get into. But there are enough definitions of Jewishness floating around that anyone who in good faith (so to speak) insists they are the thing, is the thing, at least in someone’s book. If you claim to be Indigenous and you’re not, you may get found out . Jewishness is in some sense more like being a member of a sexual minority. Someone might be lying about being bisexual, but what would it even mean to fact-check such a thing? If you’re not attempting to get married by an Orthodox rabbi or to move to Israel under the right of return, and you’re simply going around saying you’re Jewish, who’s to say otherwise? Of course, for all the internal Jewish communal discussions of gatekeeping , of which Jews feel how welcome in which environments, it can be helpful to zoom out and consider whether there is, in fact, a horde trying to get through the gates in question. Outliers aside ( George Santos , Julia Salazar ), there just plain doesn’t seem to be a tremendous interest. Or rather, there wasn’t, until we became the ultimate trending topic. If you’re Jewish, you might find yourself wishing—at least, I find myself wishing—things were just the tiniest bit less about us all the time. But if you’re not, maybe you want to be where the action is at? Maybe you wish the news cycle was all about you? I have no idea. The real question is, what is the political significance of questioning the Jewishness of a prolific pro-Israel poster? If it turns out that the accusations are true and there’s a big-on-X Zionist claiming to be Jewish under false pretenses, why would this be a source of delight for pro-Palestinian activists? After all, most Zionists aren’t Jewish. There are outright Christian Zionists, as well as non-Jews who don’t want Israel wiped off the map. Now some of it is that people are always thrilled to hear that someone with the wrong-in-their-view politics is a fraud. But I think it’s about more than that. Consider, for a moment, the place of Jews in post-Oct. 7 antizionism. There are individual Jews with antizionist beliefs, such people absolutely exist , but their numbers, for complicated reasons, seem greater than they actually are . One reason is that the Jews who want Israel gone tend to be found in places like media and academia and therefore have articles written about them, or write articles themselves. Another is that it is beneficial to pro-Palestinian activists to deflect charges of antisemitism by pointing to the presence of Jews in their movement. That is, if it is still considered important to deflect in this way; frankly it’s heartening if it even is. This is why every protest and rally scene has those big banners attesting to Jews’ opposition to the war, or to more than just the war, i.e. Israel itself. It’s not that no such Jews exist, or that they aren’t real Jews (as if I were interested in gatekeeping this!). It’s that there is an even larger group of people for whom it is useful to be like, look, we don’t hate Jews, we just hate Zionists! Thereby eliding such things as, that virtually all Jews are Zionists of one sort or another; that Zionist and Jew get used interchangeably; and that events where people mobilize against “Zionists” not infrequently include outbursts against Zionists of the non-euphemistic variety, a.k.a. Jews. This is why even in my not particularly Jewish bit of west Toronto, the signage is not just ubiquitously pro-Palestine but with an on-behalf-of-Jews motif. One of the groups listed as behind this window describes itself as “A home for white people working for justice.” I mean some white people are Jewish, and benefit-if-the-doubt the ones behind this display are, but if you’re advocating as white people , maybe pick a different sign, maybe? Although I guess Whites against those nefarious Zionists would have a different ring to it. The fact of the matter is that I have seen more stickers, pins, graffiti, etc., in recent months about how the Jews feel about Israel—negative, per the signage—than... how to put this? Than is plausible given how many Jews there are in these parts, period, let alone antizionist ones. So while you do get people questioning the Jewish authenticity or values or whatever of pro-Palestinian Jews, you also get people like yours truly, who simply doubt that a tiny minority within a tiny minority could possibly be the driving force behind Free Palestine, at the levels the signage and hashtags insist. What a boon, then, for that side to have a No wait, it’s the ZIONISTS who are the fake Jews! moment. After saying for however long (decades in some cases, or since learning about this topic a few months ago in many others) that actual Jewish values dictate opposing Israel in all ways, they see a chance to see-how-the-tables-have-turned suggest that there is some sort of epidemic of people pretending to be Jewish in order to...? all the foaming-at-the-mouth zionists who have taken to the soapbox (anthony koch, richard marceau, joe roberts, deborah lyons) were neither born jewish, nor raised w/ jewish values. why are these genocide enthusiasts speaking on behalf of us? why are they defining antisemitism? https://t.co/n93fuAaPuv — cornchip (@scorn_chip) May 23, 2024 But here is where I’m lost. Jews tend to like having allies. Particularly in times like these. And an ally is by definition not a member of the group in question, nor claiming to be. If there are pro-Israel Jews who took/take comfort in Roberts’s anti-antisemitism, Israel-defending timeline, of course they’d take it as a blow if it turns out he’s not quite who he says. But this isn’t because Jews demand that everyone who fights antisemitism be Jewish. Hardly! It’s that it’s never a good thing when someone on your side is outed as disreputable.

        "description": "She said her unconventional way of loading up the dishwasher means she doesn't have to keeping bending down to put the dishes inside",
        "content": "Stacey Solomon fans have been left stunned after the mum-of-five revealed another 'genius' trick that helps her get her chaotic house in order quickly. The reality TV star and host of Sort Your Life Out shared how she spent her Sunday evening cleaning up her home after having a lazy day and letting it go 'to ruin'. Surveying the mess at Pickle Cottage, which she shares with husband Joe Swash and the children, Stacey posted a video on Instagram and told her followers: \"I really did what I said I was gonna to do today and just did nothing.\" READ MORE: Gogglebox star Izzi Warner shares emotional solo trip with kids to Disneyland She added: \"I had a little nap and everything. The house has gone to ruin but it's okay - it's Sunday and I was tried. I am gonna give it a good clean now.\" Stacey then posted another video to her Story - a montage of her getting her house in order sound tracked to Daniel Bedingfield's 2001 hit Gotta Get Thru This. She could be seen washing dishes, loading up the dishwasher, wiping down her kitchen and mopping the floor as she tidied away the mess. But her fans were left distracted by one particular detail in the video - the unusual but 'genius' way she loaded up her dishwasher. Instead of bending down to put her dirty dishes inside the machine, Stacey lifted the trays out placing them on her kitchen island and then stacked them full of plates and bowls before returning them to the machine. The video showed Stacey stacking up the dishwasher trays while they were on top of her kitchen island (Image: Stacey Solomon / Instagram) Stacey was inundated with messages about the dishwasher hack and addressed her followers in another video explaining why she does it. She also posted photos of some of the messages she received, with one saying: \"I have literally never thought of taking the racks out of the dishwasher to load them up, genius\" and another commenting: \"Omg stacey why have I never thought to take the dishwasher trays to the mess.\" She told her followers: \"So many of you are messaging me the same thing. Do you know what right, as I get older, I get lazier and I try and find more and more ways of having to do less and make less effort. I just think why bend down.\" At that moment she was interrupted by husband Joe, who walked into the shot holding two fluffy ducklings - the latest additions to their already large family. As Joe smiled at the camera in the background, Stacey carried on with her explanation, saying: \"Why bend down to put things in the dishwasher when you can just whip the trays out and stack them on the side.\" Stacey explained why she took the trays out of her dishwasher in another video - but was interrupted by husband Joe (Image: Stacey Solomon / Instagram) Joe then told her he was taking 'the chicks' to bed and Stacey wound up her video so she could help him. The two ducklings were welcomed to their home last week and they've already proved to be popular with fans of the family. Stacey, 34, and Joe, 42, share three young children - Rex, four, Rose, two, and one-year-old Belle. Stacey also has a 15-year-old son named Zachary and a 12-year-old son named Leighton, who she shares with former partners, while Joe is also dad to his teenage son Harry. They also have two beloved pet dogs - Teddy and Peanut - who help keep the family's Essex home full and busy. And now it's even busier with the arrival of two new pets. Taking to Instagram, Stacey shared a video of them as they settled into their home. The video included clips of Rex and Rose enjoying cuddles with the new additions while the mum herself was also seen tending to the new duo. First sharing a message to her Instagram Story, she wrote: \"We've always felt so privileged to have our garden... And we've always said if the chance ever presented itself and it was right and we had what they needed, we'd love to make it home for little feathered friends [face holding back tears emoji]. So...\" She then pointed fans in the direction of her main Instagram post with the caption reading: \"Welcome To Pickle Cottage. Little Ones. We are so excited to love you & we hope you love living here & being a part of our crazy family. We have no idea what to call our new babies yet, so any suggestions welcome.\"",

        "description": "Chief of Staff Nicolás Posse could be asked to step down following debate over the Ley de Bases in Congress La entrada Milei eyes cabinet reshuffle: who could stay and who could go se publicó primero en Buenos Aires Herald.",
        "content": "While the process has taken longer than the government might have hoped, the congressional debate over the flagship reform bill known as Ley Bases is a clear victory for the Milei administration. Yet as the self-described anarcho-capitalist inches closer to realizing his legislative agenda, his cabinet could be in flux, with Chief of Staff Nicolás Posse on the chopping block. “Our first government milestone would be the outcome of the Ley Bases. It could go well, or it may not be approved,” Milei told LN+ news channel last Thursday. “After that milestone is reached, we will have to evaluate the results , and the entire cabinet will be under analysis. Not just Posse, but all of the ministers.” After being approved in the Lower House in late April, the proposal, also known as Omnibus Bill, is now being discussed by senators in commissions. Lawmakers are expected to approve a final version of the bill in the coming days and hold a session to debate and vote on its contents next week. A potential government turnover could take place after that, and, if approved, Milei’s “May Pact” would become the law of the land as early as June. “We will evaluate what worked, and what didn’t work will be changed,” Milei said. Rumors of Posse’s potential departure have been increasing in recent days. After skipping several government events last month, he attended a religious service held each year on May 25 at the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral with the president and other ministers. Posse also appeared at Milei’s rally in Córdoba later that day, despite speculation that he would not show. Still, Milei’s rift with Posse was evident: during both events, the president declined to shake his chief of staff’s hand. The Córdoba rally presenter also failed to mention Posse by name while listing all of the cabinet members in attendance. The president praised several ministers during his speech, but not Posse’s. Since Milei assumed power in December, Posse has been one of the few members in his inner circle, along with his sister, Presidency Secretary Karina Milei, and his main political advisor, Santiago Caputo. Presidential spokesman Manuel Adorni denied that Posse would be leaving the cabinet during a press conference last week. “That is clearly not true,” he said. “There will not be any changes in the government.” A new stage of government During the same interview in which he pointed to future cabinet changes, Milei mentioned that former Central Bank President Federico Sturzenegger will become a minister if the Ley Bases is approved in the Senate. The legislation’s passage would be the start of the second stage of his “structural reforms,” he said. Sturzenegger has worked closely with Milei since he took office, despite not having an official role in the government initially. In January, he was named head of the “Transitory Unit for Economic Deregulation.” Along with the Omnibus Bill, he co-authored Milei’s massive presidential decree that deregulated the Argentine economy. Despite claiming that Sturzenegger will join the cabinet in an official capacity, current Economy Minister Luis “Toto” Caputo doesn’t appear to be in any danger of being removed. During his speech on Saturday, Milei mentioned him several times, saying Caputo was in charge of “the largest austerity plan in history.” Two weeks ago, Milei also congratulated Caputo on the nation’s 8.8% April inflation rate , gloating that he had scored a “goal.” “I’m going to start calling Toto ‘piggybank,’ because you need to break him into pieces to get a penny out of him,” he had said the day before during an event with business people. “He is unbreakable, and if you want to break him, you’ll have to break me first.” Human Capital Minister Sandra Pettovello’s job also appears to be safe. “Was I wrong when I said Pettovello is harder than a statue’s curl?” Milei asked during an interview with LN+ on May 18, lauding her “unmasking” of Peronism for reporting alleged irregularities in the previous government’s ministry of social development. “I am her friend,” he said. “I know she won’t back down.” Interior Minister Guillermo Francos has been tasked with drumming up support from governors and lawmakers for the Ley Bases since February. In April, Milei said Francos is one of his government’s “doves,” as it’s his role to negotiate with provincial officials and the opposition. The president included Foreign Minister Diana Mondino, Vice President Victoria Villarruel, and Lower House President Martín Menem in that group as well. While he didn’t say who the “hawks” were, Milei joked during an interview with El Observador that he and Security Minister Patricia Bullrich are the “talibans” of the government. “Talibans put the votes on the table,” he told the newspaper. “That’s Patricia and me. Patricia is fabulous, wonderful, amazing. I am fascinated.” Bullrich ran against Milei for the presidency last year. On the campaign trail, Milei referred to her as a “terrorist” for her political activism during the 1970s, but later made amends, leading to her endorsement of him for president ahead of the November runoff election. Last Friday, Francos told Rivadavia radio station that he accepts that he may have fulfilled his duties as interior minister and “may not be needed in the next [stage of government].” “I will remain in my position as long as Milei tells me to,” he added. Despite the rumors and public statements, there are no certainties regarding how or when the cabinet reshuffle will be carried out, only that it will potentially happen after the Ley Bases is debated.",

        "description": "The Israeli prime minister has so far proven resilient to all kinds of setbacks, but now faces huge challenges Read Full Article at RT.com",
        "content": "In recent weeks, many events have unfolded that could seriously disrupt the plans of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. However, his political career shows that he has repeatedly emerged from similar challenges, while only strengthening his position. The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Karim Khan, has asked the ICC to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu along with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and three leaders of the Palestinian group Hamas. Khan believes that they are all potentially guilty of war crimes committed during the Hamas attack on Israel and the subsequent Israeli military operation in Gaza. Adding to Netanyahu’s troubles, on May 28, three European countries – Spain, Ireland, and Norway – will recognize the State of Palestine, with Slovenia and Belgium potentially joining them later. Western countries are beginning to shift away from their unwavering support for Israel. Last December, several Global South countries, including South Africa, also took a stand. South Africa filed a complaint with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Israel, accusing it of genocide in Gaza. As we can see, many storm clouds have gathered over the Israeli authorities, but let’s try to understand where this might lead. Khan stated that there are reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Gallant are responsible for using starvation as a method of warfare, attacking civilians, and depriving them of essential resources such as food, water, and medical supplies. The accusations have sparked strong criticism from Israel and its allies, including the US. President Joe Biden called the ICC’s decision “outrageous” . Israeli and American officials claimed that the ICC warrants undermine international law and moral principles by equating the actions of a democratically elected government with those of a terrorist organization. Israel and the US, neither of which are ICC members, are considering sanctions against the court and its leadership. Netanyahu responded by saying, “Mr. Khan is creating a dangerous precedent that undermines the right of any democracy to defend itself from terrorist organizations and aggressors.” His office later described the ICC’s decision as a “blood libel” and a “crossing of the red line.” Israeli President Isaac Herzog called on the international community to condemn the prosecutor’s decision, noting that the court’s jurisdiction is recognized only by the 124 countries that have ratified the Rome Statute. Several countries – including the US, Israel, China, Iran, India, and Russia – do not recognize the ICC’s jurisdiction. Despite the lack of support for the ICC’s move from Israel’s major allies – the US, UK, France, and other Western countries – media coverage has been largely negative for the Israeli authorities. While Israel does not recognize the ICC’s jurisdiction, Palestine, as a permanent observer at the UN, does, allowing the court to begin its investigation. In response to threats and pressure from Israel and the US, the ICC warned that such attempts could be seen as interference in the administration of justice and contrary to the principles of the Rome Statute. Amid these events, a controversy with Berlin emerged. German law enforcement agencies are obliged to comply with ICC directives if an arrest warrant is issued by the chief prosecutor, as stated by government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit. “We adhere to the law,” Hebestreit said, according to Spiegel. Thus, even though no ICC arrest warrant for Netanyahu has been issued yet, the situation has already caused significant international resonance, increasing tension in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and threatening to complicate diplomatic efforts to resolve the situation. Even if an arrest warrant is issued, it is unlikely that Netanyahu will be arrested and handed over to the ICC. However, it is clear that the situation negatively impacts the reputation of the current leaders of the Jewish state. As detailed previously , the relationship between Joe Biden’s administration and the Netanyahu government is a complicated one, and misunderstandings are only likely to deepen as IDF operations in Gaza continue. With the onset of military action in the southern part of Gaza, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin confirmed Washington’s decision to delay the transfer of a batch of ammunition to Israel due to the situation around Rafah. “We have made it very clear that Israel cannot launch a large-scale attack on Rafah without considering the civilians caught in the theater of operations and without protecting them. We assessed the situation and paused the delivery of a batch of powerful ammunition,” The Times of Israel quoted him as saying during a Senate hearing. Bloomberg, citing sources, noted that this batch included 3,500 bombs. Meanwhile, the US remains Israel’s largest arms supplier, with nearly 70% of Israel’s arms imports between 2014 and 2018 coming from the US, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Therefore, restrictions on arms supplies could complicate the situation for the Israeli armed forces and even create new threats in the short term. Many experts believe that Washington is playing a “double game.” On the one hand, it declares support for Israel, threatens the ICC, and does not exert direct pressure on the Israeli government. But on the other, it limits arms supplies, actively interacts with Israeli War Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz (Netanyahu’s main internal political rival), stirs negative rhetoric around Bibi through the media, and sometimes even covertly influences international organizations and NGOs to pressure the Israeli prime minister and his entourage. Relations are also strained with other Western allies. On May 28, three European countries are expected to recognize Palestine. The leaders of Ireland, Norway, and Spain announced their intention at a time of mass pro-Palestinian rallies, with protesters calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. One might ask: why these three countries? Firstly, such a decision is motivated by the authorities’ desire to reassure their citizens and demonstrate that their voices matter. Secondly, they joined a number of their European partners who previously recognized Palestine (Bulgaria, Hungary, Cyprus, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Sweden), with Belgium and Slovenia expected to follow soon. Thirdly, the European Parliament elections will be held from June 6 to 9, and recognizing Palestine could garner additional votes for allies of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. So, this is a good PR move for the initiators. It will not significantly impact the conflict, since 146 UN member states have officially recognized Palestine in previous decades. However, it is another signal to the Israeli authorities, with the West led by Washington trying to pressure them. It is becoming increasingly clear that Prime Minister Netanyahu has become inconvenient and uncontrollable for them. Bibi feels growing pressure and has already recalled his ambassadors from three countries for consultations. Recently, a video was published in Israel showing Palestinian militant groups capturing and taking mutilated Israeli women to Gaza. Why publish this now? Largely to quell anti-government sentiment among the citizens, who fill the squares in major Israeli cities on Saturday evenings, expressing dissatisfaction with the Netanyahu far-right cabinet’s actions. It also sends a message to the international community, showing the brutality of Israel’s adversaries in Gaza. Additionally, there is a new decision by the International Court of Justice on a case filed by South Africa, joined by Türkiye, Egypt, and several other countries. The ICJ in The Hague ruled that Israel must immediately cease its military operation in Rafah. “The Court considers that, under the Genocide Convention, Israel must immediately cease its military offensive and any other actions in the Rafah governorate that may create living conditions for Palestinians in Gaza leading to their partial or total physical destruction,” said the court president, Nawaf Salam. This call was supported by 13 of the 15 judges. The court also ruled that Israel must preserve all evidence of the alleged genocide and provide unrestricted access to Gaza for investigation commissions, fact-finding missions, or any other bodies authorized by the UN to probe genocide claims. The panel of judges also demanded that Israel open the Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt for humanitarian aid deliveries. Salam added that Israel must report to the court within a month on the implementation of the verdict. It has been almost eight months since latest major escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict erupted. Internally, no significant changes have occurred around the conflict; there are only numerous casualties on both sides. However, this time the situation seems different concerning external positions. The Palestinian resistance has successfully garnered international support, initially from crowds in the streets and now from official representatives. It is premature to speak about the full recognition of a Palestinian state as a bona fide UN member, as countries like the US and UK block the UN General Assembly’s recognition of Palestine, citing the necessity of a peace agreement between Palestinians and Israelis before such a step can be taken. Within societies themselves, the situation is also complex. Attempts to resolve the conflict based on the “two states for two peoples” formula moved the peace process forward in 1993 with the Oslo Accords. These agreements included the recognition of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and the implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The issue of borders remained contentious, even when considering the pre-1967 lines. The initial euphoria and belief that peace was imminent did not last long. On November 4, 1995, Yigal Amir, a student and Jewish extremist, assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, citing his desire to “protect the people of Israel from the Oslo Accords.” There were also many opponents among Palestinians, some of whom openly criticized PLO leader Yasser Arafat’s actions. After Arafat’s death in 2004, shrouded in mystery (many believe he was poisoned), the normalization process stalled. Netanyahu understands all this better than anyone. He undoubtedly sees and comprehends the actions of Western allies. Bibi has always pursued his policies, relying solely on himself and his closest associates. Therefore, these “political games” are likely to continue. Years of conflict have formed radicals on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides. Thus, a resolution will likely require a comprehensive approach and a consensus among leading world powers and the elites of both sides. Unfortunately, it seems that the Israeli-Palestinian question, like the broader Middle East region, may need to undergo a catharsis through destructive warfare, after which a new socio-political landscape and security architecture can begin to take shape.",

        "content": "United Nations: World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday referred to the Global Traditional Medicine Centre set up in India and the first global summit on traditional medicine hosted by the country as he underlined that the year 2023 was a productive one in the UN health agency’s work supporting access to medicines and other health products. “We also established the Global Traditional Medicine Centre in India, and hosted the first global summit on traditional medicine,” Ghebreyesus said in his remarks as he presented his report to the 77th World Health Assembly in Geneva. In March 2022, the Government of India and the UN health agency had signed an agreement to establish the WHO Global Centre for Traditional Medicine. This global knowledge centre for traditional medicine, supported by an investment of USD 250 million from India, aims to harness the potential of traditional medicine from across the world through modern science and technology to improve the health of people and the planet, the UN health agency had said in a press release at the time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said the agreement between the Ministry of Ayush and WHO to establish the Global Centre for Traditional Medicine (GCTM) – world’s first – at Jamnagar, Gujarat, is a commendable initiative. He laid the foundation stone of WHO-GCTM in Jamnagar in April 2022. Speaking on the occasion, Modi had said that the WHO-GCTM is recognition of India’s contribution and potential in this field. “India’s traditional medicine system is not limited only to treatment. It is a holistic science of life. India takes this partnership as a huge responsibility for serving the entire humanity.” WHO had convened the Traditional Medicine Global Summit in August last year in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. The summit was co-hosted by India, which held the G20 presidency in 2023. It was held alongside the G20 Health Ministerial meeting. The summit explored the role of traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine in addressing pressing health challenges and driving progress in global health and sustainable development. Ghebreyesus had arrived in Gujarat to attend the global summit on traditional medicine and was accorded a warm welcome. Praising India for its “rich history” of traditional medicine like Ayurveda and yoga, Ghebreyesus had stressed the need to integrate this ancient medicinal knowledge into the national health system of countries. “India has a rich history of traditional medicine through Ayurveda, including yoga, which has been shown to be effective in alleviating pain. The Gujarat Declaration, the main outcome of this summit, will focus on integration of traditional medicines in national health systems, and help unlock the power of traditional medicine through science,” the WHO chief had said. In his address to the World Health Assembly Monday, Ghebreyesus said 2023 was a year of many challenges, but also of many achievements. He said the year 2023 was a productive one in WHO’s work supporting access to medicines and other health products. “We prequalified 120 medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and other products last year for HIV, malaria, multidrug-resistant TB, Ebola, polio and COVID-19, as well as the first long-acting insulin analogues,” he said. He noted that one of the biggest disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was to routine immunization programmes in many countries, resulting in backsliding coverage and outbreaks of measles, diphtheria, polio, yellow fever and more. “In April last year, we launched ‘The Big Catch Up’ with UNICEF and Gavi, to support countries to shut down outbreaks and restore immunization programmes at least to pre-pandemic levels,” he said. In May last year, the WHO chief had declared an end to both COVID-19 and mpox as global health emergencies. “We continue to call on all countries to maintain and reinforce the capacities for surveillance, detection and response that they built during the pandemic. These investments must not go to waste.”",

PHOTO: PETER MCINTOSH Dunedin police were warned a rising tide of violence among the city’s teenagers could end in a death only an hour before a fatal stabbing at the bus hub.",
        "content": "Police are ensuring they are more visible at the Dunedin bus hub following the death of Enere Mclaren-Taana last Thursday. PHOTO: PETER MCINTOSH It comes as Dunedin Mayor Jules Radich yesterday announced the formation of a multi-agency working group dedicated to changing the culture at the central city hub. The father of a Dunedin teenager, whose son was assaulted at secondary school about a month ago, told the Otago Daily Times his wife called police at 2pm on Thursday last week to check on the status of the investigation into their son’s assault. The police responded by saying they had been too busy to investigate her son’s assault and she replied by saying \"someone is going to die if you guys don’t start taking this stuff seriously\". A little over an hour later Trinity Catholic College pupil Enere Mclaren-Taana, 16, was stabbed to death. The teenager’s father said police had now carried out an interview with the boy who they believe assaulted their son. \"But it took a death before they actually got around to doing anything. \"That’s what’s annoying me, they’re saying they got there within a minute, but they’ve had so many warnings.\" He said the teenager who assaulted their son led a crew of followers, who he called his \"soldiers\", who had been intimidating other teenagers around the city, including at the bus hub. They had complained about their son’s assault, including providing a voice recording of another teenager threatening to slit his throat, to police about a month ago and had got nowhere. Their son was scared to go back to school and has not been back to the bus hub since. \"He’s been wanting to carry a knife and I said ‘no, you can’t do that’.\" When he found out Enere had died, he felt terrible. \"It was almost like we were almost responsible for it. \"We were just trying to warn them because it was getting out of hand.\" The father said another parent who had stopped a fight in the bus hub and was trying to make a complaint had also been \"brushed aside\" by police in the past. \"I think they thought it’s just normal teenage stuff.\" The father felt security at the bus hub was ineffective and called for police presence between 3pm and 5pm on weekdays. A police spokesman said there would be more of a police presence from 3pm to 5pm at the bus hub. He said the safety of the community was not solely a police issue, and they worked closely with different agencies to ensure everyone in the community was safe. \"That important work continues.\" Trinity Catholic College year 12 pupil Enere Mclaren-Taana’s school ID photo from this year. PHOTO: SUPPLIED Logan Park High School principal Peter Hills said pupils, parents and the wider community had all expressed concern about the bus hub as a gathering point. \"There is a desire from all the groups I have mentioned for students to be picked up from schools and taken home rather than a central location, but we can’t control the funding or the bus schedule. \"I imagine that will be a subject of conversation for all schools, and the regional council and the city council, and all the people interested in it.\" In a statement yesterday, Mr Radich said he and representatives from the Dunedin City Council, Otago Regional Council and police met yesterday morning and agreed on a new group. \"While our focus as a city needs to remain on supporting Enere’s whānau as they prepare to farewell their loved one, we also need to do what we can to ensure this sort of tragedy isn’t repeated,\" Mr Radich said. The terms of reference were being drafted and would seek to ensure schools, bus users, and the wider community were all represented. The group would aim to develop short-, medium- and long-term options that could be implemented to improve the culture at the bus hub, and it would meet regularly. \"Last week’s terrible tragedy has sent shockwaves through our community, and we all need to come together to address the issues.\" Otago Regional Council chairwoman Gretchen Robertson said public safety at the hub was a priority for all parties. \"This new group is exactly what we need to be doing — working together to tackle the safety issues there.\" In the meantime there would be an increased security presence at the bus hub alongside a beefed-up police presence, and Bus Stop B would remain closed as a mark of respect. \"We are aware of issues at the hub and are working hard to support people with added security and presence.\" Police Otago Coastal Area Commander Inspector Marty Gray said police wanted to work with all parties to improve safety. \"We’re looking forward to having an active role in the group and helping ensure everyone can use the bus hub with confidence.\" Meanwhile, Ministry of Education Te Tai Runanga (south) leader Nancy Bell said it was in contact with 12 schools last week, as the impact of a traumatic event such as this could be far-reaching. The ministry’s traumatic incidents teams could work alongside schools to support them in managing the incident safely — which included understanding the emotional and psychological impacts and the effects on how people behaved. The ministry was providing some resources to Trinity Catholic College to increase pastoral support for pupils this week.",

The rocket carrying its satellite, Malligyong-1, exploded during the first-stage flight Monday night after launching from the Sohae launching station on its west coast, reported the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).

        "content": "The building, at the major new Top Wighay development on the /Linby border, will replace the ageing in by early 2025, potentially saving £1.5m each year in running costs. Construction began in January, but was delayed by one of the wettest springs on record. Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with an ad-lite subscription to Mansfield and Ashfield Chad, you get 70% fewer ads while viewing the news that matters to you. The building’s skeleton has now been put up, and the council is hoping it will officially be opened by March 2025. Coun Keith Girling (Con), cabinet member for economic development and asset management, said he was pleased with the progress as he visited the site on May 24. He said: “It is going well. \"I am always trying to push things forward – perhaps unrealistically – but the end date is on schedule despite bad weather at the start of the year. “County Hall is a beautiful old building, but it’s costing us £1.7m a year to run, and that’s £1.7m that can be put into services. \"The running cost here will be a lot less. Advertisement Advertisement “All the decisions made will be made in the middle of the county, and social services will be delivered from here, with Mansfield, Ashfield and Hucknall just up the road.” Luke Melville, assistant site manager, said: “It’s been challenging when there’s a lot of water on the ground and heavy machinery moving about. “It should run smoother now work on the superstructure has started.” Plans for the wider 86-acre site at Top Wighay include nearly 800 homes, a primary school, a shopping centre and 21 acres for businesses and offices. Advertisement Advertisement The current County Hall costs £1.7m to maintain each year, in addition to £30m expected essential maintenance over the next 12 years and £28m to bring it up to modern environmental standards. Coun Girling said the public engagement over what to do with the building once the council had left produced ‘some really interesting decisions, from a women’s prison to rooms for the homeless to luxury hotels’. The council will now speak to interested developers on their visions for the site. The new council building is being designed, project and cost-managed by Arc Partnership, and delivered through their construction partner, Morgan Sindall Construction.",

        "content": "Paris: Sumit Nagal's late resistance was not enough as his French Open debut ended with a defeat against big-hitting Russian Karen Khachanov, who overpowered the Indian in straight sets, here on Monday. The top Indian singles player, ranked 95, struggled to match the power and range of his fancied rival, losing 2-6 0-6 6-7(5) in the opening round. Nagal had shocked world number 31 Alexander Bublik at the Australian Open but could not repeat his braveheart act on red clay. The rain before the match had made the court a bit slower and more suitable for longer rallies. It was a fiery start from the Indian but the Russian had the first break of the match when he broke Nagal in game three. Nagal, though, did well to come back from 0-40 to save three breakpoints. However, looking for a wide forehand, he made an unforced error to hand his rival the first break of the match. Rain interrupted the match and resumed after a 21 minute-break. The Russian came out firing on all cylinders as Nagal found it difficult to match the power of Khachanov. It was effortless hitting from the Russian, which Nagal failed to counter. Nagal had little time to react to the shots as the Russian made him run on both flanks. It was difficult to control or create points. He was up 30-0 in game seven but Khachanov reeled off four points in a row to get his second break of the opening set, which he served out in the next game with an inside-out forehand winner, albeit after saving a break chance. He needed solid start to the second set but Nagal dropped his serve in the very first game to go on backfoot. He had two break chances to level the set but Khachanov saved both and broke his rival again for a comfortable 3-0 cushion. Soon it became 5-0 and eventually Khachanov bageled Nagal. From thereon, it was a herculean task for the Indian to make a comeback. He fought his heart out in the third set, stretching it to a tie-breaker but the Russian's experience helped him end Nagal's fight. Rohan Bopanna and Yuki Bhambri will compete in the men's doubles along with their respective partners.",

        "description": "\"Just imagine what I’ve been through behind closed doors,\" Cartwright shared via social media one day after Taylor had a three-hour date with the OnlyFans creator.",
        "content": "Brittany Cartwright is hinting that deeper marital issues at home contributed to her split from estranged husband Jax Taylor — after the latter was seen stepping out with model Paige Woolen. Cartwright, 35, took to her Instagram Story on Sunday to share a Reel posted by @YouKnowNat , in which the influencer’s friend lambasts Taylor, 44, for the way he treats his spouse on their Bravo reality show “The Valley.” “Thank you, & just imagine what I’ve been through behind closed doors,” Cartwright wrote alongside the clip. The individual in the clip was particularly perturbed by Taylor railing into Cartwright for being sick during a cast trip to Big Bear, Calif., on last week’s episode of the unscripted series. The Jax’s Studio City owner blamed her nausea on excessive drinking — and implied that she had a longstanding problem with alcohol — though several of her castmates verified that she hadn’t imbibed prior to vomiting. “Like, this is his show that’s supposed to be about his bar and his community and his friends and he brought his family onto this show and this is what he’s doing to her? Like, he’s choosing to present her in that kind of light and to treat her like that,” the person said in the video. “This is what he’s doing to her in front of everybody.” Cartwright eventually snapped at Taylor, chastising him for verbally attacking her in front of the group, but the duo made up the next day.

Want more celebrity and pop culture news? The person in the @YouKnowNat Reel theorized that Taylor brought Cartwright onto the show knowing their relationship would soon end. “To put her on this show and treat her like this, he knew he was going to leave her, he knew it was over and he knew it would be good TV and that he wouldn’t get punished by the people around him, aka producers, at all,” she said. “If it’s good TV, it flies. What a terrible position for her to be in. Of course she’s not feeling good.” Meanwhile, the person in the clip surmised that Cartwright’s bouts of illness stem from the stress of her relationship with Taylor. “I think she’s sick all the time because she’s treated so terribly and she’s in a bad relationship and that she knows there’s nothing she can do to make it any better,” she said. Cartwright’s co-sign of the message comes as a romance seems to be brewing between the “Vanderpump Rules” OG and OnlyFans creator Woolen, 32. The pair were seen grabbing lunch at Granville Cafe in Los Angeles on Saturday, where they spent three hours together. For more Page Six reality TV updates... Cartwright and Taylor — who share 2-year-old son, Cruz — announced their separation in February after five years of marriage. The mom of one — who isn’t known to be dating anyone at the moment — revealed during an April appearance on “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen” that a “horrible fight” prompted her to call it quits with Taylor. “It was like a veil was lifted, and I noticed everything wrong,” she said. “They always say a woman can hit her breaking point, and it’s hard to come back from that.” One month prior, Cartwright exclusively told Page Six that Taylor’s lack of interest in sex didn’t help matters. “We’ve been together nine years, and people stop appreciating and take you for granted after some time — and that should never happen in a marriage,” she explained at the time. “The Valley” airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.",

        "content": "Vladimir Putin-led Russian government will remove the Taliban from a list of banned terrorist organisations, according to the state-run news agency . The development came three years after the Taliban returned to power in war-torn Afghanistan. Since 2003, the Taliban group has been designated as a terrorist outfit in Russia. “Kazakhstan has recently taken the decision, which we are also going to take, to remove them from the list of terrorist organisations,\" quoted Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as saying on Monday. At the end of 2023, Kazakhstan had removed the Taliban from its list of banned organisations. Despite international sanctions on the Taliban, Russia has fostered its ties with the government run by the banned outfit in Afghanistan. Moscow had also held multiple rounds of talks and boosted trade with Kabul. But, Russia has not recognised Afghanistan’s Taliban government officially yet. The state news agency citing Zamir Kabulov - director of the Second Asia Department at the Russian foreign ministry, reported that Russia’s foreign and justice ministries have reported to President Putin on the issue of removing the ban on the Taliban. The latest move by Russia could further boost diplomacy between Moscow and Kabul. According to , Lavrov said Russia's decision was about recognising the realities on the ground. “They are the real power. We are not indifferent to Afghanistan. And above all, our allies in Central Asia are not indifferent,\" he added. Moscow has also invited Taliban representatives to its flagship Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum, once seen as the cornerstone of Russia’s economic relations with the West, said state media. Russia’s economic event will be held on June 5-8. Kabulov also said that Afghan leaders were traditionally interested in buying oil products, as per . In 2021, after United States-led forces withdrew after 20 years of war, the Taliban had seized power in Afghanistan.

        "content": "The Federal Government has asked members of the National Assembly to subject the Nigerian National Anthem Bill to wider consultations before passing it. The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi, stated this in Abuja on Monday at a public hearing on the bill to revert to the old national anthem. Recall that the House of Representatives accelerated and passed the bill in a single sitting last Thursday, while the Senate passed the bill through first and second readings. Speaking at the hearing jointly organised by the Senate Committees on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters and Interior, Fagbemi said the lawmakers failed to get the opinions of other stakeholders before passing the bill. He said there was a need for a wider process where Nigerians and other arms and tiers of government would participate in the decision to revert to the old national anthem before it finally becomes law. Fagbemi specifically proposed consultations through zonal public hearings and resolutions of the Federal Executive Council, Council of State, National and State Assemblies, etc. He said: “ Consequently, it is my considered view that the decision to change Nigeria’s National Anthem, whether by replacing it with the old one or a new one, should be subjected to a wider process of citizen participation through zonal public hearings, resolutions of the Federal Executive Council, Council of State, National and State Assemblies, etc. “The outcome of this process is bound to be a true reflection of the wishes of the generality or majority of Nigerians. I thank you all for granting me the audience to contribute my thoughts to this national cause.”",

        "content": "Bill Walton, a former NBA MVP and Hall of Famer who then became a legendary broadcaster, died from cancer Monday, according to multiple reports. He was 71 years old. “Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,” NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. Walton starred at UCLA under John Wooden before being selected No. 1 overall in the 1974 NBA Draft, where he embarked on a career with the Trail Blazers, Clippers and Celtics across 10 seasons — with five seasons entirely lost to foot injuries mixed in. Walton had a long career as a broadcaster for CBS, NBC and ESPN. He initially joined ESPN in 2002 after 12 years at NBC to serve as their lead NBA analyst, and in 2012, he began calling games again with the network — this time as a college basketball analyst for Pac-12 broadcasts. Walton, who won one NBA title with Portland and another with Boston, became known for his unique style of broadcasting, with bizarre and hilarious moments scattered throughout the games that often had little to do with the action on the court. He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993. “As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position,” Silver continued in his statement. “His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. “But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.”",

        "content": "LAHORE: Prime Minister’s Adviser on Public and Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah has said that after Nawaz Sharif, the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), will be unanimously agreed on Shehbaz Sharif’s name for the party’s presidency. Announcing the ruling PML-N’s intra-party elections, the former federal minister said that party supremo Nawaz Sharif would be seen proactively \"playing his role in national politics soon\". Sanaullah, addressing a press conference in Lahore on Monday, announced that the ruling party commenced the process of the intra-party elections by the PML-N’s constitution and an election commission was also established by a central working committee. The PML-N stalwart said that nomination papers were issued from 9am to 5pm today which would also be continued before 12pm by tomorrow (Tuesday). \"Scrutiny of the nomination papers will be performed at 1pm, whereas, candidates could withdraw their nominations by 2:30pm, tomorrow.\" He added: “Overall, 11 nominations have been issued so far. At 3pm tomorrow, final lists of the candidates will be issued and a general council’s session will be held afterwards.” He added that the party would organise the polls for electing its president at 4pm tomorrow. Sanaullah went on to say that Bashir Memon, Irfan-ul-Haque Siddiqui, Ishaq Dar, Raja Muhammad Farooq, Hafiz Hafeez-ur-Rehman and Shah Ghulam Qadir have received their nomination papers today. He said that Shahid Khaqan Abbasi — a disgruntled PML-N leader who had applied to register a new political party last month — could also submit his nominations, however, the scrutiny committee will decide on his “eligibility” to contest the party’s intra-party polls. Regarding Nawaz, the PML-N senior leader said that the entire party agreed on the former premier’s name for the party’s presidency. \"However, the party would welcome if someone else wants to submit nominations for taking part in the upcoming polls.\" Sanaullah further said that Nawaz transformed the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz into a popular public party after Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah that ruled the country four times. “In case no candidates, the party’s president would be elected unopposed, otherwise, polling will be held via a show of hands,” he added. The politico said that Nawaz was not angry with someone and was fully active in national politics. He added that all decisions of the federal and the Punjab governments would be taken after Nawaz's approval. He further said that lesser statements from the PML-N supremo would be ended, soon. The premier’s aide added that the ruling PML-N was considering recommendations to reshuffle the party positions. He said that Shehbaz Sharif would be the next leader after Nawaz on which the entire party was agreed upon for the presidency. He praised Shehbaz, the incumbent prime minister, for making maximum efforts to pull the country out of the economic crisis. To a question regarding the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Sanaullah replied that he would continue to warn the nation against the former ruling party’s founder Imran Khan. He added that he was continuously warning the nation that the ousted premier would push the country into a big turmoil. The former security czar said that he was unaware of sources pushing the incarcerated PTI founder for making political blunders, however, “stupidity” could be committed by any individual. “I would pray for the PTI founder not to face the same consequences as Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,” he added.",

Amazon.com Inc. ‘s AMZN cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is negotiating with the Italian government to invest billions of euros to expand its data center operations in the country. This initiative is part of the tech giant’s strategy to enhance its cloud services across Europe, as reported by Reuters on Monday. Discussions are ongoing regarding the scale and location of the investment, with options including expanding AWS’s current site in Milan or establishing a new one. AWS Presence In Europe AWS initially launched its infrastructure in Italy in 2012, and the company had planned to invest 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) in the country by 2029. The planned investments by AWS are expected to contribute 3.7 billion euros to Italy’s GDP by 2029. AWS's client roster in Italy includes notable names such as luxury carmaker Ferrari N.V. RACE , insurer Assicurazioni Generali Sp A ARZGF and energy provider Enel . On Sunday, Amazon’s cloud division recently congratulated Ferrari’s Formula 1 driver Charles Leclerc on social media platform X, following his victory at the Monaco Grand Prix. Last week, AWS announced a significant investment of 15.7 billion euros ($17 billion) to expand its data centers in Spain’s Aragon region through to 2033. This new commitment replaces an earlier plan announced in 2021, which earmarked 2.5 billion euros over 10 years for the country. Although AWS’s investment in Italy is expected to be substantial, it might not reach the magnitude of its investment plans for Spain. In Germany, AWS has also announced plans to invest 7.8 billion euros through 2040.

        "description": "Tom Brady shared a video from Memorial Day weekend showing him on the water with two of his kids, Vivian and Benjamin, set to Post Malone's \"I Had Some Help.\"",
        "content": "Tom Brady gave fans a glimpse of his Memorial Day weekend family plans, which included a lot of fun in the sun. The former NFL quarterback posted a video May 27 of highlights from the weekend set to Post Malone and Morgan Wallen's song \"I Had Some Help.\" The video begins with a grinning, shirtless Brady driving a boat and then cuts to a shot of a young girl, who could be the 46-year-old's daughter, Vivian, in the water with goggles on. Other moments in the clip show a boy diving into the water, Brady wakeboarding, two kids tubing and the seven-time Super Bowl champion sharing a moment on the boat with his son Benjamin. Brady shares Benjamin and Vivian with ex-wife Gisele Bündchen. He also has an older child, Jack, from his previous relationship with Bridget Moynahan . Bündchen recently shared some important life lessons she's learned from parenting. While talking about her two kids on “ The Tonight Show ” March 22, the supermodel had some advice for host Jimmy Fallon. Fallon said he didn't want his relationship with his daughters , Winnie, 10, and Frances, 9, to change as they head into their teenage years. But Bündchen assured him that everything will be OK, as long as he keeps an open line of communication with them. “The most important thing (is) you have to make time to have conversations, because, I think, you know, they are changing, like every day is like a whole new world, and it’s so important to kind of talk,\" she said. \"It’s a huge thing.” Bündchen and Brady got married in 2009 and finalized their divorce in October 2022. In September 2023, Brady's kids showed support for their dad when they attended a special ceremony announcing the former NFL star's induction into the New England Patriots' Hall of Fame. Brady wore his old Patriots jersey with the No. 12 on it when he was feted during halftime of the team's game against the Philadelphia Eagles at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, on Sept. 10. Brady's three kids honored their dad by wearing matching Patriots jerseys with his old number. In June 2023, Brady told TODAY.com that he wants the best for his children. “What do I hope for as a parent?\" he said. \"That they find something they love to do and a great group of friends who love them for who they are.” “Fatherhood is a great responsibility — being available and present is the most important thing,” added Brady. “Something that I continue to work on is making sure I have enough time to connect. It’s always a work in progress.” Here's what to know about Brady's three children. Jack, 16 Born John Edward Thomas, Brady’s oldest child goes by Jack. Brady and Moynahan welcomed him in August 2007. While Brady revealed last year Jack was playing high school football, he said on ESPN’s “NFL Live “ in June he hopes his son doesn’t play professional football . “I wouldn’t choose for him to (play football), because there’s too many crazy expectations that people would put on him, most of them probably very unfair, actually,” Brady said. “I hope he finds the things in his life that allow him to get up every day to be internally motivated to work hard at something he loves to do,” he added. Brady has long shared his passion for football with Jack. In honor of Jack’s 16th birthday this year, the former NFL quarterback dedicated a sweet post to the teenager on Instagram . “16 years of joy with the (sweetest, kindest, most loving etc etc 🥰❤️) son, brother, friend and teammate any parent could ever hope for,” Brady wrote. “You have changed our lives since the day you were born and everyday since has been such a blessing for everyone who knows you and is lucky to have you in their life.” Benjamin, 14 Brady married Bündchen in February 2009, and the pair welcomed their first child , Benjamin Rein, in December 2009. “When Benny came along, I thought he would be just like Jack,\" Brady told “ Men’s Health \" in 2019. \"So I was like, ‘C’mon, let’s do this.’ And he was like, ‘Nope.’ And I was like, ‘What? No, do this!’ And Gisele kept saying to me, ‘Would you effing understand that your son is different?’ It was hard for me. I was like, ‘What do you mean? He’s a boy; he should just do all these things that I do.’ The reality is that Benny just likes different things. And it’s great because now I just have to go do what he wants to do. When we do that, we have the best time. He’s like, ‘OMG, Dad, you’re so funny.’ He loves joking, and I joke back.” Brady has a forever football fan in Benjamin. In December 2022, the athlete shared a text message from his middle child, sent before one of his games. “I will be watching,” wrote Benjamin in the message. “Say hi to me on camera.” He added, “Go and do what you do best. Kick some butt.” Brady declared the text message “The best motivation any Dad can have!!” adding, “I love you, Benny.” In a Sept. 4 episode of his “Let’s Go!” podcast , Brady, who said he’s “always going to love throwing” a football, revealed that he and Benjamin play in the backyard as Benjamin is gearing up to get out on the field himself. But, it turns out, Ben doesn’t want to be like his famous dad: His role model is Gronk. Brady said that Benjamin has many talents, from being a musician to an artist, but this year for the first time he expressed an interest in playing football. Brady revealed that his son’s football idol is his former teammate Rob Gronkowski. “(Benjamin) told me this year, ‘Dad, I’m playing football.’ And I was like, ‘What do you wanna play?’ And he was like, ‘Tight end. I wanna be like Gronk!’” Brady recalled. After hearing the news, Brady shot Gronkowski a text, saying, “Yo, my boy wants to be like you,” which the former quarterback said Gronkowski “loved.” “He wants to be a tight end like Gronk, and he’s gonna be a little beast,” Brady concluded. In December 2023, Brady and Bündchen celebrated Benjamin's 14th birthday. The pair both took to Instagram to give him a sweet shout-out. “My son Benny, can you believe it? Fourteen years old already!” Brady, a former New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback, wrote in an Instagram slideshow of the teen. “It seems like yesterday you were running around in your superhero cape, and now you’re definitely a superhero to me,” wrote Brady. “You’ve grown so much, and not just in height (seriously, watch out @gronk ),” Brady added, tagging former NFL tight end Rob Gronkowski, who Ben previously identified as his football role model. “You’ve grown in kindness, smarts, and all-around awesomeness. Your ability to make people laugh, your knack for solving problems, and your endless debating skills make you a force to be reckoned with.” Brady added, “We love you so much. You are a blessing to us all and we adore you! P.S. No, you can’t stay up until 3 AM playing video games now that you’re 14. Nice try tho.” Bündchen wrote her own tribute on an Instagram photo slideshow: “Happy birthday to the sweetest boy! You have the biggest heart and I feel so lucky I get to learn with you everyday.” “Te amo muito,” she added in her native Portuguese (Translation: I love you lots). “Ps. One day your baby will stand as tall as you are,” Bündchen wrote. “And you won’t be ready for it.” Vivian, 11 Brady and Bündchen's second child, Vivian Lake , was born in December 2012. Clearly her mother's look-alike, Vivian can even unlock the supermodel's phone with its Face ID function, according to a March 2023 Vanity Fair interview with Bündchen. Vivian throws the football around with her dad, but she was quick to call him out when he got impatient with his former teammates. “My daughter always says, ‘Daddy, you did not have a happy face out there.’ And I’m trying!\" Brady said last year on his podcast “Let’s Go! With Tom Brady, Larry Fitzgerald, and Jim Gray,” as reported by “ People .” He added, \"I wish I would have more awareness of what the scowl looks like, but I’m doing my best to try to get to a better place and better peace of mind out there.\" Brady also indulges his daughter's interests, recently at a Blackpink concert. \"This is the most 'dad takes his daughter and her friends to a concert' picture ever taken,\" Brady tweeted , sharing a photo of himself in the crowd. In December 2023, Brady celebrated Vivian's 11th birthday on Instagram . The football star paid tribute to his “little angel\" by sharing a number of photos of her over the years. “Watching you grow into the amazing person you are brings me so much joy,” he captioned the post. “You are always a bright star to all of us. Keep shining girlie girl, and never stop being the special, unique person you are. I love you to the moon and back.” Bündchen also posted in honor of Vivian’s special day and included photos of herself and her daughter riding horses and doing beachside yoga. “Happy birthday my little sunshine!” the Brazilian supermodel captioned her post . “I am so proud of you in every way. Thank you for making my life so much brighter!”",

        "description": "Secretaries of state participating in the discussion on \"how to safeguard democracy\" said they were worried about misinformation.",
        "content": "A group of bipartisan secretaries of state has warned that \"disinformation\" poses the biggest threat to this year's election. Officials from Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia spoke at a panel discussion on how to \"safeguard democracy\" on Sunday. The upcoming election, likely between President and presumptive nominee , will take place against the backdrop of 2020 when Trump claimed that Biden's win was not legitimate. host said on the show that a third of the country still believes this. The group discussed their worries about misinformation and threats in the context of the \"ugliness\" that followed, as Michigan State Secretary Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, described it. Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, said: \"I think the biggest challenge that we are all facing in November is the perpetuation of the mis- and disinformation from government officials in the United States of America. This is the problem that is bigger than any other problem.\" But the conversation turned to artificial intelligence, which Fontes called \"an amplifier and a magnifier of mis- and disinformation.\" He recalled his office's tabletop exercise where they made an eerily real-looking AI-generated video of him making an announcement. Fontes said he wanted to \"make sure that our elections officials were aware of it, we had processes to deal with it within each of our counties.\" His office also held exercises with media partners \"so they would know how to react to it and recognize\" AI. They are currently carrying out exercises with law enforcement. Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt, a Republican, said: \"We're monitoring this environment—we have a team focused on it. \"I think one of the biggest concerns is how much AI has developed in the past few years. In 2020, we saw absurd threats—they just spread so easily,\" Schmidt said. \"People getting motivated by someone's idiot uncle posting something on .\" The officials also discussed the threats that politicians and election workers faced in the wake of the 2020 election. Fontes took a very serious line about it, saying that \"threats against election officials is domestic terrorism.\" Schmidt reminded voters that elections are \"run by your neighbors\" in local jurisdictions and that they are \"protecting democracy.\" They also all encouraged people to ask questions about elections and how they work so that they could have faith in this year's results. \"Elections have never been more safe and secure, with a voter-verifiable, paper ballot record of every vote that is cast that is used in not one but two audits,\" Schmidt said. \"When you know more about elections, you have more confidence in them.\" Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.

        "content": "KEY WEST, Fla. (WFLA) — A fleet of wacky “do it yourself” vessels set sail from Key West on Sunday, battling it out in an annual competition that raises money for local veterans. In the Schooner Wharf Minimal Regatta, competitors must fashion a boat and paddles out of just a single sheet of plywood, some two-by-fours and duct tape. The creatively-designed vessels can be surprisingly intricate, ranging from simple canoes to recreations of the Titanic and pirate ships. The teams are asked with staying afloat long enough to complete a short course without ending up in the water. “Costumes and themed entries are encouraged, and many boats end up being more scenic than seaworthy,” the competition’s website reads. “Entries in past regattas have included alligators, spaceships, guitars, wine bottles and replicas of schooners, shrimp boats, pirate vessels and paddle boats!” Sailors can win prizes in categories like “most creative design” and “fastest boat.” Organizers present the “sinker awards” to captains who go down with their ships. The $20 entry fee goes to support the local American Legion Post 28.",

        "content": "Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], May 27 (ANI): After Knight Riders clinched a major victory against Sunrisers Hyderabad in the final match of the Indian Premier League 2024, besties Suhana Khan, Ananya Panday, and Shanaya Kapoor celebrated the joyous occasion by posing with the IPL trophy at a party. Ananya and Shanaya shared a picture on Monday from what appeared to be an after-party of the Kolkata Knight Riders as the team lifted the IPL 2024 trophy. In the photo, the trio could be seen posing happily with the trophy as they faced the camera. Shanaya wore a black dress, while Ananya and Suhana chose orange and blue outfits respectively. Reacting to the picture, Suhana dropped purple hearts. https://www.instagram.com/p/C7eOFSKtB7F/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA== KKR's third title celebrations began at the same ground Chepauk where they lifted their title in 2012 under the leadership of Gautam Gambhir. They scripted an encore to lift their third trophy. The KKR bowlers left the Sunrisers dumbstruck to restrict the free-scoring SRH batting line-up at 113. In reply, KKR chased the total in 10.3 overs with eight wickets in hand. (ANI) Meanwhile on the work front, Ananya's next project is 'Call Me Bae,' set to premiere on Amazon Prime Video on September 6, 2024. The series, created by Ishita Moitra and directed by Collin D'cunha, boasts a star-studded cast including Vir Das, Gurfateh Pirzada, Varun Sood, Vihaan Samat, Muskkkaan Jaferi, Niharika Lyra Dutt, Lisa Mishra, and Mini Mathur.

        "content": "Former Helix High School and UCLA basketball star had been battling cancer Bill Walton, a San Diego sports and community legend who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. Walton attended Helix High School, where he became the most accomplished boys basketball player in San Diego history. He never strayed far from the city, owning a now-iconic home near Balboa Park and traversing San Diego’s communities on his bike. Walton was a regular at concerts — he was in the crowd last month, when Neil Young and Crazy Horse played at San Diego State — and sporting events. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Visual storytelling Bill Walton, the Helix High School basketball great who became a San Diego city icon in retirement, has died, the NBA said. Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” U-T sports editor Ryan Finley contributed to this story.",

        "content": "Home | News | Two Central Organisations Tipped For Studies On Kaleshwaram Still Uncertain Two central organisations tipped for studies on Kaleshwaram still uncertain The government was keen in conducting the studies only by engaging the competent organizations of the Central government. By Telangana Today Published Date - 27 May 2024, 10:48 PM Hyderabad: Though the State government planned to conduct further studies related to the three key barrages of the Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project (KLIP), only one of them has responded positively and has already received the work order. The Pune-based Central Water and Power Research Station (CWPRS) was one of the three central organizations tipped for conducting the further studies and tests that were suggested by the National Dam Safety Authority. The CWPRS was tasked with investigating structural issues in the barrages. Its experts have promptly responded to the call and completed the preliminary exercise. The CWPRS specializes in hydraulic studies and will focus on stability analysis, foundation investigations, reservoir competency, and the health diagnosis of dams. The irrigation department had finalized the work order on its commitment that the assignment would be completed well within the given timeframe. Also Read Kaleshwaram Probe: One central agency reaches Medigadda The Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute (CMERI) has also been requested to extend its services. Though it responded positively, there was no further progress in talks with its representatives. They have furnished a list of tools and machinery required to investigate the lapses, if any, in the project, and the irrigation department was keen on procuring the machinery required for its team to start working. The Hyderabad-based National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI) is also one of the three central organizations, whose services were sought for undertaking studies on the three barrages of the KLIP. Its final response is awaited, said officials. The government was keen in conducting the studies only by engaging the competent organizations of the Central government. Since multiple tests and studies are to be conducted on the barrages at Medigadda , Sundilla and Annaram, no single organization can be expected to complete the task before the monsoon sets in, said the officials. The Engineer-in- Chief (General), G Anil Kumar, visited Medigadda barrage to take stock of the interim works in progress in view of Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy’s visit the project in the week-end.

        "content": "Satyendra Pathak DOHA: Held under the patronage of the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs HE Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, the 20th edition of Project Qatar was inaugurated by the Minister of Finance HE Ali bin Ahmed Al Kuwari in Doha on Monday. Organised by IFP Qatar with the support of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and in partnership with the Public Works Authority (Ashghal), the four-day international trade exhibition specialising in construction technology and building materials will continue till May 30 at the Doha Exhibition and Convention Center. Featuring 130 Qatari firms and 120 international companies from 25 countries, the milestone edition of Qatar's largest and longest running construction exhibitions opened to a large crowd. The inauguration was graced by several distinguished guests and official delegations including Assistant Undersecretary for Industry and Business Development Affairs at the Ministry of Commerce & Industry Saleh bin Majid Al Khulaifi and a large number of prominent business leaders. Additionally, the ceremony garnered global attention with the presence of over 60 ambassadors from participating countries and heads of diplomatic missions in Qatar, along with dozens of international trade delegations who visited the event. In light of the impressive turnout at the Doha Exhibition and Convention Center, IFP Qatar General Manager Haidar Mshaimesh expressed heartfelt gratitude for the trust bestowed upon the exhibition by esteemed leaders in Qatar and various global sectors and markets. Mshaimesh said, “The construction market in Qatar is on the brink of a transformative era with the aim to fulfil the Qatar National Vision 2030. This new chapter emphasises the development of industrial and social infrastructure projects, seamlessly integrating cutting-edge technologies and elements of smart cities into construction endeavours.” He said, “Over the past 19 years, Project Qatar has consistently kept pace with market trends and requirements, building a rich legacy and playing a pivotal role in this sector. As we embark on this new phase, Project Qatar will remain at the forefront, leading the way in facilitating commercial exchanges between Qatar and the global community. It will also continue to serve as a direct conduit for the sharing and exchange of products, services, and expertise. The presence of esteemed dignitaries at today's opening ceremony underscores the exhibition's value and prominence.” Mshaimesh said, “The 20th edition of Project Qatar marks a significant transformation in terms of sectoral diversity. Emerging sectors such as smart manufacturing, sustainable construction, and digital innovation account for a significant portion of the participation. As Qatar seeks to attract foreign investment and expertise to support its ambitious infrastructure ongoing and planned projects, the event focuses on strengthening partnerships between Qatari and international companies, attracting exhibitors and visitors from key markets worldwide, and facilitating cross-border collaborations and joint ventures.” Pointing out that the composition of exhibitors at Project Qatar has evolved over the years to reflect changes in the construction industry and broader economic trends, he said, “While the event has traditionally featured a wide range of sectors related to construction and building materials, there has been a notable shift towards incorporating new technologies, sustainable solutions, and smart manufacturing practices in recent years.” Mshaimesh said, “The 20th edition of Project Qatar has attracted a large number of exhibitors offering green building solutions, renewable energy technologies, energy-efficient products, and sustainable construction practices.

        "content": "Former President Donald Trump blasted the anti-Israel protests erupting across US college campuses as a “radical revolution” and vowed to deport any foreign students involved if he were re-elected, he told donors in New York this month. “One thing I do is [with] any student that protests — I throw them out of the country. You know, there are a lot of foreign students,” Trump told the group during a May 14 roundtable, according to the Washington Post . “As soon as they hear that, they’re going to behave,” the defiant 2024 hopeful added. During the meeting, at least one of the donors reportedly bemoaned the possibility that one of the student protesters could eventually rise to political power in the future. But Trump, 77, assured the donors he would fight to end the “radical revolution” on college campuses, declaring it “has to be stopped now,” the Washington Post reported. Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt blamed President Biden for empowering the protesters in a statement to The Post Monday. “Joe Biden has sided with radical leftist Democrats like Ilhan Omar and Rashida Talib and empowered antisemitic protestors destroying our college campuses and threatening to undermine our democracy,” Leavitt said. “President Trump will side with Jewish Americans and American citizens, period, and he will not tolerate terrorist sympathizers on our college campuses.” The 45th president has also publicly vowed to clamp down on anti-Israel protesters. Weeks after the bloody Oct. 7, 2023 surprise Hamas attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis, Trump pledged to deport the “resident aliens” who joined the “pro-jihadist protest.” “If you hate America, if you want to abolish Israel, if you sympathize with jihadists, then we don’t want you in our country, and you’re not going to be getting into our country,” Trump told the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas back in October. “I will cancel the student visas of Hamas sympathizers on college campuses and all resident aliens who join in pro-Jihadists protests,” he went on. “Come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you.” Throughout his first term, Trump courted close ties with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He moved the US embassy to Jerusalem and helped broker the Abraham Accords. After departing the White House, however, the former president began souring on Netanyahu in the public eye. He has complained that Netanyahu “let us down” just before the US killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in 2020. During a wide-ranging interview with Time magazine published last month , Trump opened up about his beef with Netanyahu and claimed that Israel pulled out of the operation to kill the top Iranian general. “That was going to be a joint [attack] and all of a sudden, we were told that Israel was not doing it,” he told Time. “And I was not happy about that. That was something I never forgot. And it showed me something.” President Biden, 81, has also clashed with Netanyahu over concerns that Israel isn’t sufficiently trying to minimize civilian casualties in its war with Hamas. Meanwhile, Trump has publicly expressed some misgivings about the manner in which Israel has conducted the war against Hamas, contending that the US ally is “absolutely losing the PR war.” “Every night, they’re releasing tapes of a building falling down. They shouldn’t be releasing tapes like that. They’re doing, that’s why they’re losing the PR war,” Trump vented to conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt last month. “They’ve got to finish what they started, and they’ve got to finish it fast, and we have to get on with life.” However, despite his reservations with Netanyahu, Trump reportedly told donors at the New York roundtable this month that he intends to back Israel if he returns to the presidency.",

        "description": "It's been 80 years since claims about the so-called \"Mad Gasser of Mattoon\" inspired small town residents to believe they were targets.",
        "content": "Dizziness. Chirping in the ears. Migraines. Memory loss. These are just a few of the symptoms of Havana Syndrome — the mysterious sudden-onset illness that is said to have affected more than 100 US diplomats, White House staffers, intelligence agents and their family members. Last Wednesday, the House homeland security subcommittee on counterterrorism, law enforcement and intelligence heard testimony from retired army officer Greg Edgreen, claiming that “America’s best men and women in national security are being targeted and neutralized.” This echoed a “60 Minutes” bombshell report that aired March 31, claiming Russian intelligence operatives could be behind the debilitating syndrome that first surfaced in Havana, the capital city of communist Cuba. Theories about the cause have included the use of electromagnetic or radio frequency energy , chemical attacks, ionizing radiation or acoustic signals. But multiple US intelligence agencies insist that the culprit is not a foreign adversary . Instead, the FBI’s Behavioral Unit, and others in the scientific community, believe Havana Syndrome’s victims were probably suffering from “mass psychogenic illness,” when people start feeling sick even though there is no physical or environmental reason for their illness. It’s similar to a “mass hysteria” that terrorized the residents of a small town in the American heartland during World War II — who believed they had been sickened by a madman who gassed or anesthetized them while they slept in their beds. Long lost to history, this year marks the 80th anniversary of the hysteria that struck dozens of working-class residents of Mattoon, Illinois, who claimed to have suffered from some of the same symptoms that have befallen Havana syndrome victims today. The Mattoon case became public for the first time on September 1, 1944, when a local newspaper reported an interview with Aline Kearney, a cabbie’s wife and mother of three-year-old Dorothy Ellen. She had gone to bed around 11 p.m. and noticed a “sickening, sweet odor” that “grew stronger and I began to feel a paralysis of my legs and lower body. “I grew frightened and screamed for Martha,” her sister-in-law, who “at once noticed the odor.” She summoned a neighbor who called the police, which was now down to just 10 officers because of the wartime draft. Upon arrival, officers were told a mysterious figure in all black had been spotted near the house, and that he had used an anesthetic — chloroform, ether, or a combination of both — to make Aline Kearney ill. Some 90 minutes later, her husband arrived home, spotted a tall figure at the window — a man, and possibly a woman, who would soon be dubbed ‘The Mad Gasser of Mattoon.” Mr. Kearney gave chase and the police were called once again, but the search was fruitless. By then, Mrs. Kearney’s paralysis was gone and she had recovered the use of her legs and arms. Virtually overnight, more Mattoon residents reported being gassed by the supposed fiend. In all, several dozen claimed to be victims by the time the scare ended weeks later. The story hit the big-time national media, including Time magazine and the Associated Press — with the latter reporting: “Mattoon gets jitters from gas attacks, comparing nervous Mattoon residents to Londoners under protracted aerial blitzing.” According to the September 18, 1944, issue of Time , “The Mad Anesthetist began his nocturnal visitations two weeks ago, mainly concentrating his fiendish attacks on women. One said a smell like gardenias ‘made her legs tingle.’ Another said a ‘fat man had squirted perfume into her bedroom.'” An account from Mrs. Carl Cordes got wide play, after she claimed to have found a damp pink cloth on her back porch. Cordes said she sniffed it out of curiosity, fell ill and told police she “felt as though a charge of electricity had gone through me.” Taken to the hospital, she had reportedly suffered temporary paralysis and, incredibly, burns. Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update. Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy . Never miss a story. An investigator from the Illinois Criminal Investigation Laboratory was dispatched to Mattoon from the Windy City, 230 miles away, to probe the pink cloth, but the lab found no evidence of gas, or any chemicals on it. But the investigator, one Richard T. Piper, nonetheless announced that he thought the “anesthetist” was probably using a heavy, colorless liquid of some sort. Meanwhile, five Chicago chemists called the whole case a “hoax.” With Mattoon gripped by fear, the police and townsmen formed a virtual posse in search of the monster — like a scene out of Frankenstein, but using flashlights instead of torches. Vigilantes armed with shotguns patrolled the deserted streets at night, prompting Mattoon’s alarmed police commissioner to declare, “I wouldn’t walk through anybody’s backyard at night now for $10,000.” Police Chief C.E. Cole demanded that “roving bands of men and boys should disband. They’re in grave danger of being shot.” Locked and barred in their homes, frightened residents took loaded weapons to bed with them. At the same time, as Time noted, “Chicago newsmen swept joyfully down upon Mattoon and wired leering accounts of The Gas Fiend, The Thin Man of Mattoon, The Mad Phantom and The Screwball Chemist.” At one point during the first two weeks of that hellish September, 17 families on just a single Mattoon block claimed they had been gassed, causing nausea and weird feelings to their arms and legs. But near the end of the month, with little or no attacks reported, and with no suspect caught, there were serious suspicions that a gasser — and the gas — never existed. It was then that the Illinois state’s attorney, William Kidwell, shut down the case, declaring that the Mad Gasser was clearly a wave of mass hysteria that had consumed the town. Blame was also placed on journalists who had hyped the story from day one — when Mattoon’s Daily Journal-Gazette front-page headline about the Kearney case read, “Anesthetic Prowler on Loose.” The Illinois Times chalked it up to wartime madness, noting that “when so many men were off fighting and so many women left alone, the gassings have been explained away as a product of paranoia, panic and delirium.” As for today’s controversial cases, a report — “ Havana Syndrome: A Post Mortem ” — in the March issue of the International Journal of Social Psychiatry concluded that the six-year investigation by US officials was like going down a “rabbit hole” in the search for “exotic explanations.” “Instead of finding secret weapons and foreign conspiracies,” the report said, “they found only rabbits.”",

        "content": "THUNDER BAY – This past year, Enactus Lakehead, an entrepreneurship club based on Lakehead’s Thunder Bay campus has been working on their new project called Brain Blitz. The project focuses on educating high school and university students on the basics of entrepreneurship and in demand soft skills, while providing students opportunities to practice what they have learned through hands on work at Hackathons. From their project, the team impacted 753 youth since May 2023, helping improve the social, environmental, and economical health of Canada – along with the mental health of Lakehead students. Recently at the National Exposition, 49 teams from all over Canada came together to pitch their projects to a panel of industry professionals. From the competition, Enactus Lakehead was honoured as the runner-up in the opening round of competition but were unfortunately not chosen to move on to the semi-finals. Although the competition was the main purpose of the trip, participants also got the opportunity to network with student teams from all across Canada as well as share best practices from their experiences in their teams. Nick Bruni, President of Lakehead’s Faculty of Business Student Association and Presenter for Enactus Lakehead said “this opportunity is one that will not be forgotten, and one I hope to take advantage of in the future.” The team thanked LUSU and the Lakehead Faculty of Business Administration for their support of the trip, as well as their numerous sponsors which were recognized at the Enactus Lakehead Annual General Meeting. Lastly, the team would not be where they are without the help and support of their faculty advisor, Alyson MacKay, manager of Ingenuity, Lakehead’s business incubator, as well as project advisor and Enactus alum, Silas Young. Many people likely remember Enactus’s largest event, Pie a Prof, from earlier this year when students were given the opportunity to put a pie into the face of some professors and Lakehead University staff. This helped students take their minds off their studies for a short period before exams and provided an outlet for mental health.",

        "content": "by: Christine Samra Posted: May 27, 2024 / 10:17 AM PDT Updated: May 27, 2024 / 10:55 AM PDT Mike Tyson suffered a medical emergency on a flight headed to Los Angeles from Miami on Sunday night. “Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great,” Tyson’s representatives tell KTLA 5 News. “He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare-up 30 minutes before landing. He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.” In Touch Weekly was the first to report details of the scare. The outlet initially reported that the flight was delayed for a couple of hours due to the emergency, however, Tyson’s reps said that wasn’t the case. “It’s false reporting that his medical attention caused the flight delay,” his team stated. “This two-hour delay was due to an air conditioning issue on the aircraft.” According to the outlet, the flight was delayed 25 minutes once it landed at LAX as paramedics boarded the aircraft to tend to Tyson. This comes a little under two months before Tyson, 57, is set to return to the ring after almost 20 years. On July 20, nearly a month after his 58th birthday, he’ll take on 27-year-old Jake Paul in a boxing match at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The fight will be streamed live on Netflix.

        "content": "Norwich City have agreed compensation close to £400,000 for Nordsjaelland head coach Johannes Hoff Thorup, according to reports. The Canaries are known to have offered Thorup the job, having decided on him over fellow candidates Will Still and Pascal Jansen late last week. The Dane is keen on the move, leaving only negotiations over details. Those negotiations have escalated since the conclusion of the Danish Superliga season at the weekend, with part of those being the compensation fee for Thorup. Those behind the scenes at Carrow Road were relaxed about the agreement of compensation, with other issues including contracts and potential backroom staff included in discussions over recent days. Now Danish outlet Tipsbladet have claimed that a deal has been struck with the Tigers for the transfer of their head coach, whose work permit was sorted during the interview process. Norwich sporting director Ben Knapper has long been a fan of Thorup, who has gained a good reputation across Europe for his development of young players and positive tactical style. Although due diligence included considering other coaches, Thorup was the frontrunner for some time. The 35-year-old declined to discuss reports of a move to England when asked after his last game at Nordsjaelland, telling Viaplay: \"Have I heard anything from [Norwich]? I want to say, as I have also said several times during this season, that when I am employed somewhere, I have so much respect for the place I am employed. \"Just look at this scenery that is behind me right now. I think it would be so disrespectful of me to go out and talk about other clubs or other situations. \"No matter if it was close or completely miles away - I'm never ever going to go into that because this club means so much that we shouldn't be standing here on the last day of the season talking about everything else.\"",

The Sky Blue Star suffered a 3-2 defeat against Kwara United on Sunday. The visitors conceded three times in the first half before scoring twice late in the game. Ogunmodede commended his players for their performances and vowed to keep pushing for the title. “We will not give up. We will keep fighting to the end. We knew it wouldn’t be easy, but we’ll learn from our mistakes and come back stronger,” he said after the game. “The only disappointment is that we were unable to get the maximum three points. We planned for the win, but unfortunately, we couldn’t get our desired results. “That is the only disappointment. I understand there is no excuse for failure; if not, I would have been talking about the abrupt break we had for a month, so you expect a team to come back and give it their best—it’s impossible. “But nevertheless, it was a good fight. Kwara United took advantage of their early goal; you know this is a team who had the luck of playing about two matches during the holidays, which tells of their match fitness, and the early goal gave them a lot of confidence. We were struggling; they took advantage again and scored their second goal before the whistle sounded for the second half. “We came in the second half and fought hard; we were unlucky and scored an own goal. We wanted to be champions, and we know what it means to be champions—as champions, you don’t give up. So we fought. We got two consolidating goals, but it wasn’t enough.” Related Topics: NPFL Ogunmodede Remo Stars Don't Miss Transfer: Balogun signs one-year contract with Rangers You may like NPFL: New Super Eagles invitee Ismail bags 13th assist Remo Stars’ Ismail celebrates maiden Super Eagles’ invitation Ogunmodede excited with Ismail’s Super Eagles invitation NPFL rejects Katsina United’s request for postponement of Shooting Stars clash 2026 WCQ: Remo Stars celebrate Ismail’s Super Eagles invitation NPFL urges clubs, referees to abide by regulations Advertise About Us Contact Us Privacy-Policy Terms Copyright © Daily Post Media Ltd",

On Sunday, Ramlath began feeling unwell and sought treatment at private hospitals in Mannarkkad and later at Kottathara Government Tribal Hospital. She was subsequently transferred to Thrissur Medical College Hospital for further treatment. However, on Monday morning, Ramlath and Usman went home without the MCH authorities' permission while she was still under observation. After returning home, Ramlath's condition worsened, and she passed away in the afternoon. Health department officials inspected the site and advised those who had been in contact with her to get vaccinated. Meanwhile, the Mannarkkad Station House Officer (SHO) confirmed that her death was due to rabies, and the body will be handed over to her relatives.",

        "description": "Toyota will reportedly end its lucrative sponsorship deal with the IOC after the 2024 Paris Olympics.",
        "content": "We are only two months from the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris , and the games may be about to lose one of its most lucrative partners . According to a report from Japan's Kyodo News , Toyota will end its sponsorship contract with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after this year's games in Paris. The report cited unidentified \"sources close to the matter.\" Toyota has declined to comment on the Kyoda article, according to media reports . Related stories Toyota's deal, announced in 2015, is believed to be the largest sponsorship agreement ever signed by the IOC. At the time, Japanese media reported that it would be worth $835 million. According to Kyodo's report, sources at Toyota were unhappy with how the IOC has used the money. The automaker believes the committee is not doing enough to support the athletes and promote the games. During the Tokyo Summer Olympics in 2021, the IOC was criticized for not doing enough to support the mental health of its competitors . Toyota sources told Kyodo that the company would like to continue sponsoring the Paralympic games. The IOC, however, requires its partners to support all its events. Toyota is one of just 15 \"TOP\" sponsors as part of The Olympic Partner program . TOP is the highest level of sponsorship for the games and is limited to one per industry. Other brands include Coca-Cola, Samsung, Intel, Corona Cero, and Procter & Gamble. Toyota pulled its commercials from the delayed 2021 Olympic games in Tokyo , and executives skipped the opening ceremonies in response to concerns about safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "content": "The Albanians qualified for their second Euros by topping a group including the Czech Republic and Poland. They are in Group B with Italy, Spain and Croatia. “Under pressure? No, we are not,” Sylvinho said at a news conference. \"In the football world, each game is a miracle. Everything can happen. Many things occur. We should go there and play and improve.\" Albania starts its campaign in Germany against defending champion Italy on June 15, followed by two-time quarterfinalist Croatia on June 19 then three-time champion Spain on June 24. “We know the strength of our opponents. They do not play to pass the group but to win the European (Championship),” Sylvinho said. “We go there to show our trust in each other, the team's heart and spirit. That is what we should show at the European.” Sylvinho was appointed in January 2023 to get Albania to Euro 2024, after which his contract ends. The Brazilian declined to answer a question on Monday about whether he wanted to continue as coach, saying only that his focus and energy were on preparing the team for the Euros. Albania hopes to retain Sylvinho in a bid to reach the World Cup for the first time. He and his assistants Pablo Zabaleta of Argentina and Luca Laurenti and Gianluca Stesina of Italy were sworn in as Albanian citizens this week as a reward for qualifying the team for the Euros. The only previous time was in 2016. AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

        "description": "A discharged German military officer has been convicted of spying for Russia and providing documents containing “official secrets” Read Full Article at RT.com",
        "content": "A Dusseldorf court on Monday convicted an erstwhile Bundeswehr captain of spying for Russia and passing along sensitive documents. The military officer was sentenced to three and a half years in prison after pleading guilty to acting as a secret agent and divulging “official secrets.” The 54-year-old defendant, identified only as Thomas H., had contacted the Russian consulate in Bonn in May 2023, reportedly driven by the fear that the conflict between Moscow and Kiev could escalate into a global nuclear war. At the time, the then-captain was working for the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support. The defendant ultimately supplied the consulate with certain internal documents to get passed on to Russian intelligence and offered further cooperation and materials from the military, but ended up being arrested in last August. According to prosecutors, the officer had “almost persistently offered himself to Russia” to give it an advantage in the ongoing hostilities. In addition to nuclear-war fears, the ex-officer blamed his transgressions on severe burnout, on overworking, and on the side effects of a Covid-19 vaccination. “It is the biggest mess I have ever made in my life,” he told the court in his final statement. Earlier, he had pleaded guilty to acting as a secret service agent. The court acknowledged that Thomas H. had no previous convictions, admitted to most of the charges against him, and actively cooperated with the investigators. The judiciary also noted the fact that he was experiencing severe health problems at the time he decided to spy for Moscow. The defendant was sentenced to three and a half years in prison for surrendering “official secrets” to Russia. The arguably mild sentence indicates that the documents he managed to pass along to Russia were not that sensitive and did not contain state secrets. If the latter were the case, the defendant would have faced a much more severe punishment, up to a life sentence.",

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin has begun its rally back to the upside, hovering around the $70k zone, as experts predict a new all-time high. With the price of Bitcoin currently trading at $70,458 as of the time of writing this report, analysts disclosed that the recent approval of Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has amplified the process for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. According to them, this development has the potential to significantly increase demand for Bitcoin and diminish supply. However, as transformative as this has increased access for retail investors, they note that it will pale in comparison to the tidal wave of demand anticipated from institutional investors entering the market.

Recall that after the fourth crypto halving that occurred in April this year, Bitcoin failed to drop below $56k and recovered in a bullish fashion, indicating the emergence of the bullish flag on a broader scale. With the price of Bitcoin surging to the upside, several crypto experts have rolled out their predictions. Crypto expert Michael van de Poppe outlined an important price level from which Bitcoin must break out. He claims that once it achieves a successful breakout, the flagship crypto will see a new all-time high (ATH). Poppe adds that Bitcoin needs to break through $70,000 on a lower time frame (LTF) basis. Once that happens, the analyst claimEd that Bitcoin will likely see a new ATH. He also noted that lower timeframe regions at $67.000 were holding. Meanwhile, he highlighted Bitcoin’s long consolidation, stating that almost three months have passed since the crypto token remained in that range. Economist and crypto trader Mikybull Crypto on his X handle stated that he doesn’t seem to understand why the majority of traders are screaming that the price of Bitcoin is already at the peak of the bull run. Meanwhile, he says, according to the monthly chart, the market is just getting started for a golden bull run for this cycle. In this regard, he further hinted that the majority of traders with bearish sentiments will be caught off guard when the price of Bitcoin begins to rally heavily to the upside. The bitcoin price which is currently trading at around $70,000 per bitcoin, is up almost 400% from its post-FTX collapse lows in late 2022, with the market braced for what’s likely to be a game-changing 2024 US presidential election. US Former President Donald Trump says he is very positive and open-minded to cryptocurrency companies, stating that country must be the leader in the field. In his words, “I will ensure that the future of crypto Bitcoin will be made in the USA. I will support the right to self custody to the nation’s 50 million crypto holders.” Also, it is worth noting that there is an explosive alt-season brewing, as several altcoins have seen their price surged, with pontential move to the upside.",

Irving has been to the NBA mountaintop once before with the in 2016, which has elevated his status over other elite guards without a ring.

According to her, “Due attention is accorded to children with special needs. Therapists and some other professionals have been employed for the three special schools. The State Government’s collaboration with development partners and the World Bank for the development of education in the State has been yielding results. ” The Governor’s wife equally disclosed that her pet project, Widows and Orphans Hope (WAOH) is targeted at assisting the educational development of indigent Ekiti children in addition to various intervention programmes of the state government. She commended the Ministry of Women’s Affairs for organizing the event to celebrate the children in the state, noting that the gesture was a testament to the ministry’s commitment to achieving the agenda of the governor Oyebanji for Ekiti children.

        "content": "Veteran Super Eagles and Rangers defender, Leon Aderemi Balogun, has signed a new deal that will see him stay at the club for another year, Soccernet.ng reports. The 35-year-old joined the Scottish record Champions for a second spell from Queens Park Rangers last summer, but the move didn’t pan out how he wanted it, as he could only play 18 games all season. After signing for the Gers on a year contract for a second stint, Balogun’s contract was set to expire at the end of this season. Soccernet.ng earlier reported that Rangers boss, Philippe Clement, was impressed with his performances towards the end of the season before the former Mainz 05 man picked up an injury that kept him out of the Scottish Cup final. The 46-time capped Super Eagles defender is also keen on extending his stay at Ibrox. According to The Scottish Sun , Philippe Clement has rewarded Balogun’s performances with a new deal that will see him continue at the club for another season. Rangers are set to bolster their central-defensive options over the coming weeks and it’s believed Levski Sofia stopper – Jose Cordoba, is top of their wishlist. While Rangers are in renewal talks with John Souttar, Connor Goldson, Ben Davies and Leon King, they will also be parting ways with John Lundstram, Borna Barisic, Ryan Jack and John McLaughlin who are all out of contract at the end of the season, and Balogun’s experience will help the club’s new signings to settle in nicely. Balogun last played for Nigeria in their 10-0 win over São Tomé and Príncipe, coming off the substitute’s bench with 19 minutes left to play.",

        "description": "Rishi Sunak faced questions after a leaked memo from Conservative headquarters blamed MPs and ministers for failing to get behind the election effort.",
        "content": "Rishi Sunak insisted he took responsibility for the Conservatives’ election campaign after a leaked memo criticised MPs and ministers over a lack of effort. Staff at Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) accused MPs of going on holiday, refusing to knock on doors and focusing on ministerial responsibilities rather than the election effort. News of the leak emerged as Government minister Steve Baker defended going for a break in Greece rather than campaigning in his constituency. The document was accidentally emailed to MPs by a senior campaigning figure at CCHQ, the newspaper reported. The message had two attachments – a constituency breakdown with sanitised comments and another containing the unguarded comments of Conservative staff. The document reveals seats which are short of funding and singles out some MPs for criticism over their efforts. In Plymouth Moor View, the seat of veterans minister Johnny Mercer, staff said there was a issue with “MP co-operation with CCHQ” and “funding issues — currently £2k in bank” and support had been offered. Environment minister Rebecca Pow, who is standing in Taunton and Wellington, was “still too focused on ‘ministerial business’ and non-committal on time she will spend in the seat now and during the campaign”, the memo said. In Cheadle, Mary Robinson is “away for seven days on holiday” during the campaign, the memo said. A “lack of co-operation” was also noted for Northern Ireland minister Mr Baker. The Daily Mirror revealed that he continued with his holiday plans during what was supposed to be the parliamentary recess. “The Prime Minister told everyone we could go on holiday and then called a snap election,” he told the Mirror from Vasiliki. “So I’ve chosen to do my campaign work in Greece.” The Wycombe MP added: “I’ve been campaigning for months and my wife deserves to have her husband go away for a much needed break. It’s the only holiday we’ve got planned for the summer.” Asked about the start of the campaign, the Prime Minister told ITV News: “Of course this is my responsibility, and I actually enjoyed the last few days. “A few days into this and I’ve been in the East Midlands and West Midlands, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland here in the South East.” Asked why CCHQ was blaming MPs, Mr Sunak dodged the question: “What I’m doing is talking to people everywhere, about the choice of this election, and I was very clear that I’ve got a clear plan that I’m working through and you can see that that is happening with the economy.”",

        "content": "“ Desert of Namibia ,” about a caustic 21-year-old Japanese wanderer, embodies its protagonist’s listlessness to a fault. Director Yôko Yamanaka was still a teenager when she made her debut feature “Amiko” in 2017, a sharply funny high school film with the jagged, quick-cut energy of a YouTube travel vlog. It marked her as a Gen Z voice to watch. “Desert of Namibia” similarly follows a young woman trying to find herself (aged up to match Yamanaka’s own life experience, seven years later), but it swings stylistically in the opposite direction, holding and zooming for hilariously, sometimes painfully long. Your mileage may vary, as the film has a tendency to meander off course, but that is exactly its intention. Actress Yuumi Kawai is immediately magnetic as Kana, a young Tokyo woman hinted to have roots in a different city or country, but the film is often opaque about important details (like the mystery of its title, toward which it provides only elliptical hints). While shot with straightforward clarity, its narrative, like its protagonist’s mood, feels enveloped by fog. When we first meet Kana, as she catches up with a friend, we know little about her apart from her baggy clothes and her mildly sunny disposition that seems to easily slip. Before long, she start sliding into a funk during this introductory scene, when she’s told of an acquaintance’s suicide — news on which she can’t fully concentrate because of an unrelated conversation happening nearby. By capturing this overlapping chatter with ingenious sound and subtitle design, Yamanaka creates a sense of distraction around Kana and about the film as a whole. This also bleeds into Kana’s story of being caught between two different romantic relationships. The man she lives with, Honda (Kanichiro), reflects an air of success, but their dynamic lacks any on-screen spark and chemistry. This pushes her toward the free-spirited artist Hayashi (Daichi Kaneko) and toward a relationship whose novel excitement soon settles into a mutually destructive and even violent status quo. The film often captures Kana as a victim of male social structures (professionally, personally and even medically, when she tries to seek help) but rather than being wholly culpable for her state of mind or a helpless victim, she remains trapped in a vicious cycle of cause and effect, with little promise of escape. Yamanaka captures Kana and Hayashi’s outbursts with a sense of remove, though this has a dueling impact on how the story comes across. In brief moments, the actors’ physical commitment to anguished scuffling — from a place of dissatisfaction that neither character understands — is devastating to watch. But the more it goes on, the more numbing these scenes become. This may suit Yamanaka’s intentions of telling a story about depressed characters falling into a passionless routine, but it occasionally strays into comedic territory when filmed at a distance. Yamanaka lets her tonal control lapse during these vital moments, but she maintains deft command over absurd timing when the film refuses to cut away from mundane moments and activities, like establishing shots of Kana simply walking from one location to the next. It’s a flourish that feels grinding and punishing at first, to the point that “Desert of Namibia” starts to seem more suited for home viewing than in a theater, if only so that one can fast-forward through these scenes. However, the film becomes self-reflexive about this idea as well, with a brain-tickling, meta-textual flourish that hints at Kana’s own desire to be able to skip through the drawn-out scenes of her daily life. This also leads to the puzzling conundrums about whether a movie that’s “bad on purpose” is still “bad,” the way a person might be “bad” if they try hard enough to push people away. Though in this case, Yamanaka’s work defies such binaries by being the ideal version of its imperfect self. Like Kana, it’s gloomy, purposeless and hard to love — but that only makes the film, and its lead, feel more pulsating alive.",

        "content": "Mr Wike stated this in Abuja on Monday, after he inspected the Southern Parkway Road and Abuja Rail Mass Transit, in preparation for commercial inauguration on May 29. According to Mr Wike, Mr Tinubu has done very well in FCT and the country in just one year, particularly in physical infrastructure and human capital development. “Mr President “Renewed Hope” agenda is no longer a story; it’s a reality. It is a promise made and a promise fulfilled. “I think Mr. President has done very very well in terms of reassuring Nigerians that he is committed to deliver the dividend of democracy. “From what we have seen on the ground, there is really hope for Nigerians. “So, we are very happy.” He added that in FCT, Tinubu has rekindled the hope of civil servants by instituting their career progression “and I am sure the civil servants are happy”. The minister noted that although there were some areas that needed to be looked into, one year was not enough for Tinubu to deliver 100 per cent expectations of Nigerians. On the inauguration of the projects, Mr Wike said: “We are good to go; just putting finishing touches. “We have been to the Southern Parkway, and we are 100 per cent ready. Here in the Metro Line, we are also ready. “We are happy that all our efforts have come to fruition. “The residents are very happy and by the end of the day, the train services will be available for Nigerians. “So, for us at FCTA, we are very very happy,” the minister said.

        "content": "The NHL fined New York Rangers captain Jacob Trouba $5,000 on Monday for elbowing Florida Panthers forward Evan Rodrigues. The incident occurred late in the second period in Game 3 on Sunday. Trouba received a two-minute minor for the elbow as well as a minor penalty for slashing during the same sequence. Rodrigues, who was struck in the side of the face, left the ice with help but eventually returned in the third period. Trouba, 30, contributed two assists on Sunday in Sunrise, Fla., as New York won 5-4 in overtime to seize a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals. Trouba has one goal and six assists in 13 games this postseason. The defenseman tallied 22 points (three goals, 19 assists) and 73 penalty minutes in 69 games during the regular season.

        "content": "The road to Omaha has officially begun with the 64-team field for NCAA Division I baseball championship being revealed. Tennessee is the No. 1 (50-11) overall seed after dominating for the entire year and winning the SEC regular-season title and conference tournament. The rest of the top four includes two other SEC schools -- Kentucky at No. 2, Texas A&M at No. 3 -- and North Carolina at No. 4. LSU will look to defend its title on the road in the Chapel Hill Regional with its first game against Wofford, and elsewhere, the Bryan-College Station Regional should bring the drama with the opportunity for Texas A&M to face in-state rival Texas. Notably, Florida State is back in the tournament after missing it for the first time since 1977 last year. The SEC and ACC are each hosting five regionals. The other host regional sites include two schools from the Big 12, two from the Pac-12 -- Arizona was crowned the last Pac-12 champion and is hosting -- and one from the AAC and one from the Big West. Oklahoma is hosting for the first time since 2010, and UC Santa Barbara is hosting for its first time on campus as the only other time the school hosted was in 2015 and did so at a neutral location.

        "content": "A single lightning strike in Colorado killed a rancher and more than 30 head of cattle on Saturday, according to multiple reports. Mike Morgan, 51, was hit by a lightning bolt while feeding his herd from a trailer outside the town of Rand, about 80 miles northwest of Denver, The Associated Press reported , citing the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office and the county coroner. Advertisement About 100 cattle were knocked off their feet by the blast, which killed 34 of them. “As best I can tell, it hit him on the trailer,” local coroner George Crocket told The Colorado Sun. “The cattle were bunched up around the trailer and it hit them all.” Morgan’s father-in-law and wife were close by on the farm at the time but survived the strike, Crocket said. Emergency services attempted to save Morgan, who was pronounced dead at the scene. Crocket said that a single lightning bolt killing multiple animals was unusual. “I’ve seen horses get killed, but it’s usually one at a time,” he told the Sun. HuffPost has contacted the sheriff’s office for comment.

        "content": "Former Mamelodi Sundowns player Lovers Mohlala has spoken about how frustrating it was to miss out on a move abroad, when the club rejected an offer from a Danish club. Soccer Laduma spoke to the retired player to talk about the years he spent with the Tshwane giants. I was there from 1997 until 2003 I think. My time at Sundowns was very nice and painful as well. The nicest part about being at Sundowns was that we were a team that was winning. Players dedicated their lives to represent the Sundowns badge. At some point, I was frustrated. Frustrated how? Remember FC Conpenhagen bought Sibusiso Zuma? I actually went for trials there. They were supposed to buy me. They offered $400 000 to Sundowns. But Sundowns wanted $700 000. The painful part is that what Motsepe is doing today, Sundowns did not do back then. We didn't get bonuses for the Champions League. They said we would share what we win, but we lost in the final and we did not get a cent. We had great players, the likes of Alex Bapela, John Tlale, Roger Feutmba and (Joel) Fire Maselela. We had a bunch of good players and there was unity. We were not celebrity. We were protected by king pins and taxi owners. Even in the township, the Sundowns players would not be hijacked so easily. I remember Albert Kometsi who used to play for Swallows was hijacked. Then we called around and we told him that he would find his car at the police station, but he would not find the tyres and the radio. We were protected and we were not paying a protection fee. We had the nicest time at Sundowns, but there was no money. I'll tell you one thing...the highest that I earned at Sundowns was R12 000. We were playing with players who really wanted to win. The painful part is that you retire in football, but you can't even enter the yard at Sundowns. That's the sad part. When you play, there is no pension. We are the only ones who pay tax and not get a pension fund. That's the sad part of football. My first game was against Chiefs and we beat them 4-1. I was on the bench and Bra Stan said 'boy, what''s your nickname?' Then he said 'today, your name is Horse'. I created two goals that day. That's where I started. I knew when I got there, I had already made a mark for myself. When I got there, it was a matter of showing my skill. It was frustration. They did not want to sell me to Copenhagen. When Copenhagen bought Zuma, Sundowns refused to sell me. They gave me the offer in my hand. They called Sundowns and they even offered me a salary. That's when I got frustrated.",

        "content": "Getting a medical staffing company prepared to compete for $43 billion worth of work will be a \"bit of a crystal ball exercise,\" says Bill Rivard. Rivard is CEO and founder of Matrix Providers, which specializes in recruiting and placing health care professionals across the nation's military bases. Denver-based Matrix on Thursday joined 10 other companies selected to fill a $43 billion contract to recruit thousands of health care workers for the national network of Army, Navy, and Air Force bases over the next 15 years. It's the federal government's largest health care staffing contract yet, enlarged in part to respond to the national health care staffing shortage, said Rivard, an optometrist who spent 21 years on active duty with the Army and seven with the reserves. The constraints of the national staffing shortfall, coupled with the fact that health care jobs serving the military look a bit different, means that Rivard has his work cut out for him. > Read the full story at the Denver Business Journal.

        "content": "Proactive Investors - Analysts at UBS remain optimistic on the long-term value of cloud-based software provider Workday Inc (NASDAQ: WDAY ) after it delivered a mixed report for the first quarter. The analysts reiterated their ‘Buy’ rating on the stock but lowered their price target from $350 to $330. Workday shares closed 15.3% lower at $221 on Friday. The analysts wrote that among key areas to watch is the company’s calculated remaining performance obligations (CRPO), which was 18% in line with the Street for Q1 but guidance of 15% to 16% for 2Q was below expectations of 17.5%. The company also lowered its fiscal 2025 subscription revenue guidance to 17% growth, compared to its earlier guidance of up to 18%. Management noted the impact of elevated scrutiny in large new deals in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and lower customer headcount growth as factors behind its guidance. “We believe the large deals are in the pipeline, but conversions are taking time due to higher-than-expected scrutiny,” the analysts wrote. Regarding investor concern that the EMEA growth challenges may be due to competitive reasons, they wrote that their checks indicate Workday’s win rates remain stable. Positives from Workday’s first quarter report include traction in its FINS offering and securing the Defense Intelligence Agency as a Federal customer, the analysts highlighted. “Despite the near-term challenges, we believe CEO Carl Eschenbach is putting the right initiatives in place focusing on FINS, international, and Federal, but those will take time to play out,” they wrote. “Despite the guide down, we believe Workday can sustainably grow top line in the mid to high teens over the medium-term while delivering margins in the mid to high 20s for a collective rule of 40 story.” Read more on Proactive Investors CA Disclaimer",

        "content": "A BBC star was kicked off a flight after asking passengers not to eat peanuts because of her daughter’s peanut allergies, with the act leaving the pilot infuriated. British weather presenter Georgie Palmer together with her husband Nick Sollom and their two kids Rosie and Annie were asked to get off a SunExpress flight from London Gatwick to Dalaman in Turkey on Tuesday. The popular TV personality shared a lengthy Instagram post slamming the Turkish-German airline for not only kicking her family off the flight, but for refusing to make a standard announcement asking passengers not to eat peanuts. The 49-year-old explained that she instead had to ask passengers not to eat peanuts, adding that they were happy to do. But the flight’s captain allegedly demanded the family leave before he took off. “I thanked the beautiful souls on our plane for helping us,” she said in the Instagram post, according to The Sun. “Many of them hugged, cheered and held our hands as we were forced to disembark. “The SunExpress captain and cabin crew refused to make the standard announcement on behalf of our daughter. “We gently asked the passengers at the front of the plane to share our request. “Row by row, all the passengers turned back to kindly ask the row behind to please not eat nuts on the flight. “It was calm, earnest and with an overwhelming sense of solidarity and empathy.” Georgie added: “There’s no beef with simple asks like these. People get it! “We were hoofed off the plane after the angry little captain shouted at us from the cockpit.” She said they were discriminated against for “simply having an allergy”. According to The Sun, the family booked into an airport hotel and took an easyJet flight to Dalaman the next day – costing them an extra $6,385. Georgie told the Daily Mail : “The captain decided because of my daughter’s allergy he didn’t want to fly with her on board. “When he found out I had spoken to the other passengers he was screaming at me from the cockpit. “He was so angry, the next thing I knew we were told to get off the plane. “How we were treated was disgusting – nobody working on that plane showed one ounce of compassion.” A SunExpress spokesman said: “We take the safety of our passengers very seriously. “Shortly after boarding our flight, the passenger raised a concern about one of his family group having a serious peanut allergy. “They requested an announcement to other passengers. We refrain from making these kinds of announcements. “Like many other airlines, we cannot guarantee an allergen-free environment on our flights. “Nor can we prevent other passengers from bringing food items containing allergens on board. “Due to the insistent behaviour of the passenger to others on board, the captain decided it would be safest if the family did not travel. “When this was explained to the passenger, he behaved aggressively towards our crew members and tried to gain access to the cockpit. “To ensure the safety of our crew and our passengers on board, we cannot tolerate aggressive and unruly behaviour on our flights. “Our website states that passengers must notify us 48 hours in advance of any special care required due to a medical condition. “No such notification was received from the passengers in this instance.” The spokesman added: “However, we are fully aware that this was an upsetting situation for the family. “We are taking the incident as an opportunity to conduct a review of the information provided during our booking process. “This will ensure more effective solutions for passengers with allergies.” According to The Sun, Sollom denies acting aggressively. Many have taken to social media to weigh in on the debacle, with plenty of users siding with the pilot. “The pilot is a national treasure,” one person wrote. “As they should have been,” a second wrote, referring to the family getting kicked off. “Would have booted them off as well,” another agreed. A fourth wrote: “I think this story would be found under Self Entitlement in the dictionary.” – with The Sun",

        "description": "Government offers limited information, says foreign investment reviewed for security risks",
        "content": "The Ministry of Innovation, Science and Industry has ordered the shuttering of two B.C. based technology companies, one of which makes drones with military applications. In a brief statement posted Friday (May 24), Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne said two companies must be dissolved, following a national security review. The companies in question are Bluvec Technologies Inc. and Pegauni Technology Inc. “The government’s decisions are based on facts and evidence and on the advice ofCanada’s security and intelligence community, and other governmentpartners,” Champagne said in the news release. “While Canada continues to welcome foreign direct investment, we will act decisively when investments threaten our national security.” Bluvec, based in Burnaby, makes a drone detection system, which has potential military applications. As reported by Glacier Media last year, Bluvec was successfully sued by another Burnaby drone detection company , Skycope Technologies for stealing proprietary source code. The founders of both Bluevec and Skycope were friends who originally worked for the same cybersecurity company in China, according B.C. Supreme Court documents. The principals of Bluvec identified in the lawsuit are Junfeng Jia (aka Jack Jia), Leyuan Pan (aka Michael Pan), Kunyu Zhang (aka Eric Zhang) and Qianqi Zhuang (aka Tim Zhuang). Also listed as defendants in the case were Xiaoqian Wu (aka Karl Wu) and Jiawei Li. The principal of Skyscope Technologies is Zhenhua (Eric) Liu, according to the court ruling. The court case notes that both Bluvec and Skyscope developed technology that “enables users to detect and block or ‘jam’ unwanted drones.” Bluvec and two of its principals – Junfeng Jia and Leyuan Pan – were ordered to pay Skycope Technologies $800,000 for breaching employment agreements with Skycope. Reached for comment, a spokesperson for Bluvec said Jack Jia was unavailable. [email protected] twitter.com/nbennett_biv",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden marked Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation's fallen toward creating a more perfect union, \"for which they lived, and for which they died for.\" From left, President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Army Major Gen. Trevor Bradenkamp, listen to the playing of Taps during an Armed Forces Full Honors Wreath Ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday in Arlington, Va. Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden said each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country's service members is not in vain. President Joe Biden delivers the Memorial Day Address at the 156th National Memorial Day Observance at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday in Arlington, Va. “Freedom has never been guaranteed,” Biden said under gray skies in the memorial amphitheater. “Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” He added: “On this day, we came together again to reflect, to remember, and above all, to recommit to the future they fought for, a future grounded in freedom, democracy, opportunity and equality. Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits, to highlight the importance of honoring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. The ceremony at Pier 86 on Manhattan's West Side honors the members of the armed forces who made the ultimate sacrifice for the country. CBS N... “Last year, the VA delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever in our history,\" Biden said, crediting the PACT Act which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned, not anymore.” Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans, and Gold Star family members. Heart-pounding thrill rides, tasty treats, unique attractions — who doesn't love a trip to an amusement park? In fact, our universal (pun intended) love for amusement parks stretches back much further than you might expect: all the way to 1583. That's when the world's oldest amusement park, Bakken, opened in Denmark. People around the world still flock to amusement parks in the millions today. But when the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020, many of the most popular parks in North America temporarily closed their gates or, at the very least, saw significant drops in attendance. Some parks started to recuperate in 2021 as social distancing restrictions eased, but most stayed relatively empty until 2022. When 2022 did roll around, though, certain parks saw 40-50% spikes in attendance compared to the year prior, while one park's attendance soared by more than 500%. The industry is now firmly back in business, and many amusement parks have implemented new rides, shows, and other exciting experiences to entice visitors to return. To showcase the parks that saw the biggest increases in annual visitors between 2021 and 2022, Stacker looked at data from the Themed Entertainment Association and AECOM . Read on to find out which 13 North American amusement parks have grown the most in popularity in recent years. - Location: Orlando, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 20% - 2022 attendance: 10.8 million Though COVID-19 restrictions in Florida were among the most relaxed in the country, Universal Studios Florida still underwent a major dip in visitors during the pandemic. The park welcomed slightly less than 4.1 million attendees in 2020, compared to the 10.9 million visitors who entered Universal in 2019. But attendance jumped back up in 2022, further bolstered by the 2021 opening of the Jurassic World VelociCoaster elsewhere in the park and a stunt show called the Bourne Stuntacular, which started in 2020. - Location: Orlando, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 21% - 2022 attendance: 11.0 million According to the Themed Entertainment Association and AECOM, Universal's Islands of Adventure accounted for the lion's share of attendance at Universal Orlando Resort in 2022. In fact, visitor numbers at this park alone outstripped three separate Disney World parks: Epcot, Animal Kingdom, and Hollywood Studios. You can find the aforementioned Jurassic World VelociCoaster here, as well as Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, a popular ride that opened in 2019. - Location: San Diego - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 25% - 2022 attendance: 3.5 million Attendance at SeaWorld San Diego in 2022 neared pre-pandemic numbers, which reached 3.7 million in 2019. That could be thanks to the opening of a buzzy new ride, the Emperor Dive Coaster. The tallest and fastest dive coaster in California, the Emperor boasts a breathtaking, 14-story vertical drop. A Mardi Gras event also kicked off for the first time in 2022. - Location: Lake Buena Vista, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 25% - 2022 attendance: 9.0 million Disney's Animal Kingdom still has a ways to go to reach pre-pandemic attendance (nearly 14 million visitors came to the park in 2019), but the return of several popular tours, like the Up Close with Rhinos experience and the Wild Africa Trek, helped boost visitors in 2022. Several key, holiday-themed shows also reappeared, including the Merry Menagerie, a wildlife-themed puppet show and the park's annual Earth Day celebration. - Location: Tampa, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 26% - 2022 attendance: 4.1 million 2022 brought both new events and returning favorites to Busch Gardens Tampa Bay. Celebrations like Cinco de Mayo and Viva La Música took place for the first time, while Mardi Gras, the Food & Wine Festival, and the Real Music concert series returned to the park that year. Busch Gardens also drew crowds to a new ride in March 2022: Iron Gwazi, the tallest hybrid roller coaster in North America. Notably, Busch Gardens' parent company, SeaWorld, reported increased revenue in 2022 compared to 2019, indicating that while there might be fewer visitors, those visitors are happy to spend more money on their experiences. - Location: Lake Buena Vista, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 27% - 2022 attendance: 10.9 million Between 2021 and 2022, Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World didn't have many new attractions to offer visitors. But that didn't stop over a million more attendees from streaming into the park in 2022, as pandemic restrictions continued to lift and Disney celebrated its 50th anniversary. Disney theme parks did roll out the Genie+ line-skipping service starting in 2021, which could have helped increase attendance at Hollywood Studios and other Walt Disney World attractions. - Location: Lake Buena Vista, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 29% - 2022 attendance: 10.0 million Several hugely popular events made their regularly scheduled returns to Epcot at Walt Disney World in 2022, including the Festival of the Arts, which features the Disney on Broadway Concert series. In the summer, Epcot also launched The Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind, a ride that ranks as one of the world's longest enclosed coasters. Last but not least, the fast-casual restaurant Connections Café and Eatery serving up Starbucks favorites opened its doors for the first time in 2022, a major plus for visitors needing a caffeine boost. - Location: Lake Buena Vista, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 35% - 2022 attendance: 17.1 million There's good news and bad news for Magic Kingdom fans. This was the most-visited theme park in the world in 2022, but these visitor stats don't even come close to pre-pandemic numbers, which reached 21 million in 2019. The park also experienced significant construction delays on one of its most anticipated rides, Tron Lightcycle/Run, which was originally slated to open in 2022 but was pushed to 2023. - Location: Orlando, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 46% - 2022 attendance: 4.5 million Just like its West Coast location, SeaWorld Orlando welcomed visitors to a brand-new roller coaster in 2022. The Ice Breaker features four different launches (forward and reverse, in case you were wondering) and the steepest beyond vertical drop in Florida, clocking in at 93 feet tall. Aside from the Ice Breaker, several key attractions, like the Kraken, were updated and given facelifts. The Electric Ocean summertime event also returned to dazzle audiences with two new shows: stunt show Adrenaline and luminescent percussion concert Electroblast. - Location: Universal City, California - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 53% - 2022 attendance: 8.4 million Universal Studios Hollywood made some major moves in 2022, namely opening a new film set, Jupiter's Claim, the Western-themed attraction at the center of the horror film \"Nope.\" Guests can explore Jupiter's Claim and other sets aboard the studio tour, which takes visitors behind the scenes of famous Universal releases. The park's ultra-popular Christmas event, The Awesomest Celebration of the Season, also made a triumphant comeback that year. Festivities took place throughout the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and over in Whoville, where Universal's trademark Grinchmas came to town. - Location: Anaheim, California - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 81% - 2022 attendance: 9.0 million Considering all Disneyland Resort parks were closed for nearly four months in 2021 due to COVID-19 restrictions, and Disneyland offered discounted tickets for Southern California residents in 2022, it's no surprise visitor numbers spiked in the latter year. Several long-missed celebrations, including the Lunar New Year and the Food & Wine Festival, also returned to Disney California Adventure Park. Plus, the character of Raya from the 2021 animated film \"Raya and the Last Dragon\" made her debut here in 2022. - Location: Anaheim, California - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 97% - 2022 attendance: 16.9 million Attendance at Disneyland Park at Disneyland Resort nearly doubled between 2021 and 2022, likely due to the resort's post-pandemic reopening and those aforementioned discounted tickets. But also in 2022, the park's beloved nighttime shows (known as \"spectaculars\") finally kicked off again after the long hiatus. Displays like the Main Street Electrical Parade and Disneyland Forever illuminated the park after dark once more, heralding an eagerly anticipated return to normalcy for visitors. - Location: Maple, Ontario - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 524% - 2022 attendance: 3.8 million The largest theme park in Canada, Canada's Wonderland had a bumpy year in 2022, with one attraction catching fire and others trapping riders during a storm , but millions still entered the park in 2022, a dramatic increase from the prior year. Canada's Wonderland was especially busy in 2022—new events like the Taste of the Caribbean took place, and the water park attraction Mountain Bay Cliffs opened this year, as did the Lazy Bear Lodge restaurant.

        "description": "PHOTO: GETTY IMAGES Rats, my internet’s down.",
        "content": "PHOTO: GETTY IMAGES That’s what 3500 West Coasters said after a major broadband outage was caused by hungry rodents chewing through fibre cables. The internet went down on Sunday night for customers between Greymouth and Westport, just after cellphone alarms nationwide sounded for the annual Civil Defence emergency test. The coincidence prompted many to wonder if the system was overloaded, whereas in fact the problem was traced to rats. Chorus said its team found the fibre cables had been damaged by rodents. The first outage occurred on Saturday night, and a temporary fix was applied. However, because the rodents were still in the ducts, repeat outages occurred over the weekend. \"We have now re-routed all services into the alternative temporary cable, which sits outside of the affected duct,\" a spokeswoman said. Service was restored progressively throughout the weekend, up until just after midnight on Sunday. Chorus said it was working to put protections in place and prevent future incidents, with a new rodent-resistant duct for the fibre cables. \"We do try to minimise the impact of rodents by using rodent resistant ducting where possible and properly sealing duct lines, but unfortunately the critters do get through sometimes. This is particularly the case at this time of year as they're nesting.\" The spokeswoman said the blackout was unrelated to the emergency cellphone test just after 6pm yesterday. — Greymouth Star",

        "description": "The intersection of Gladstone and Gordon Rds in Mosgiel. A Mosgiel mother has described the \"sickening\" moment her daughter was a hair’s breadth from being struck at a notorious intersection in the township.",
        "content": "The intersection of Gladstone and Gordon Rds in Mosgiel. It comes amid calls for something to be done about the intersection of Gladstone and Gordon Rds after a crash there last week. A Mosgiel mother, who asked not to be named, said on May 18 her daughter was almost mowed down by a vehicle after the traffic lights malfunctioned and the driver’s view was obscured by heavy traffic. She said it was \"sickening\" to witness her primary school-aged daughter almost being hit by a car. Her daughter was crossing Haggart-Alexander Dr while a green signal for pedestrians was on, when a driver made a fast right-hand turn to make the gap in traffic. The driver’s red arrow had stopped flashing before the green signal for pedestrians had turned red and the driver’s view was obscured by vehicle congestion on the road. \"The vehicle went right into her pathway while it was travelling really fast — my daughter was very, very lucky it didn’t take her out. \"There is way too many children and way too many vehicles all looking to make it through the intersection.\" The mother said the intersection was already \"quite poorly laid out\", and the recent traffic diversion through Mosgiel while work was carried out on State Highway1 had exacerbated the issue. The layout meant visibility was compromised at the main crossing point where children gathered, and cars turning could not see the children gathered behind vehicles stopped in the pedestrian crossing zone. \"There are a lot of children walking to school between 8am and 9am, this obviously coincides with peak traffic times.\" Mosgiel-Taieri Community Board chairman Andrew Simms said solving the bigger transport issues facing Mosgiel was a \"can that should no longer be kicked down the road\". The inadequacy of the roading network in Mosgiel had been highlighted as a priority in 2013 as part of the Integrated Transport Strategy for Dunedin by the Dunedin City Council. All other priorities had been addressed, except for Mosgiel, Mr Simms said. \"Since 2013, the population of Mosgiel has grown by 30% and heavy transport movements on Gordon Rd had increased by over 300%. \"What the Mosgiel community needs is decisive action. We do not need another study, more hand-wringing and further excuses — we need funding and diggers.\" An NZ Transport Agency Waka Kotahi spokeswoman said the intersection had a complicated layout that demanded drivers’ attention at all times and their patience. \"We are actively managing the intersection of Gladstone Rd and SH87 to minimise journey times.\" NZTA was planning work to improve safety outcomes for drivers going in an out of Mosgiel. \"The intersection optimisation from an NZTA perspective would meet economic growth and productivity, as well as safety improvement aims. \"Given there are local roads intersecting and a KiwiRail track crossing this piece of highway, any future work would involve NZTA, DCC and KiwiRail.\" The spokeswoman said funding would need to be confirmed in September.",

        "content": "The Ministry of Innovation, Science and Industry has ordered the shuttering of two B.C. based technology companies, one of which makes drones with military applications. In a brief statement posted Friday (May 24), Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne said two companies must be dissolved, following a national security review. The companies in question are Bluvec Technologies Inc. and Pegauni Technology Inc. “The government’s decisions are based on facts and evidence and on the advice ofCanada’s security and intelligence community, and other governmentpartners,” Champagne said in the news release. “While Canada continues to welcome foreign direct investment, we will act decisively when investments threaten our national security.” Bluvec, based in Burnaby, makes a drone detection system, which has potential military applications. As reported by Glacier Media last year, , Skycope Technologies for stealing proprietary source code. The founders of both Bluevec and Skycope were friends who originally worked for the same cybersecurity company in China, according B.C. Supreme Court documents. The principals of Bluvec identified in the lawsuit are Junfeng Jia (aka Jack Jia), Leyuan Pan (aka Michael Pan), Kunyu Zhang (aka Eric Zhang) and Qianqi Zhuang (aka Tim Zhuang). Also listed as defendants in the case were Xiaoqian Wu (aka Karl Wu) and Jiawei Li. The principal of Skyscope Technologies is Zhenhua (Eric) Liu, according to the court ruling. The court case notes that both Bluvec and Skyscope developed technology that “enables users to detect and block or ‘jam’ unwanted drones.” Bluvec and two of its principals – Junfeng Jia and Leyuan Pan – were ordered to pay Skycope Technologies $800,000 for breaching employment agreements with Skycope. Reached for comment, a spokesperson for Bluvec said Jack Jia was unavailable.",

        "description": "Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, President Joe Biden said each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country's service members is not in vain.",
        "content": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden marked Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation's fallen toward creating a more perfect union, \"for which they lived, and for which they died for.\" From left, President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Army Major Gen. Trevor Bradenkamp, listen to the playing of Taps during an Armed Forces Full Honors Wreath Ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday in Arlington, Va. Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden said each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country's service members is not in vain. President Joe Biden delivers the Memorial Day Address at the 156th National Memorial Day Observance at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday in Arlington, Va. “Freedom has never been guaranteed,” Biden said under gray skies in the memorial amphitheater. “Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” He added: “On this day, we came together again to reflect, to remember, and above all, to recommit to the future they fought for, a future grounded in freedom, democracy, opportunity and equality. Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits, to highlight the importance of honoring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. The ceremony at Pier 86 on Manhattan's West Side honors the members of the armed forces who made the ultimate sacrifice for the country. CBS N... “Last year, the VA delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever in our history,\" Biden said, crediting the PACT Act which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned, not anymore.” Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans, and Gold Star family members. Heart-pounding thrill rides, tasty treats, unique attractions — who doesn't love a trip to an amusement park? In fact, our universal (pun intended) love for amusement parks stretches back much further than you might expect: all the way to 1583. That's when the world's oldest amusement park, Bakken, opened in Denmark. People around the world still flock to amusement parks in the millions today. But when the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020, many of the most popular parks in North America temporarily closed their gates or, at the very least, saw significant drops in attendance. Some parks started to recuperate in 2021 as social distancing restrictions eased, but most stayed relatively empty until 2022. When 2022 did roll around, though, certain parks saw 40-50% spikes in attendance compared to the year prior, while one park's attendance soared by more than 500%. The industry is now firmly back in business, and many amusement parks have implemented new rides, shows, and other exciting experiences to entice visitors to return. To showcase the parks that saw the biggest increases in annual visitors between 2021 and 2022, Stacker looked at data from the Themed Entertainment Association and AECOM . Read on to find out which 13 North American amusement parks have grown the most in popularity in recent years. - Location: Orlando, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 20% - 2022 attendance: 10.8 million Though COVID-19 restrictions in Florida were among the most relaxed in the country, Universal Studios Florida still underwent a major dip in visitors during the pandemic. The park welcomed slightly less than 4.1 million attendees in 2020, compared to the 10.9 million visitors who entered Universal in 2019. But attendance jumped back up in 2022, further bolstered by the 2021 opening of the Jurassic World VelociCoaster elsewhere in the park and a stunt show called the Bourne Stuntacular, which started in 2020. - Location: Orlando, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 21% - 2022 attendance: 11.0 million According to the Themed Entertainment Association and AECOM, Universal's Islands of Adventure accounted for the lion's share of attendance at Universal Orlando Resort in 2022. In fact, visitor numbers at this park alone outstripped three separate Disney World parks: Epcot, Animal Kingdom, and Hollywood Studios. You can find the aforementioned Jurassic World VelociCoaster here, as well as Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, a popular ride that opened in 2019. - Location: San Diego - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 25% - 2022 attendance: 3.5 million Attendance at SeaWorld San Diego in 2022 neared pre-pandemic numbers, which reached 3.7 million in 2019. That could be thanks to the opening of a buzzy new ride, the Emperor Dive Coaster. The tallest and fastest dive coaster in California, the Emperor boasts a breathtaking, 14-story vertical drop. A Mardi Gras event also kicked off for the first time in 2022. - Location: Lake Buena Vista, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 25% - 2022 attendance: 9.0 million Disney's Animal Kingdom still has a ways to go to reach pre-pandemic attendance (nearly 14 million visitors came to the park in 2019), but the return of several popular tours, like the Up Close with Rhinos experience and the Wild Africa Trek, helped boost visitors in 2022. Several key, holiday-themed shows also reappeared, including the Merry Menagerie, a wildlife-themed puppet show and the park's annual Earth Day celebration. - Location: Tampa, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 26% - 2022 attendance: 4.1 million 2022 brought both new events and returning favorites to Busch Gardens Tampa Bay. Celebrations like Cinco de Mayo and Viva La Música took place for the first time, while Mardi Gras, the Food & Wine Festival, and the Real Music concert series returned to the park that year. Busch Gardens also drew crowds to a new ride in March 2022: Iron Gwazi, the tallest hybrid roller coaster in North America. Notably, Busch Gardens' parent company, SeaWorld, reported increased revenue in 2022 compared to 2019, indicating that while there might be fewer visitors, those visitors are happy to spend more money on their experiences. - Location: Lake Buena Vista, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 27% - 2022 attendance: 10.9 million Between 2021 and 2022, Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World didn't have many new attractions to offer visitors. But that didn't stop over a million more attendees from streaming into the park in 2022, as pandemic restrictions continued to lift and Disney celebrated its 50th anniversary. Disney theme parks did roll out the Genie+ line-skipping service starting in 2021, which could have helped increase attendance at Hollywood Studios and other Walt Disney World attractions. - Location: Lake Buena Vista, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 29% - 2022 attendance: 10.0 million Several hugely popular events made their regularly scheduled returns to Epcot at Walt Disney World in 2022, including the Festival of the Arts, which features the Disney on Broadway Concert series. In the summer, Epcot also launched The Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind, a ride that ranks as one of the world's longest enclosed coasters. Last but not least, the fast-casual restaurant Connections Café and Eatery serving up Starbucks favorites opened its doors for the first time in 2022, a major plus for visitors needing a caffeine boost. - Location: Lake Buena Vista, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 35% - 2022 attendance: 17.1 million There's good news and bad news for Magic Kingdom fans. This was the most-visited theme park in the world in 2022, but these visitor stats don't even come close to pre-pandemic numbers, which reached 21 million in 2019. The park also experienced significant construction delays on one of its most anticipated rides, Tron Lightcycle/Run, which was originally slated to open in 2022 but was pushed to 2023. - Location: Orlando, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 46% - 2022 attendance: 4.5 million Just like its West Coast location, SeaWorld Orlando welcomed visitors to a brand-new roller coaster in 2022. The Ice Breaker features four different launches (forward and reverse, in case you were wondering) and the steepest beyond vertical drop in Florida, clocking in at 93 feet tall. Aside from the Ice Breaker, several key attractions, like the Kraken, were updated and given facelifts. The Electric Ocean summertime event also returned to dazzle audiences with two new shows: stunt show Adrenaline and luminescent percussion concert Electroblast. - Location: Universal City, California - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 53% - 2022 attendance: 8.4 million Universal Studios Hollywood made some major moves in 2022, namely opening a new film set, Jupiter's Claim, the Western-themed attraction at the center of the horror film \"Nope.\" Guests can explore Jupiter's Claim and other sets aboard the studio tour, which takes visitors behind the scenes of famous Universal releases. The park's ultra-popular Christmas event, The Awesomest Celebration of the Season, also made a triumphant comeback that year. Festivities took place throughout the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and over in Whoville, where Universal's trademark Grinchmas came to town. - Location: Anaheim, California - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 81% - 2022 attendance: 9.0 million Considering all Disneyland Resort parks were closed for nearly four months in 2021 due to COVID-19 restrictions, and Disneyland offered discounted tickets for Southern California residents in 2022, it's no surprise visitor numbers spiked in the latter year. Several long-missed celebrations, including the Lunar New Year and the Food & Wine Festival, also returned to Disney California Adventure Park. Plus, the character of Raya from the 2021 animated film \"Raya and the Last Dragon\" made her debut here in 2022. - Location: Anaheim, California - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 97% - 2022 attendance: 16.9 million Attendance at Disneyland Park at Disneyland Resort nearly doubled between 2021 and 2022, likely due to the resort's post-pandemic reopening and those aforementioned discounted tickets. But also in 2022, the park's beloved nighttime shows (known as \"spectaculars\") finally kicked off again after the long hiatus. Displays like the Main Street Electrical Parade and Disneyland Forever illuminated the park after dark once more, heralding an eagerly anticipated return to normalcy for visitors. - Location: Maple, Ontario - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 524% - 2022 attendance: 3.8 million The largest theme park in Canada, Canada's Wonderland had a bumpy year in 2022, with one attraction catching fire and others trapping riders during a storm , but millions still entered the park in 2022, a dramatic increase from the prior year. Canada's Wonderland was especially busy in 2022—new events like the Taste of the Caribbean took place, and the water park attraction Mountain Bay Cliffs opened this year, as did the Lazy Bear Lodge restaurant.

        "content": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden marked Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation's fallen toward creating a more perfect union, \"for which they lived, and for which they died for.\" From left, President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Army Major Gen. Trevor Bradenkamp, listen to the playing of Taps during an Armed Forces Full Honors Wreath Ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday in Arlington, Va. Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden said each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country's service members is not in vain. President Joe Biden delivers the Memorial Day Address at the 156th National Memorial Day Observance at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday in Arlington, Va. “Freedom has never been guaranteed,” Biden said under gray skies in the memorial amphitheater. “Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” He added: “On this day, we came together again to reflect, to remember, and above all, to recommit to the future they fought for, a future grounded in freedom, democracy, opportunity and equality. Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits, to highlight the importance of honoring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. The ceremony at Pier 86 on Manhattan's West Side honors the members of the armed forces who made the ultimate sacrifice for the country. CBS N... “Last year, the VA delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever in our history,\" Biden said, crediting the PACT Act which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned, not anymore.” Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans, and Gold Star family members. Heart-pounding thrill rides, tasty treats, unique attractions — who doesn't love a trip to an amusement park? In fact, our universal (pun intended) love for amusement parks stretches back much further than you might expect: all the way to 1583. That's when the world's oldest amusement park, Bakken, opened in Denmark. People around the world still flock to amusement parks in the millions today. But when the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020, many of the most popular parks in North America temporarily closed their gates or, at the very least, saw significant drops in attendance. Some parks started to recuperate in 2021 as social distancing restrictions eased, but most stayed relatively empty until 2022. When 2022 did roll around, though, certain parks saw 40-50% spikes in attendance compared to the year prior, while one park's attendance soared by more than 500%. The industry is now firmly back in business, and many amusement parks have implemented new rides, shows, and other exciting experiences to entice visitors to return. To showcase the parks that saw the biggest increases in annual visitors between 2021 and 2022, Stacker looked at data from the Themed Entertainment Association and AECOM . Read on to find out which 13 North American amusement parks have grown the most in popularity in recent years. - Location: Orlando, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 20% - 2022 attendance: 10.8 million Though COVID-19 restrictions in Florida were among the most relaxed in the country, Universal Studios Florida still underwent a major dip in visitors during the pandemic. The park welcomed slightly less than 4.1 million attendees in 2020, compared to the 10.9 million visitors who entered Universal in 2019. But attendance jumped back up in 2022, further bolstered by the 2021 opening of the Jurassic World VelociCoaster elsewhere in the park and a stunt show called the Bourne Stuntacular, which started in 2020. - Location: Orlando, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 21% - 2022 attendance: 11.0 million According to the Themed Entertainment Association and AECOM, Universal's Islands of Adventure accounted for the lion's share of attendance at Universal Orlando Resort in 2022. In fact, visitor numbers at this park alone outstripped three separate Disney World parks: Epcot, Animal Kingdom, and Hollywood Studios. You can find the aforementioned Jurassic World VelociCoaster here, as well as Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, a popular ride that opened in 2019. - Location: San Diego - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 25% - 2022 attendance: 3.5 million Attendance at SeaWorld San Diego in 2022 neared pre-pandemic numbers, which reached 3.7 million in 2019. That could be thanks to the opening of a buzzy new ride, the Emperor Dive Coaster. The tallest and fastest dive coaster in California, the Emperor boasts a breathtaking, 14-story vertical drop. A Mardi Gras event also kicked off for the first time in 2022. - Location: Lake Buena Vista, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 25% - 2022 attendance: 9.0 million Disney's Animal Kingdom still has a ways to go to reach pre-pandemic attendance (nearly 14 million visitors came to the park in 2019), but the return of several popular tours, like the Up Close with Rhinos experience and the Wild Africa Trek, helped boost visitors in 2022. Several key, holiday-themed shows also reappeared, including the Merry Menagerie, a wildlife-themed puppet show and the park's annual Earth Day celebration. - Location: Tampa, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 26% - 2022 attendance: 4.1 million 2022 brought both new events and returning favorites to Busch Gardens Tampa Bay. Celebrations like Cinco de Mayo and Viva La Música took place for the first time, while Mardi Gras, the Food & Wine Festival, and the Real Music concert series returned to the park that year. Busch Gardens also drew crowds to a new ride in March 2022: Iron Gwazi, the tallest hybrid roller coaster in North America. Notably, Busch Gardens' parent company, SeaWorld, reported increased revenue in 2022 compared to 2019, indicating that while there might be fewer visitors, those visitors are happy to spend more money on their experiences. - Location: Lake Buena Vista, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 27% - 2022 attendance: 10.9 million Between 2021 and 2022, Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World didn't have many new attractions to offer visitors. But that didn't stop over a million more attendees from streaming into the park in 2022, as pandemic restrictions continued to lift and Disney celebrated its 50th anniversary. Disney theme parks did roll out the Genie+ line-skipping service starting in 2021, which could have helped increase attendance at Hollywood Studios and other Walt Disney World attractions. - Location: Lake Buena Vista, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 29% - 2022 attendance: 10.0 million Several hugely popular events made their regularly scheduled returns to Epcot at Walt Disney World in 2022, including the Festival of the Arts, which features the Disney on Broadway Concert series. In the summer, Epcot also launched The Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind, a ride that ranks as one of the world's longest enclosed coasters. Last but not least, the fast-casual restaurant Connections Café and Eatery serving up Starbucks favorites opened its doors for the first time in 2022, a major plus for visitors needing a caffeine boost. - Location: Lake Buena Vista, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 35% - 2022 attendance: 17.1 million There's good news and bad news for Magic Kingdom fans. This was the most-visited theme park in the world in 2022, but these visitor stats don't even come close to pre-pandemic numbers, which reached 21 million in 2019. The park also experienced significant construction delays on one of its most anticipated rides, Tron Lightcycle/Run, which was originally slated to open in 2022 but was pushed to 2023. - Location: Orlando, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 46% - 2022 attendance: 4.5 million Just like its West Coast location, SeaWorld Orlando welcomed visitors to a brand-new roller coaster in 2022. The Ice Breaker features four different launches (forward and reverse, in case you were wondering) and the steepest beyond vertical drop in Florida, clocking in at 93 feet tall. Aside from the Ice Breaker, several key attractions, like the Kraken, were updated and given facelifts. The Electric Ocean summertime event also returned to dazzle audiences with two new shows: stunt show Adrenaline and luminescent percussion concert Electroblast. - Location: Universal City, California - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 53% - 2022 attendance: 8.4 million Universal Studios Hollywood made some major moves in 2022, namely opening a new film set, Jupiter's Claim, the Western-themed attraction at the center of the horror film \"Nope.\" Guests can explore Jupiter's Claim and other sets aboard the studio tour, which takes visitors behind the scenes of famous Universal releases. The park's ultra-popular Christmas event, The Awesomest Celebration of the Season, also made a triumphant comeback that year. Festivities took place throughout the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and over in Whoville, where Universal's trademark Grinchmas came to town. - Location: Anaheim, California - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 81% - 2022 attendance: 9.0 million Considering all Disneyland Resort parks were closed for nearly four months in 2021 due to COVID-19 restrictions, and Disneyland offered discounted tickets for Southern California residents in 2022, it's no surprise visitor numbers spiked in the latter year. Several long-missed celebrations, including the Lunar New Year and the Food & Wine Festival, also returned to Disney California Adventure Park. Plus, the character of Raya from the 2021 animated film \"Raya and the Last Dragon\" made her debut here in 2022. - Location: Anaheim, California - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 97% - 2022 attendance: 16.9 million Attendance at Disneyland Park at Disneyland Resort nearly doubled between 2021 and 2022, likely due to the resort's post-pandemic reopening and those aforementioned discounted tickets. But also in 2022, the park's beloved nighttime shows (known as \"spectaculars\") finally kicked off again after the long hiatus. Displays like the Main Street Electrical Parade and Disneyland Forever illuminated the park after dark once more, heralding an eagerly anticipated return to normalcy for visitors. - Location: Maple, Ontario - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 524% - 2022 attendance: 3.8 million The largest theme park in Canada, Canada's Wonderland had a bumpy year in 2022, with one attraction catching fire and others trapping riders during a storm , but millions still entered the park in 2022, a dramatic increase from the prior year. Canada's Wonderland was especially busy in 2022—new events like the Taste of the Caribbean took place, and the water park attraction Mountain Bay Cliffs opened this year, as did the Lazy Bear Lodge restaurant.

        "description": "Nairn County have confirmed season ticket prices will remain unchanged for next season, but under-16s will get free entry at Station Park.",
        "content": "Preparations for the 2024/25 Highland League season have continued in earnest at Nairn County. The Wee County have unveiled their new home shirt for the upcoming season, featuring thin black stripes and the club’s new badge, as well as sponsors Murray Travel. It will be available for purchase from the Town Barbers on Nairn’s High Street at the beginning of June. Fixtures for the next Highland League campaign have also been released, with Ross Tokely’s men given a tricky start after the summer. On the opening day of the season on Saturday, July 27, Nairn will travel to defending champions Buckie Thistle – although that match is subject to change depending on the Jags’ League Cup group stage fixture list. Should there be a clash, Nairn’s first league game will take place on Wednesday, July 31 at Victoria Park. The weekend after it does not get any easier, with 2023/24 runners up Brechin City due to make the journey to Station Park. Nairn’s first scheduled midweek fixture of next season will be a derby away at Clachnacuddin on Wednesday, August 7, which is then set to be followed by a trip to another side who will hope to be in title contention, Banks O’Dee. The first round of the Highland League Cup has also been slotted into the calendar, due to take place on Saturday, November 9. With the fixture list being released, excitement will naturally begin to build about the return of football at Station Park, and season tickets are on sale at the same prices as last season. Under-16s, though, will get free entry for all league matches in the 2024/25 campaign. More good news in the meantime as goalkeeper Dylan Maclean has signed a new contract to remain at the club. Maclean’s new deal will see him remain with Nairn until the summer of 2026. The 28-year-old shot stopper has already spent eight seasons as the Wee County’s number one, having made his debut from the bench at home against Brora Rangers on September 9, 2015. He made his first start in the same fixture on the opening day of the following season, and has since gone on to make 186 appearances for the club, keeping 40 clean sheets. Maclean is a three-time supporters’ player of the year, and won his first piece of silverware in the North of Scotland Cup last season – having played a key role in the semi final win over Caley Thistle, saving the decisive penalty in the shoot-out. Manager Ross Tokely was pleased to have tied down the shot-stopper, saying: \"Dylan has been a regular part of the team for a number of years now and played in all but two of our games last season. \"Having played in front of him for the past season-and-a-half, I know how dependable Dylan is. He is capable of making some great saves throughout the season and is clearly a popular player with the supporters. \"I am delighted with the goalkeepers we have at the club and it is a clean slate when we come back after our summer break, so Dylan and the others will have the chance in training to show they can start the season as the club's number one.\"",

A Mardi Gras event also kicked off for the first time in 2022. - Location: Lake Buena Vista, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 25% - 2022 attendance: 9.0 million Disney's Animal Kingdom still has a ways to go to reach pre-pandemic attendance (nearly 14 million visitors came to the park in 2019), but the return of several popular tours, like the Up Close with Rhinos experience and the Wild Africa Trek, helped boost visitors in 2022. Several key, holiday-themed shows also reappeared, including the Merry Menagerie, a wildlife-themed puppet show and the park's annual Earth Day celebration. - Location: Tampa, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 26% - 2022 attendance: 4.1 million 2022 brought both new events and returning favorites to Busch Gardens Tampa Bay. Celebrations like Cinco de Mayo and Viva La Música took place for the first time, while Mardi Gras, the Food & Wine Festival, and the Real Music concert series returned to the park that year. Busch Gardens also drew crowds to a new ride in March 2022: Iron Gwazi, the tallest hybrid roller coaster in North America. Notably, Busch Gardens' parent company, SeaWorld, reported increased revenue in 2022 compared to 2019, indicating that while there might be fewer visitors, those visitors are happy to spend more money on their experiences. - Location: Lake Buena Vista, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 27% - 2022 attendance: 10.9 million Between 2021 and 2022, Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World didn't have many new attractions to offer visitors. But that didn't stop over a million more attendees from streaming into the park in 2022, as pandemic restrictions continued to lift and Disney celebrated its 50th anniversary. Disney theme parks did roll out the Genie+ line-skipping service starting in 2021, which could have helped increase attendance at Hollywood Studios and other Walt Disney World attractions. - Location: Lake Buena Vista, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 29% - 2022 attendance: 10.0 million Several hugely popular events made their regularly scheduled returns to Epcot at Walt Disney World in 2022, including the Festival of the Arts, which features the Disney on Broadway Concert series. In the summer, Epcot also launched The Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind, a ride that ranks as one of the world's longest enclosed coasters. Last but not least, the fast-casual restaurant Connections Café and Eatery serving up Starbucks favorites opened its doors for the first time in 2022, a major plus for visitors needing a caffeine boost. - Location: Lake Buena Vista, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 35% - 2022 attendance: 17.1 million There's good news and bad news for Magic Kingdom fans. This was the most-visited theme park in the world in 2022, but these visitor stats don't even come close to pre-pandemic numbers, which reached 21 million in 2019. The park also experienced significant construction delays on one of its most anticipated rides, Tron Lightcycle/Run, which was originally slated to open in 2022 but was pushed to 2023. - Location: Orlando, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 46% - 2022 attendance: 4.5 million Just like its West Coast location, SeaWorld Orlando welcomed visitors to a brand-new roller coaster in 2022. The Ice Breaker features four different launches (forward and reverse, in case you were wondering) and the steepest beyond vertical drop in Florida, clocking in at 93 feet tall. Aside from the Ice Breaker, several key attractions, like the Kraken, were updated and given facelifts. The Electric Ocean summertime event also returned to dazzle audiences with two new shows: stunt show Adrenaline and luminescent percussion concert Electroblast. - Location: Universal City, California - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 53% - 2022 attendance: 8.4 million Universal Studios Hollywood made some major moves in 2022, namely opening a new film set, Jupiter's Claim, the Western-themed attraction at the center of the horror film \"Nope.\" Guests can explore Jupiter's Claim and other sets aboard the studio tour, which takes visitors behind the scenes of famous Universal releases. The park's ultra-popular Christmas event, The Awesomest Celebration of the Season, also made a triumphant comeback that year.

Several long-missed celebrations, including the Lunar New Year and the Food & Wine Festival, also returned to Disney California Adventure Park. Plus, the character of Raya from the 2021 animated film \"Raya and the Last Dragon\" made her debut here in 2022. - Location: Anaheim, California - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 97% - 2022 attendance: 16.9 million Attendance at Disneyland Park at Disneyland Resort nearly doubled between 2021 and 2022, likely due to the resort's post-pandemic reopening and those aforementioned discounted tickets. But also in 2022, the park's beloved nighttime shows (known as \"spectaculars\") finally kicked off again after the long hiatus. Displays like the Main Street Electrical Parade and Disneyland Forever illuminated the park after dark once more, heralding an eagerly anticipated return to normalcy for visitors. - Location: Maple, Ontario - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 524% - 2022 attendance: 3.8 million The largest theme park in Canada, Canada's Wonderland had a bumpy year in 2022, with one attraction catching fire and others trapping riders during a storm , but millions still entered the park in 2022, a dramatic increase from the prior year. Canada's Wonderland was especially busy in 2022—new events like the Taste of the Caribbean took place, and the water park attraction Mountain Bay Cliffs opened this year, as did the Lazy Bear Lodge restaurant.
