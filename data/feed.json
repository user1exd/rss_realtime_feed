Of all places, the YouTube streaming star bizarrely attended Gloucestershire’s annual cheese rolling competition, where participants race down the 200-yard-long Cooper’s Hill chasing a wheel of Double Gloucester cheese. In an before the race, Speed admitted that he was “nervous” but “here to win” — explaining he had even talked to a veteran of the competition beforehand who gave him some expert advice. Speed’s interview with BBC news for the annual cheese rolling event in Gloucestershire 😭 Without any prior ‘training’, the YouTuber lined up at the front alongside other participants. And when the race got off, it wasn’t long before Speed was tumbling down the hill. But, miraculously, managed to regain control of his fall and landed himself a fourth-place finish in the race. IShowSpeed placed 4th in the Gloucestershire Cheese Rolling 2024 competition However, in an the race, Speed claimed to have picked up a leg injury on the way down. The 19-year-old joked that he had to go to the hospital for treatment — though it seems he was just fooling the reporter. When asked if it was worth it in the end, he enthusiastically responded “hell yeah” — before adding that he’s up for giving the competition another shot next year. 🚨| WATCH: Speed got injured at the cheese rolling event but plans to try again next year 😂 “It looks scary, but once that first slide you’re like ‘you know what I can do this, I can take it’ and I took it,” he said. “I want to do it again because I know how to win now. I went fourth place my first time with no technique, with no videos. I did it though.” With over 24.8 million subscribers, Speed has quickly grown to become one of the biggest streamers in the world.

You need to find a designated campsite. This is a bit more challenging in the Highlands, as many of the You’ll also need to bring some extra warm clothes with you, seeing as the average lowland temperature is around 3-7°C [37.4-44.6 °F] in fall and spring and 0 °C [32 °F] in winter. While some campers are equipped with a heater or even heated beds, not all of them are, so having the appropriate attire is crucial. Lastly, you should keep in mind that not all campsites are open during the wintertime, and campsites are the only place you’re allowed to park your camper overnight in Iceland. For an overview of campsites open all year round, have a look at the map in the ‘Campsites in Iceland’ section. Above is a map of some of the most popular campsites in Iceland, some more secluded ones and ones that are open all year round. It was updated in 2024 and is not a full list of campsites in Iceland. At the same time, they give you added comfort compared to sleeping in a tent, and as mentioned above, they can potentially save you money on the accommodation front. Besides that, travelling in a camper means that the kids will have plenty of space to run around and play in when you set up camp. A lot of campsites in Iceland have playgrounds, areas for ball games and sometimes even mini-golf. Usually, they are also located close to swimming pools. That is to say, the kids will have plenty to do. Two particularly fun and popular campsites for families are Related Posts © 2024 - Iceland Review ehf. All rights reserved.",

        "content": "As we embarked on our journey, camaraderie filled the air. While travelling alongside fellow prospective corps members, the sense of unity was palpable. From shared laughter to prayers for safe travels, each moment cemented the bonds of camaraderie that NYSC fosters. My journey was interesting, especially travelling with a friend also assigned to the same state. “Corpers on board” was boldly written on our vehicle, and people we passed hailed and prayed for our safe journey. Upon graduating from the university, I eagerly anticipated joining the mandatory one year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). I shared my excitement with friends, but not all of them were keen to join immediately. One friend said he needed to hustle and build his career first. However, I wanted to get it done quickly and move on to the next phase of my life. So, I registered and subsequently got mobilised for a three-week-long camping/orientation. Embarking on the journey to join the NYSC is more than just a transition to adulthood; it is a rollercoaster ride filled with unexpected twists and turns. The call up letter came and its stated that I am to camp at the Paiko camp in Paikoro Local Government Area of Niger state, but that after the three weeks, I am to complete my service in Abuja. I was happy and prepared to travel, as I had never been to Niger State. I learnt that it is one of the largest states in terms of land mass. I thought about how beneficial it would be for the Federal Government to collaborate with the NYSC, and invest in agriculture to empower graduates, so as to develop their future. This would surely boost the economy at both the federal and state levels. NYSC is a mandatory scheme for all graduates except those over thirty years old, who are usually issued with an exemption letter. The night before departure, a subtle warning on the NYSC documentation reminded us not to travel at night — a precaution that resonated deeply. Despite the allure of reaching our destination quickly, we chose safety over haste, breaking our journey when dusk fell. This lesson is applicable beyond NYSC, reminding us that even in seemingly safe spaces, vigilance is key. As we embarked on our journey, camaraderie filled the air. While travelling alongside fellow prospective corps members, the sense of unity was palpable. From shared laughter to prayers for safe travels, each moment cemented the bonds of camaraderie that NYSC fosters. My journey was interesting, especially travelling with a friend also assigned to the same state. “Corpers on board” was boldly written on our vehicle, and people we passed hailed and prayed for our safe journey. We chatted and played music, making the journey memorable. Yet, amidst the laughter and anticipation, a moment of stark reality halted us in our tracks. In the midst of lush landscapes, armed men appeared — a stark reminder of the world’s unpredictability. It was a wake-up call, underscoring the importance of vigilance, even in seemingly serene surroundings. We stopped at a canteen to eat a sumptuous meal, enjoying the privileges of being a corper. Continuing our journey, we enjoyed the natural beauty of Nigeria’s landscapes.

Security checkpoints manned by dedicated officers reassured us of their commitment to our safety. Their professionalism and integrity stood as beacons of hope on an otherwise uncertain journey. The most unexpected twist came when a seemingly menacing encounter turned into a moment of levity. Startled awake by a tap on the shoulder, I found myself face-to-face with an armed security officer, his stern demeanour giving way to a shared joke. In that moment, fear melted into laughter, reminding me that amidst life’s uncertainties, moments of joy abound. As we finally arrived at our destination, the journey left an indelible mark. From cautionary tales to unexpected camaraderie, each moment was a testament to the importance of preparation and vigilance. As I shared my tale with my hustling friend, who had chosen a different path, I couldn’t help but wonder what adventures awaited him. For in the journey of NYSC, every twist and turn is a chapter waiting to be written, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the bonds that unite us all. This is the essence of NYSC, preaching national unity and peace. Apart from the interesting aspects of NYSC, there are numerous advantages that I believe will convince you to join the programme. If you want to know the funny joke the officer cracked with me, I guess you should also prepare to go for your NYSC, so you can experience how interesting and memorable the journey was. As long as we take the necessary security precautions and avoid rough driving, NYSC ensures our safety because we are all dear to the government.

        "content": "A new parliament convened in Iran’s capital Tehran for the first time on Monday, days after a deadly helicopter crash which killed the country’s president and foreign minister. Local media reported that lawmakers in the Islamic Consultative Assembly opened the first session of the legislative period with a recitation from the Koran. A new parliamentary speaker is set to be elected in the coming days. Incumbent Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, is running for re-election against religious hardliner Mojtaba Zonnour and former foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki. Elections in Iran are widely seen as neither free nor fair, as the country’s Guardian Council, a supervisory body of Islamic clerics and lawyers, must approve all candidates before they can run. Hardliners won this year’s parliamentary elections, which were held over two rounds in March and May amid a historically low turnout of around 40 per cent. Many Iranian citizens have become disillusioned in the face of political repression, an economic crisis and failed attempts to reform the country’s political system. A wave of protests in September 2022 following the death of a young Kurdish woman, Masha Amini, was violently suppressed by authorities. Political power in Iran is concentrated in the hands of the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iran’s president Ebrahim Raisi and foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian died in a helicopter crash near the border to Azerbaijan more than a week ago. According to media reports, more than three million people attended Raisi’s funeral in the north-eastern city of Mashhad on Thursday after days of national mourning. (dpa/NAN)",

        "description": "The SNP leader was campaigning in Dumfries, part of the Dumfries and Galloway constituency won by Scottish Secretary Alister Jack in 2019.",
        "content": "Mr Swinney, who took over as SNP leader from Humza Yousaf just three weeks ago, said the party was already united behind him and was “very focused on the election campaign”. However, polls have shown the party, which for years has been the dominant force in Scottish politics, is now trailing behind Labour in the run-up to the July 4 voting day. Most recently, a poll by More In Common put support for Labour on 35%, five points ahead of the SNP. Mr Swinney insisted the SNP was “focused on the election as a united party”, adding this was a “significant achievement” which had come about in the “very short space of time” since he took charge. Speaking to journalists as he campaigned in Dumfries, Mr Swinney said: “I want to make sure we take our message to every part of the country to reclaim the ground the opinion polls indicate we have got to reclaim to be successful. “The election is the best part of six weeks away and we have got a lot of ground to cover to do that.” Asked if that meant the SNP was now fighting this election as the “underdog”, the Scottish First Minister said: “That’s an interesting way to put it. “Actually, it is quite a good way to fight an election campaign, if I think back to the contest in 2017 in my own local area, Perth and North Perthshire.” Mr Swinney said in that general election it had been thought the SNP could lose that seat, but he noted: “We fought it as the underdog and we won. So, I think there is maybe something in that.” The SNP leader was campaigning in the Dumfries and Galloway seat currently held by Scottish Secretary Alister Jack. Mr Swinney said the Tory cabinet secretary, along with other Scottish Conservative MPs, had “presided over austerity, Brexit and the cost-of-living crisis being inflicted on Scotland” – adding that voters were “angry” about this. He told people living in those seats held by the Tories in Scotland: “If you want to do something about it, then you vote SNP, because we are the challenger to the Conservatives in these constituencies, and we can remove those Conservative MPs with SNP votes. “My message to voters in this part of the country and in other areas where the Conservatives represent the area is to vote SNP to remove the Tories.”",

        "content": "Dylan Minnette, who rose to fame following his role in 13 Reasons Why, revealed the reason behind taking a break from acting. In a recent interview, he said that he left acting as he decided to focus on music with his rock band Wallows, Variety reported. The 13 Reasons Why star began his acting career as a child star at the age of 8 and touched the new heights of fame after playing Clay Jensen in the popular series. “I was fortunate to find success in [acting],” said Dylan Minnette. “I was on 13 Reasons Why and it was really popular and definitely reached a peak in what I’ve had in acting. But it also started to feel like a bit of a job. And I was in a very fortunate position, it was always fun for me, always really inspiring, but then it was just starting to feel like just a job.” According to the actor, he along with his other band members had dreamed of taking music “all the way as far as we can.” Read more: ‘I must not do any more dramas or films...’: Momina Iqbal is quitting showbiz? “The only way that’s gonna happen is if I put my 100% time and energy into it and take it very seriously and show the world that we all take this very seriously. This is a real band, we’re going to do real band things,” he said. However, the 13 Reasons Why actor said that he does thinks about returning to the screen on occasions. He planned to make a return to acting last year, however, he could not do it due to the actors strike. Minnette’s last outing was in 2022’s Scream and The Dropout and has since remained out of the spotlight.",

        "content": "The National Counter Terrorism Centre (NCTC) has embarked on the second round of public participation on the revised National Strategy to Counter Violent Extremism (NSCVE). Last November, NCTC launched a comprehensive nationwide exercise to gather insights and feedback from a broad spectrum of stakeholders including community leaders, civil society organizations, security experts and the general public. The exercise aimed to assess the effectiveness of the current strategy that has been in place for the last seven years and to incorporate valuable perspectives. Joseph Mureithi NCTC Official said the initial phase of consultations yielded significant input, informing the development of a draft document that seeks to address emerging threats, incorporate good practices and strengthen our collective resilience against violent extremism. The second round of public participation is designed to present the draft document to the public for inputs, solicit feedback and to foster engagement. NCTC today held a public participation with security teams and stakeholders from Mombasa, Kwale, Taita-Taveta, Kilifi, Lamu and Kwale counties. “We are here to engage the public and our partners about the ongoing review process for the NSCVE. It is part of the constitutional requirement to get public views,” said Mureithi in Mombasa. “We had a strategy that has taken us through from 2016. It has come to a time to build on the lessons learnt, we need also to build on what we have achieved and improve on the ways we deal with Violent Extremism as a country,” he added. Mureithi noted that through the 2016 strategy they have been working in a collaborative and multi-agency set up and were able to reduce cases of VE in the country. The new strategy will make the country safer. The reviewed NSCVE has been established to address issues related to gender, youth, inclusion and the need for male mentorship, the strategy is now anchored in the Constitution, Law and Policy. The approach to monitoring & evaluation has been improved by providing clear outcomes that will serve as the units of measure for impact. The strategy has reorganized the pillars into working groups, transforming them from coordination mechanisms into delivery units. Each working group will mobilize local actors and have clear outputs aligned with intended outcomes. It provides further clarity on violent extremism as defined by Prevention of Terrorism Act 2012, distinguishing it from other forms of crime. The strategy also addresses the issues of resourcing and sustainability. “We have been working on building trust between the citizens and the security. We have been cooperating well. The fight against terrorism relies on the cooperation between security agencies and the public. We continue to encourage the strengthening of cooperation,” said Mureithi. The terrorism menace, he added, is not a government issue but a societal problem that needs the participation of all the people. Mombasa County Commissioner Mohamed Noor urged residents to give views to improve the draft strategy to solve CVE challenges.",

Akhil, a native of Neyyattinkara, was injured in the accident that took place in Varkala. It is reported that the youngster was hit by the Bengaluru Express heading towards Bengaluru from Kanyakumari. The teen was seriously injured in the tragedy and is now under treatment at Taluk Hospital Varkala. In another news, it was reported that a robbery was carried out by spraying chilli powder in Varkala. The chilli powder was sprayed on the eyes of an elder woman and her necklace was stolen in the incident. Omana (60), a native of Varkala Panthuvila faced the attack at 5:45 am on Monday. Omana was in the washroom outside her house in the early morning hours, when the culprit ambushed her with the chill powder. The man was wearing a mask to veil his face and Omana screamed in fear. The other members couldn't come out of the house as the culprit had already tampered with the lock of the main door. At this time, he snatched away the gold necklace from the woman’s neck and fled away.",

        "description": "The Republican National Convention in July is but one of the attractions drawing visitors to Wisconsin's largest city, where there's more than beer and cheese.",
        "content": "You might say Wisconsin’s largest city is having a moment. But that’s probably not accurate as it’s surely more than just a moment. Milwaukee, with a population of about 560,000, is a big enough city to have world-class attractions but small enough to make it easy to get around. It’s currently in the spotlight for a host of reasons. The big news is the Republican National Convention, which will be held in Milwaukee July 15-18, bringing an estimated 50,000 visitors, including international journalists for the four-day event. Shortly before the RNC, the city’s annual three-weekend music extravaganza, Summerfest, is likely to draw more than 600,000 to the Lake Michigan shore. And the week after the convention, 80,000 people are expected for Harley-Davidson’s annual Homecoming festival, July 25-28, with big-name entertainers. And then there’s the television show. Bravo’s reality series “Top Chef” was filmed in Milwaukee and other Wisconsin spots last year and began airing its 14 weekly episodes on March 20. Viewers get a big dose of Wisconsin landscapes, history and culture along with the food porn. Yes, this city on the shores of Lake Michigan is getting a lot of attention. Here are some of the reasons why, and ideas that might draw you to visit before, during or after these big events. Beer Long known as Brew City (that German influence), 27 breweries operate in Milwaukee. That compares with more than 40 breweries tapping kegs back in the 1860s. Of those 40, four are still around: Blatz, Pabst, Miller and Schlitz, once the largest beer producer in the U.S. and known as “the beer that made Milwaukee famous.” Hanging out at Lakefront Brewery, especially after a stroll along the Milwaukee RiverWalk, is a great way to spend some time. Sample the gold-medal winning RiverWest Stein, an amber lager, alongside some tasty fried cheese curds. Head to 3rd Street Market Hall to check out City Fountain, a self-serve indoor beer garden where you can sample as much or as little as you like of some of Wisconsin’s best beer. You’re charged by the ounce. There are all kinds of beer tours available in Milwaukee and its surrounding areas. Find the one that’s right for you at visitmilwaukee.org . And if visiting breweries and taverns isn’t enough to get your beer fix, consider this: the Brewhouse Inn and Suites is a 90-room boutique hotel constructed on the site of the historic Pabst brewery. The rooms are arranged around a central courtyard housing huge copper brewing kettles. History Milwaukee’s history is alive and on full display in so many ways. When European immigrants began arriving in the United States in large numbers after 1850, Milwaukee was the destination for Germans. Today, the city’s brewing industry, its tradition of ethnic festivals and a few Gilded Age mansions are part of that German tradition that visitors can explore. It was in the 1890s that teenager William Harley met Arthur Davidson in a Milwaukee neighborhood. Shortly after the turn of the century, they produced the first Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Today, that history is examined at one of the city’s biggest tourist destinations, the Harley-Davidson Museum . It’s a 20-acre complex with retail stores, restaurants and two floors of memorabilia. A more traditional history tour is at the Pabst Mansion , where programs help tell the history of brewing, art and architecture of the time with the impressive Gilded Age mansion from which Frederick Pabst ran the brewery. Food For so long, Milwaukee has been famous for brats, cheese and frozen custard. That’s still true, and make sure to sample some of those stomach pleasers. (Leon’s is my favorite for custard.) But there’s much more to the Milwaukee food scene, which is getting lots of attention thanks in part to “Top Chef.” Do your own research to find what tempts you most, but here are a few restaurants I recommend for can’t-miss dining experiences. DanDan, described as American-Chinese cuisine, is helmed by “Top Chef” contestant Dan Jacobs. His Happy Chicken is a dish to remember, spicy, crispy and flavorful. I would go back just for that. At Birch, the farm-to-table menu from chef Kyle Knall drew the attention of the New York Times, ranking it one of the Top 50 restaurants in the U.S. in 2023. The ember-roasted walleye, wood-roasted pork chop and ricotta-filled pasta are standouts. The Diplomat, a cozy neighborhood spot where chef Dane Baldwin claimed a James Beard Award in 2022, offers approachable, shareable plates. Outstanding ingredients and interesting combinations elevate simple dishes. The Knife & Fork Chicken and the Diplomac prime beef burger are popular choices. Art Milwaukee is not shy in the outdoor mural category, but what might make it different from other cities is that many pieces focus on beer and sports. For architecture fans, a visit to Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block is a must. It’s the renowned architect’s collection of affordable housing units and is open to the public on most Saturdays. Tours often sell out, so plan in advance . But the indisputable star in this category is the Milwaukee Art Museum , known as much for its collections and exhibits as for its architecture. Designed by famed Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the main building perches next to Lake Michigan like a bird, or a boat, or a sail, and has become a city landmark. Four floors with more than 40 galleries display a broad collection with pieces ranging from ancient decorative arts to Renaissance paintings and documentary photography. There’s also a large collection of works from German artists. Outdoor recreation Though Milwaukee has the amenities of a big city, outdoor recreation is also plentiful. During summer, Bradford Beach is a popular destination. It’s a wide, sandy expanse along Lake Michigan where volleyball leagues share the sand with sunbathers. It’s just a short drive from downtown. There’s 135 miles of paved trails looping around Milwaukee County. Check out the 2-mile Seven Bridges Trail in nearby South Milwaukee. It crosses bridges and stairways built by the Works Progress Administration almost 100 years ago through ravines along Lannon stone paths. Veterans Park, also along the lakefront, is a destination for kite flyers, kayakers and standup paddle boarders. There’s a kite store on site and a company that rents kayaks and standup paddle boards. Those water activities are also available on the city’s rivers. Sports and festivals Milwaukee is a huge sports town and in summer a trip to American Family Field to watch the Brewers play baseball is a must. New this year at the field is an annex of the 3rd Street Market Hall. So along with your brats and beer, you can nosh on empanadas and crab Rangoon while watching the game and the sausage mascot races at the bottom of the sixth inning. Milwaukee is known as the city of festivals with nearly 100 on the calendar for events in and around the city. Many celebrate the cultures of the immigrants who shaped the city. Others celebrate food and art. There’s even the Weird Fest, which seems to be mostly about beer, so that’s not really too weird for Milwaukee. Terri Colby is a freelancer.",

But there’s much more to the Milwaukee food scene, which is getting lots of attention thanks in part to “Top Chef.” Do your own research to find what tempts you most, but here are a few restaurants I recommend for can’t-miss dining experiences. DanDan, described as American-Chinese cuisine, is helmed by “Top Chef” contestant Dan Jacobs. His Happy Chicken is a dish to remember, spicy, crispy and flavorful. I would go back just for that. At Birch, the farm-to-table menu from chef Kyle Knall drew the attention of the New York Times, ranking it one of the Top 50 restaurants in the U.S. in 2023. The ember-roasted walleye, wood-roasted pork chop and ricotta-filled pasta are standouts. The Diplomat, a cozy neighborhood spot where chef Dane Baldwin claimed a James Beard Award in 2022, offers approachable, shareable plates. Outstanding ingredients and interesting combinations elevate simple dishes. The Knife & Fork Chicken and the Diplomac prime beef burger are popular choices. Milwaukee is not shy in the outdoor mural category, but what might make it different from other cities is that many pieces focus on beer and sports. For architecture fans, a visit to Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block is a must. It’s the renowned architect’s collection of affordable housing units and is open to the public on most Saturdays. Tours often sell out, so . But the indisputable star in this category is the , known as much for its collections and exhibits as for its architecture. Designed by famed Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the main building perches next to Lake Michigan like a bird, or a boat, or a sail, and has become a city landmark. Four floors with more than 40 galleries display a broad collection with pieces ranging from ancient decorative arts to Renaissance paintings and documentary photography. There’s also a large collection of works from German artists. Though Milwaukee has the amenities of a big city, outdoor recreation is also plentiful. During summer, Bradford Beach is a popular destination. It’s a wide, sandy expanse along Lake Michigan where volleyball leagues share the sand with sunbathers. It’s just a short drive from downtown. There’s 135 miles of paved trails looping around Milwaukee County. Check out the 2-mile Seven Bridges Trail in nearby South Milwaukee. It crosses bridges and stairways built by the Works Progress Administration almost 100 years ago through ravines along Lannon stone paths. Veterans Park, also along the lakefront, is a destination for kite flyers, kayakers and standup paddle boarders. There’s a kite store on site and a company that rents kayaks and standup paddle boards. Those water activities are also available on the city’s rivers. Milwaukee is a huge sports town and in summer a trip to American Family Field to watch the Brewers play baseball is a must. New this year at the field is an annex of the 3rd Street Market Hall. So along with your brats and beer, you can nosh on empanadas and crab Rangoon while watching the game and the sausage mascot races at the bottom of the sixth inning. Milwaukee is known as the city of festivals with nearly 100 on the calendar for events in and around the city. Many celebrate the cultures of the immigrants who shaped the city. Others celebrate food and art. There’s even the Weird Fest, which seems to be mostly about beer, so that’s not really too weird for Milwaukee.",

        "description": "The Republican National Convention in July is but one of the attractions drawing visitors to Wisconsin's largest city, where there's more than beer and cheese.",
        "content": "You might say Wisconsin’s largest city is having a moment. But that’s probably not accurate as it’s surely more than just a moment. Milwaukee, with a population of about 560,000, is a big enough city to have world-class attractions but small enough to make it easy to get around. It’s currently in the spotlight for a host of reasons. The big news is the Republican National Convention, which will be held in Milwaukee July 15-18, bringing an estimated 50,000 visitors, including international journalists for the four-day event. Shortly before the RNC, the city’s annual three-weekend music extravaganza, Summerfest, is likely to draw more than 600,000 to the Lake Michigan shore. And the week after the convention, 80,000 people are expected for Harley-Davidson’s annual Homecoming festival, July 25-28, with big-name entertainers. And then there’s the television show. Bravo’s reality series “Top Chef” was filmed in Milwaukee and other Wisconsin spots last year and began airing its 14 weekly episodes on March 20. Viewers get a big dose of Wisconsin landscapes, history and culture along with the food porn. Yes, this city on the shores of Lake Michigan is getting a lot of attention. Here are some of the reasons why, and ideas that might draw you to visit before, during or after these big events. Long known as Brew City (that German influence), 27 breweries operate in Milwaukee. That compares with more than 40 breweries tapping kegs back in the 1860s. Of those 40, four are still around: Blatz, Pabst, Miller and Schlitz, once the largest beer producer in the U.S. and known as “the beer that made Milwaukee famous.” Hanging out at Lakefront Brewery, especially after a stroll along the Milwaukee RiverWalk, is a great way to spend some time. Sample the gold-medal winning RiverWest Stein, an amber lager, alongside some tasty fried cheese curds. Head to 3rd Street Market Hall to check out City Fountain, a self-serve indoor beer garden where you can sample as much or as little as you like of some of Wisconsin’s best beer. You’re charged by the ounce. There are all kinds of beer tours available in Milwaukee and its surrounding areas. Find the one that’s right for you at visitmilwaukee.org . And if visiting breweries and taverns isn’t enough to get your beer fix, consider this: the Brewhouse Inn and Suites is a 90-room boutique hotel constructed on the site of the historic Pabst brewery. The rooms are arranged around a central courtyard housing huge copper brewing kettles. Milwaukee’s history is alive and on full display in so many ways. When European immigrants began arriving in the United States in large numbers after 1850, Milwaukee was the destination for Germans. Today, the city’s brewing industry, its tradition of ethnic festivals and a few Gilded Age mansions are part of that German tradition that visitors can explore. It was in the 1890s that teenager William Harley met Arthur Davidson in a Milwaukee neighborhood. Shortly after the turn of the century, they produced the first Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Today, that history is examined at one of the city’s biggest tourist destinations, the Harley-Davidson Museum . It’s a 20-acre complex with retail stores, restaurants and two floors of memorabilia. A more traditional history tour is at the Pabst Mansion , where programs help tell the history of brewing, art and architecture of the time with the impressive Gilded Age mansion from which Frederick Pabst ran the brewery.

        "description": "The resolution he explained, had paved the way for the return of Emirates Airlines to Nigerian skies.The post Nigeria, Saudi Arabia To Resume Cargo Flights- Keyamo appeared first on Channels Television.",
        "content": "The Minister of Aviation, Festus Keyamo, has hinted at plans for the resumption of cargo flights between Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. Keyamo while reeling out the achievements of the aviation sector at the 3rd ministerial updates on Monday in Abuja, said the feat would be achieved through collaboration with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). According to Keyamo, the decision was finalised during a recent visit to Saudi Arabia, where he met with his counterpart. “I have good news for you from Saudi Arabia. I met my counterpart in Saudi Arabia and we have agreed to resume cargo flights,” Keyamo stated. He highlighted that these flights had been suspended for an extended period but with the new agreement, cargo services would be restored to boost trade and logistical connections between the two nations. Keyamo also addressed another critical issue on Monday concerning the clearance of foreign airlines’ funds trapped in Nigeria. Keyamo added that the Federal Government has also ensured the clearance of a longstanding backlog of trapped funds for foreign airlines hence the return of Emirates Airlines to Nigerian skies. This, he noted, has positively impacted the financial stability of the aviation industry. Emirates announced on May 16, 2024, its plans to recommence flights to Nigerian airports starting from October 1, 2024, after a long break from Nigeria. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had in January said the Federal Government had “concluded the payment of all verified claims’’ by foreign airlines with the payment of an additional $64.44m to concerned airlines. The development had brought the total verified amount paid to the air transport sector to $136.73m, adding that “all the verified airline claims had now been cleared.”",

        "content": "Early introduction of peanuts in infants leads to a 71% reduction in adolescent peanut allergy risk, a groundbreaking study reveals. Introducing peanuts into infants’ diets from as early as four months has been shown to significantly reduce the likelihood of developing a peanut allergy in adolescence, a long-term study from King’s College London reveals. The study confirms that early and regular peanut consumption lowers the risk of allergy by 71% compared to avoidance. Feeding children peanuts regularly from infancy to age five reduced the rate of peanut allergy in adolescence by 71%, even after many years when the children ate or avoided peanuts as desired. The new findings provide conclusive evidence that introducing peanuts into babies’ diets early will achieve long-term prevention of peanut allergy. Importance of Early Introduction Lead investigator Professor Gideon Lack from King’s College London said: “Decades of advice to avoid peanuts has made parents fearful of introducing peanuts at an early age. The evidence is clear that the early introduction of peanuts in infancy induces long-term tolerance and protects children from allergies well into adolescence. This simple intervention will make a remarkable difference to future generations and see peanut allergies plummet.” LEAP-Trio Trial Findings Results from the LEAP-Trio trial are published today (May 27) in the NEJM Evidence by researchers from King’s College London and sponsored and co-funded by the US National Institutes of Health ’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Peanut allergy is rising in Western countries. The prevalence of peanut allergy is about 2% in young children in North America, UK, Western Europe, and Australia. For some, even small amounts of peanuts can lead to a life-threatening allergic reaction. This, as well as conflicting advice, has made parents and caregivers fearful of introducing peanuts into diets. Building on Previous Research The new research findings come from the LEAP-Trio study, building on the results of the Learning Early About Peanut Allergy (LEAP) clinical trial. In the first trial, half of the participants were asked to regularly consume peanuts from infancy until age 5 years, while the other half were asked to avoid peanuts during that period. Researchers found that early introduction of peanuts reduced the risk of peanut allergy at age 5 by 81%. Long-Term Follow-Up Results The investigators followed up both groups from age 6 to age 12 or older. In that period, children could choose to eat peanuts in whatever amount and frequency they wanted. They found that 15.4% of participants from the early childhood peanut-avoidance group and 4.4% from the early childhood peanut-consumption group had peanut allergy at age 12 or older. These results show that regular, early peanut consumption reduce the risk of peanut allergy in adolescence by 71% compared to early peanut avoidance. Implementation of Early Peanut Introduction Professor George Du Toit, Co-Lead Investigator from King’s College London said: “This is a safe and highly effective intervention which can be implemented as early as 4 months of age. The infant needs to be developmentally ready to start weaning and peanuts should be introduced as a soft pureed paste or as peanut puffs.” Study Methodology and Implications The researchers also found that although participants in the LEAP peanut-consumption group ate more peanuts throughout childhood than the other participants overall, the frequency and amount of peanuts consumed varied widely in both groups and included periods of not eating peanuts. This shows that the protective effect of early peanut consumption lasts without the need to consistently eat peanut products throughout childhood and early adolescence. The LEAP-Trio study team tested the adolescents for peanut allergy primarily through an oral food challenge. This involved giving participants gradually increasing amounts of peanuts in a carefully controlled setting to determine if they could safely consume at least 5 grams of peanuts, the equivalent of more than 20 peanuts. The study team also surveyed participants about their recent patterns of peanut consumption and verified the self-reports through measurements of peanuts in dust from participants’ beds, a technique previously validated by LEAP investigators. Professor Lack, who is the Head of the Children’s Allergy Service at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, added: “Early consumption of peanuts will prevent more than 100,000 new cases of peanut allergy every year worldwide.” Reference: 27 May 2024, NEJM Evidence .",

        "description": "The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas.",
        "content": "VALLEY VIEW, Texas — Powerful storms killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas. On Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early Monday in a post on social media platform X, citing “multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes.” Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference Sunday. The dead included two children, ages 2 and 5. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff. Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity. The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county’s emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. In Kentucky, a man was killed Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed on social media that it was a storm-related death. Beshear said Monday that an additional two people had been killed in his state. In Texas, about 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, Abbott said, sitting in front of a ravaged truck stop near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest hit, with winds reaching an estimated 135 mph, officials said. “The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,” said Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts of severe weather, including storms that killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. Abbot signed an amended severe weather disaster declaration on Sunday to include Denton, Montague, Cooke and Collin on a list of counties already under a disaster declaration sparked by storms and flooding in late April. Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot. “A firefighter came to check on us and he said, ‘You’re very lucky,’” Parra said. “The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.\" Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas. The destruction continued a grim month of deadly severe weather in the nation's midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Meteorologists and authorities issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region late Saturday and into Sunday. “If you are in the path of this storm take cover now!” the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma, posted on X. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. Residents awoke Sunday to overturned cars and collapsed garages. Some residents could be seen pacing and assessing the damage. Nearby, neighbors sat on the foundation of a wrecked home. In Valley View, near the truck stop, the storms ripped the roofs off homes and blew out windows. Clothing, insulation, bits of plastic and other pieces of debris were wrapped around miles of barbed wire fence line surrounding grazing land in the rural area. Kevin Dorantes, 20, was in nearby Carrollton when he learned the tornado was bearing down on the Valley View neighborhood where he lived with his father and brother. He called the two of them and told them to take cover in the windowless bathroom, where they rode out the storm and survived unharmed. As Dorantes wandered through the neighborhood of downed power lines and devastated houses, he came upon a family whose home was reduced to a pile of splintered rubble. A father and son were trapped under debris and friends and neighbors raced to get them out, Dorantes said. “They were conscious but severely injured,” Dorantes said. As tornado season approaches, more residents in vulnerable regions are turning to private shelters to ensure their safety. These shelters have become a critical lifeline, especially in areas prone to severe weather. Craig Ceecee, a meteorologist from Mississippi, emphasizes the importance of having a dedicated safe space during tornadoes. He notes that many people live in mobile homes or buildings without basements, which are particularly susceptible to damage. His website, findyourtornadoshelter.com , maps out public shelters, but awareness and accessibility remain issues. Advances in radar technology have improved tornado warning lead times, now averaging 13 minutes. Despite this, public shelters in rural may be miles away, making them impractical during an emergency. Private shelters, typically installed in garages or basements, offer immediate protection. While the costs of these shelters, including installation, can be significant, many see them as a necessary investment for their family's safety. The severe weather knocked out power for tens of thousands of homes and businesses in the path of the storms. On Monday, more than 187,000 customers were without power in Kentucky, according to the tracking website poweroutage.us . Some 84,000 customers were without power in Alabama; 74,000, West Virginia; 70,000, Missouri; and 63,000, Arkansas. Inaccessible roads and downed power lines in Oklahoma also led officials in the town of Claremore, near Tulsa, to announce on social media that the city was “shut down” due to the damage. The system causing the latest severe weather was expected to move east over the rest of the holiday weekend. The Indianapolis 500 started four hours late after a strong storm pushed into the area, forcing Indianapolis Motor Speedway officials to evacuate about 125,000 race fans. More severe storms were predicted in Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee. The risk of severe weather moves into North Carolina and Virginia on Monday, forecasters said.

        "description": "Emergency family shelters will cost the county $34 million this year, part of a nearly $200 million homelessness prevention and housing stability effort.",
        "content": "Imani Swinney moved to Minneapolis last year at the urging of her mother, who told her that the resources available in the city gave her a better shot at getting back on her feet. Swinney and her two young daughters were \"couch hopping,\" living with family and friends in North Carolina, when she decided to make the cross-country move to start over. At first, they lived with Swinney's mom and friends. But last summer, they ended up in an emergency shelter for homeless families funded by Hennepin County at the Holiday Inn in Bloomington. Once there, Swinney was surprised at how quickly county social workers helped her find income and food assistance. By fall, the family moved into a new apartment, and in the following months, Swinney got her driver's license back, bought a car, finished school and landed a job. \"You've got them by a landslide,\" Swinney said of the help available to families in Minnesota compared with some other states. In recent years, Hennepin County has helped hundreds of families like Swinney's escape homelessness and find stable housing. County leaders say this is one of the last places in the U.S. that promises to house all families with children — no matter the cost. David Hewitt, human services director for housing stability, said he summarizes the policy enacted in 2005 as \"no child sleeps outside.\" County leaders acknowledge that people from other parts of Minnesota, other states and outside the U.S. have come to Hennepin County because of the strong safety net. Still, county officials don't want to be the homeless shelter for other communities, so staffers work to determine which jurisdictions are financially responsible for those seeking help. That can be difficult, especially for people from other states or countries. County Commissioner Jeffrey Lunde said other communities may have \"quietly rolled up their 'All Are Welcome' flags and put them back in the garage\" but Hennepin County continues to provide shelter to everyone it can help. Keeping up with the demand has been increasingly challenging — and costly. The need for family shelter space surged after the eviction moratorium implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic ended in 2022 and filings reached record highs. A growing number of new arrivals from outside the U.S. further strained the system this winter, pushing occupancy rates of county shelters to 427% of their capacity. In February, more than half the families in the shelters were recent immigrants. To cover the growing costs, the County Board in March unanimously approved $9.6 million in additional spending, pushing the budget for family shelters to $34 million for 2024. In April, the board agreed to spend up to $9,000 a month for a \"safe space,\" which opened in December, that can serve as an overflow shelter when demand spikes. County leaders rely on a mix of local, state and federal dollars to pay their homelessness prevention efforts. They partner with cities like Minneapolis and local nonprofits like Catholic Charities or People Serving People to provide shelter and services. But funding for homeless shelters has typically fallen to local communities and charities. State support recently grew from $7 million to $22 million annually, but it still doesn't come close to meeting the demand. Hennepin County expects to spend $50 million on shelters this year; much of the money will come from local taxpayers. County officials focused a big part of federal pandemic aid on funding shelters, but that money will soon run out; officials anticipate a $13 million funding cliff in 2026. Nevertheless, commissioners have repeatedly emphasized their commitment to end chronic homelessness and improve residents' housing stability. They've successfully lobbied the state for new resources, such as more dedicated funding for shelters and rental assistance, as well as a new 0.25% sales tax for housing stability, which is expected to raise $29 million annually. \"A safe and affordable place to live is the foundation on which people build successful lives,\" County Board Chair Irene Fernando said in a statement. \"Hennepin County has a person-centered approach to providing housing, shelter and resources; our goal is to help everyone gain access to greater housing stability.\" It's not just the compassionate thing to do; it makes financial sense too, county officials said. People without shelter often end up in more costly places, like the emergency room or jail. \"All the stuff we can do to help people is much more effective if they have stable housing,\" Lunde said, noting that most people experiencing homelessness also need services for mental health, addiction and other challenges. Hennepin County's promise to shelter all families with children is just one part of Minnesota's largest homelessness prevention and housing stability program. The work has nearly $200 million in annual spending and a staff of 196 working to make homelessness rare, brief and nonrecurring, while investing in more affordable housing. One of those staffers is social worker Mario A. Daniel, who works primarily with homeless young adults. On an April afternoon, Daniel checked in with clients at YouthLink in Minneapolis, which has a drop-in center with necessities like hot meals, showers and laundry as well as places to meet with counselors and other social service providers. Daniel said a big part of his job is helping clients navigate the many barriers that keep them from stable housing. A missing identification card, bad credit or a poor rental history can shut them out if they don't know how to advocate for themselves. \"Everyone needs something different,\" Daniel said, but most importantly: \"They need to realize that they deserve to have housing.\" For instance, Daniel helped Swinney sign up for income and food assistance and pay off outstanding fines so she could regain her driver's license. He also helped her and her daughters get the essentials they needed for their new apartment. \"He's always on top of stuff,\" Swinney said. \"I'm so grateful for him.\"",

        "content": "VALLEY VIEW, Texas — Powerful storms killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas. On Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early Monday in a post on social media platform X, citing “multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes.” Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference Sunday. The dead included two children, ages 2 and 5. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff. Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity. The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county’s emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. Damage is seen after a storm the night before, Sunday, May 26, 2024, in Pryor, Okla. In Kentucky, a man was killed Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed on social media that it was a storm-related death. Beshear said Monday that an additional two people had been killed in his state. In Texas, about 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, Abbott said, sitting in front of a ravaged truck stop near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest hit, with winds reaching an estimated 135 mph, officials said. “The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,” said Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts of severe weather, including storms that killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. Abbot signed an amended severe weather disaster declaration on Sunday to include Denton, Montague, Cooke and Collin on a list of counties already under a disaster declaration sparked by storms and flooding in late April. A man looks at a damaged car after a tornado hit the day before, Sunday, May 26, 2024, in Valley View, Texas. Powerful storms left a wide trail of destruction Sunday across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where drivers took shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot. “A firefighter came to check on us and he said, ‘You’re very lucky,’” Parra said. “The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.\" Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas. The destruction continued a grim month of deadly severe weather in the nation's midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Meteorologists and authorities issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region late Saturday and into Sunday. “If you are in the path of this storm take cover now!” the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma, posted on X. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. Residents awoke Sunday to overturned cars and collapsed garages. Some residents could be seen pacing and assessing the damage. Nearby, neighbors sat on the foundation of a wrecked home. In Valley View, near the truck stop, the storms ripped the roofs off homes and blew out windows. Clothing, insulation, bits of plastic and other pieces of debris were wrapped around miles of barbed wire fence line surrounding grazing land in the rural area. Kevin Dorantes, 20, was in nearby Carrollton when he learned the tornado was bearing down on the Valley View neighborhood where he lived with his father and brother. He called the two of them and told them to take cover in the windowless bathroom, where they rode out the storm and survived unharmed. As Dorantes wandered through the neighborhood of downed power lines and devastated houses, he came upon a family whose home was reduced to a pile of splintered rubble. A father and son were trapped under debris and friends and neighbors raced to get them out, Dorantes said. “They were conscious but severely injured,” Dorantes said.

        "description": "County officials focus on making homelessness rare, brief and nonrecurring, while investing in affordable housing.",
        "content": "Hennepin County has the largest homelessness prevention and housing stability effort in Minnesota, working to shelter thousands of people each year and hopefully get them into permanent housing. The county has nearly 200 people working on homelessness and housing stability and will spend nearly $200 million in local, state and federal dollars in 2024. A new 0.25% sales tax approved by the Legislature will raise about $29 million annually for rental assistance and affordable housing. The county partners with cities and local nonprofits to provide shelter and other services to residents experiencing homelessness or housing instability. Hennepin County leaders say they are one of the last jurisdictions in the U.S. that promises to shelter all families with children so no child sleeps outside. \"We believe that homelessness is unacceptable and that government can do something about it,\" said David Hewitt, human services director for housing stability. \"This crisis is very visible. The successes are, almost by nature, invisible because it is people, in their homes, doing OK.\" The county's work has grown considerably since the coronavirus pandemic, when a combination of financial, health and social factors pushed many residents to the edge or over it. Last year, 9,000 people found shelter in the 13 year-round facilities the county funds. Other shelters come online in winter months when demand for space spikes. In 2023, county workers helped 2,171 people who were homeless transition into permanent housing. That was a 18% increase over 2022 and a 57% jump since 2021. County leaders focus on making homelessness rare, brief and nonrecurring; a popular approach with state and local governments across the U.S. Supplementing that work are ongoing investments to create and preserve affordable housing. Here's the focus of each of those efforts: Rare: With a staff of 31 and budget of $19 million, the aim of this team is to help residents keep the housing they have already. That means providing emergency rental assistance or connecting tenants facing eviction with lawyers for housing court. Staffers also help residents with unstable housing find temporary solutions so they don't have to go to a shelter. \"We are here to advocate for you,\" said Brittani Walker, a case management assistant. \"A lot of people are scared and don't know where to go.\" Brief: This team of 120 with a budget of $46 million works to get people who are living outside, in shelters or in unstable housing into a permanent place to live. Anyone who interacts with a county social worker at a shelter or an encampment can have their name and contact information entered into a database. A case worker will reach out to get them into permanent housing as quickly as possible. \"We work with people where they're at,\" said Phyllissha Butler, a supervisor for the youth homeless to housing team. She added that unhoused clients almost always face multiple challenges that contributed to why they lost their homes including mental health problems, substance abuse and financial challenges. \"We are looking to break down any barriers they have to housing,\" she said. Nonrecurring: A team of 18 with a budget of $103 million is focused on keeping people who have struggled with homelessness in permanent housing. Clients receive housing aid, which in February helped 2,300 households pay rent, and have a case worker who helps them avoid the problems that contributed to their housing instability. Nathan Nyren, a housing support program manager, said one of the biggest challenges is finding landlords who will rent to people who were homeless or have a criminal record. The housing aid is typically considered an ongoing income supplement, but sometimes the help is time limited. Nyren says providing rental assistance is cheaper than having homeless residents in shelters or ending up in the emergency room or jail. \"This program is saving taxpayers money,\" he said. \"Our goal is always to try to get people to be as independent as they can.\" Affordable housing: Hennepin County will invest about $23 million this year in affordable housing with plans to create about 1,000 new units. The staff of 27 works to maintain existing affordable housing and bring new units online through forgivable loans and other incentives for providers. There are also grants and assistance to help lower-income residents become homeowners. Hennepin County has a shortfall of more than 34,000 deeply affordable units for low-income residents. Nearly half of the county's tenants are cost-burdened by rent, according to the Minnesota Housing Partnership.",

        "description": "The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas.",
        "content": "VALLEY VIEW, Texas — Powerful storms killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas. On Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early Monday in a post on social media platform X, citing “multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes.” Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference Sunday. The dead included two children, ages 2 and 5. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff. Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity. The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county’s emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. In Kentucky, a man was killed Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed on social media that it was a storm-related death. Beshear said Monday that an additional two people had been killed in his state. In Texas, about 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, Abbott said, sitting in front of a ravaged truck stop near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest hit, with winds reaching an estimated 135 mph, officials said. “The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,” said Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts of severe weather, including storms that killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. Abbot signed an amended severe weather disaster declaration on Sunday to include Denton, Montague, Cooke and Collin on a list of counties already under a disaster declaration sparked by storms and flooding in late April. Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot. “A firefighter came to check on us and he said, ‘You’re very lucky,’” Parra said. “The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.\" Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas. The destruction continued a grim month of deadly severe weather in the nation's midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Meteorologists and authorities issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region late Saturday and into Sunday. “If you are in the path of this storm take cover now!” the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma, posted on X. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. Residents awoke Sunday to overturned cars and collapsed garages. Some residents could be seen pacing and assessing the damage. Nearby, neighbors sat on the foundation of a wrecked home. In Valley View, near the truck stop, the storms ripped the roofs off homes and blew out windows. Clothing, insulation, bits of plastic and other pieces of debris were wrapped around miles of barbed wire fence line surrounding grazing land in the rural area. Kevin Dorantes, 20, was in nearby Carrollton when he learned the tornado was bearing down on the Valley View neighborhood where he lived with his father and brother. He called the two of them and told them to take cover in the windowless bathroom, where they rode out the storm and survived unharmed. As Dorantes wandered through the neighborhood of downed power lines and devastated houses, he came upon a family whose home was reduced to a pile of splintered rubble. A father and son were trapped under debris and friends and neighbors raced to get them out, Dorantes said. “They were conscious but severely injured,” Dorantes said. As tornado season approaches, more residents in vulnerable regions are turning to private shelters to ensure their safety. These shelters have become a critical lifeline, especially in areas prone to severe weather. Craig Ceecee, a meteorologist from Mississippi, emphasizes the importance of having a dedicated safe space during tornadoes. He notes that many people live in mobile homes or buildings without basements, which are particularly susceptible to damage. His website, findyourtornadoshelter.com , maps out public shelters, but awareness and accessibility remain issues. Advances in radar technology have improved tornado warning lead times, now averaging 13 minutes. Despite this, public shelters in rural may be miles away, making them impractical during an emergency. Private shelters, typically installed in garages or basements, offer immediate protection. While the costs of these shelters, including installation, can be significant, many see them as a necessary investment for their family's safety. The severe weather knocked out power for tens of thousands of homes and businesses in the path of the storms. On Monday, more than 187,000 customers were without power in Kentucky, according to the tracking website poweroutage.us . Some 84,000 customers were without power in Alabama; 74,000, West Virginia; 70,000, Missouri; and 63,000, Arkansas. Inaccessible roads and downed power lines in Oklahoma also led officials in the town of Claremore, near Tulsa, to announce on social media that the city was “shut down” due to the damage. The system causing the latest severe weather was expected to move east over the rest of the holiday weekend. The Indianapolis 500 started four hours late after a strong storm pushed into the area, forcing Indianapolis Motor Speedway officials to evacuate about 125,000 race fans. More severe storms were predicted in Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee. The risk of severe weather moves into North Carolina and Virginia on Monday, forecasters said.

        "content": "The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes miss the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. say they are not represented accurately in the official numbers. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them versus how they identify themselves. The groups say money, political power and even health could be at stake. Being lumped into the wrong column can mean a gain or loss of government funds that are distributed based on data. For some, it's about their identity and feeling seen by their own country. The Office of Management and Budget said the working group that oversaw the revisions held 94 “listening sessions” with many advocacy groups, academics and the general public, and it will continue to reach out to communities. HMONG AND THE SECRET WAR During the Vietnam War and unbeknownst to the American public, the CIA recruited Lao and Hmong people to fight the spread of communism throughout Southeast Asia. Tens of thousands of Hmong soldiers died while others fled to the U.S. as a result of what became known as the “secret war.\" By the 1970s, many Hmong had resettled in Minnesota, Wisconsin and central California. Today, Hmong in the U.S. number more than 300,000. Some states recognize Hmong and Lao veterans with annual ceremonies, and in April, the Wisconsin governor signed a law mandating that Hmong American history be taught in schools. Given their history fighting in that region for the U.S., many Hmong feel strongly that they should be classified as Southeast Asian. But because China is considered the Hmong ancestral homeland, the U.S. Census Bureau categorized them as East Asian after the 2020 census. “That has been very hurtful to our elders and to our veterans who sacrificed so much to get us here to this country after everything they did to help the U.S. during the Vietnam War,” said May yer Thao, president and CEO of the St. Paul, Minnesota-based Hmong American Partnership. The East Asian label also pains them because the Hmong were oppressed in China as an ethnic minority and sought refuge in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, according to Quyên Dinh, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Southeast Asia Resource Action Center. Those who object to the classification also have a practical concern: the East Asian grouping could hide socioeconomic disparities between Hmong and other Asian households that need to be addressed. The per capita income of Hmong was almost $26,000, while it was more than $53,000 for Asians overall, according to the 2022 American Community Survey. “We are still one of the most impoverished communities in this nation,” Thao said. The Census Bureau says it’s working with the Hmong community to improve their classification. THE EXCLUDED BACKGROUNDS When the government revised its race and ethnicity standards in March — it's first major alteration since 1997 — its seven categories included a new one, Middle Eastern or North African, or MENA. The revisions also encouraged detailed data collection about respondents' backgrounds, such as African American, Jamaican and Haitian under the Black category. Missing from the list of backgrounds under the new MENA category: Black Arabs from such countries as Somalia and Sudan, and Armenians. The groups were left out after a 2015 field test by the Census Bureau found that most Armenians still identified as white and most Somali and Sudanese respondents identified as Black even when MENA was an option. Some advocates said the decision to omit Black Arabs from being included in the MENA category was based on outdated research. For many Armenian Americans, not having their own category amounts to an existential threat as a large part of their diaspora's culture is now concentrated in the United States. Ethnic Armenians also have communities around Europe and the Middle East, in particular Lebanon. Many are descendants of those who fled the 1915 campaign by Ottoman Turks in which some 1.5 million Armenians died in massacres, deportations and forced marches. The atrocities, which emptied many ethnic areas in eastern Turkey, are widely viewed by historians as genocide . Turkey rejects the description of genocide, saying the toll has been inflated and that those killed were victims of civil war and unrest during World War I. Without Armenian inclusion in the MENA subcategories, many will likely categorize themselves as being from a different country. That could diminish their official numbers and reduce their power when it comes to redrawing political districts in places with large Armenian communities, said Sophia Armen, chair of the Census Taskforce of the Armenian National Committee of America-Western Region. “We will now be undercounted by potentially hundreds of thousands of people,” Armen said. “It spells out a very real destruction of Armenian identity in the next two generations.” During the last redistricting round following the 2020 census, Armenians in greater Los Angeles — which has the largest concentration of Armenians outside Armenia — were almost split up into different city districts, but the redistricting plan was modified after they sounded the alarm. There are an estimated 460,000 Armenian Americans in the U.S. , with half living in California, according to the 2022 American Community Survey. Being identified in the data correctly also is important to local health departments. It can influence anything from vaccination outreach in the proper language to tailoring health campaigns for specific communities. Armenian Americans, for instance, are more likely to suffer from hypertension than the general population, but there’s not a lot of data. MANY BRAZILIANS IDENTIFY AS HISPANIC A coding error last year in an annual Census Bureau survey offered unprecedented insight into how large numbers of Brazilians in the U.S. identify as Hispanic or Latino. An analysis by Pew Research Center showed that the coding mistake revealed at least 416,000 Brazilians, or more than two-thirds of Brazilians in the U.S., also identified as Hispanic in the 2020 American Community Survey. Usually, if someone marks Hispanic and Brazilian on the survey, they are recoded as “not Hispanic” when the numbers are crunched. Not including Brazilians, or Haitians for that matter, in the definition of Hispanic or Latino, means that large numbers of Afro-Latinos aren't counted, Michelle Bueno Vásquez, a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Northwestern University, wrote the Office of Management and Budget. “The OMB as it stands fails Latinos, especially Afro-Latinos who continually suffer double discrimination and marginalization, on top of statistical invisibility, in the United States,” she said. Researching the impacts of categorizing Brazilians as Hispanic was among the recommendations a Census Bureau advisory committee made last month. “Policy is driven by data, first and foremost,” Armen said of people who feel missed in the classifications. “It just seems like we are purposely being ignored.” ___ Follow Mike Schneider on X, formerly known as Twitter: @MikeSchneiderAP .

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The testimony in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It's impossible to say how long all of that will take, but in a landmark trial that's already featured its fair share of memorable moments , this week could easily be the most important. Here's what to expect in the days ahead: WHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS? Starting Tuesday morning, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments expected to last for much of the day, if not all of it. The arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election to a porn star who alleged she had a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations. Look for prosecutors to remind jurors that they can trust the financial paperwork they've seen and the witnesses they've heard from. That includes porn actor Stormy Daniels , whose account of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump is at the heart of the case, and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme and authorized payments. It's worth remembering that the defense, which called only two witnesses but not Trump, doesn't have to prove anything or convince jurors of Trump's innocence. To prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases. Expect the defense to try to poke holes in the government's case by disputing Daniels' testimony about her hotel suite encounter with Trump and by distancing Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements to Cohen, who was responsible for the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels. The defense may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid. And it'll certainly attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand . How much of his testimony the jury believes will go a long way in determining the outcome of the case. Since the prosecution has the burden of proof, it will deliver its summation last — the reverse order from opening statements, in which the prosecution went first. ONE LAST THING BEFORE THE JURY DELIBERATES A critical moment will take place, perhaps Wednesday morning, before the jury begins its deliberations. Judge Juan M. Merchan is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence. In an indication of just how important those instructions are, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a spirited debate last week outside the jury's presence as they sought to persuade Merchan about the instructions he should give. The Trump team, for instance, sought an instruction informing jurors that the types of hush money payments at issue in Trump’s case are not inherently illegal, a request a prosecutor called “totally inappropriate.” Merchan said such an instruction would go too far and is unnecessary. Trump's team also asked Merchan to consider the “extraordinarily important” nature of the case when issuing his instructions and to urge jurors to reach “very specific findings.” Prosecutors objected to that as well, and Merchan agreed that it would be wrong to deviate from the standard instructions. “When you say it’s a very important case, you’re asking me to change the law, and I’m not going to do that,” Merchan said. Prosecutors, meanwhile, requested an instruction that someone’s status as a candidate doesn’t need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign. Defense lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn’t running, it shouldn’t be treated as a campaign contribution. ONCE THE JURY GETS THE CASE The deliberations will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that's intentionally opaque. Jurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it's hard to read too much into the meaning of any note. It's anyone's guess how long the jury will deliberate for and there's no time limit either. The jury must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that could take some time, and a verdict might not come by the end of the week. To reach a verdict, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it. Things will get trickier if the jury can't reach a consensus after several days of deliberations. Though defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial, Merchan is likely to call the jurors in and instruct them to keep trying for a verdict and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others. If, after that instruction, the jury still can't reach a verdict, the judge would have the option to deem the panel hopelessly deadlocked and declare a mistrial. ___ Associated Press writers Jennifer Peltz, Michael R.

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — Dairy-loving daredevils threw caution to the wind Monday for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. Cheered by several thousand spectators, scores of reckless racers chased 7-pound (3 kilogram) wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of London, since at least 1826, and the sport of cheese-rolling is believed to be much older. The rough-and-tumble event often comes with safety concerns. Few competitors manage to stay on their feet all the way down the 200-yard (180 meter) hill. This year’s hill was especially slippery and muddy after recent rain. Members of a local rugby club lined up at the bottom to catch the tumbling competitors. Winners of the three men's races included local man Josh Shepherd as well as competitors from Germany and Australia. Abby Lampe from North Carolina won the women’s race with a lighting-fast roll that left the rest of the field far behind. “You just have to roll,” said Lampe, a graduate of NC State who also won in 2022. “There’s a little bit of pain, but it’s just going to be temporary.” Dozens of children and adults also competed in safer and slower, but no less grueling, uphill versions of the race, which are traditionally held on a late-May national holiday. About 20 miles (32 kilometers) away in the town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds (27 kilograms) over a 240-yard (220-meter) course up and down steep Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972, drawing on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town.",

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel faced new condemnation on Monday for strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah that local health officials said killed at least 45 Palestinians, including displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas , with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel asserts that it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt its offensive in Rafah. Israel said it was looking into the civilian deaths, saying it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior Hamas militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “We pulled out people who were in an unbearable state,\" said Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan. “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal.” The Gaza Health Ministry said around half of the dead were women, children and older adults. On Monday, barefoot children poked at the blackened debris as searches continued. France, a close European ally of Israel, said it was “outraged” by the violence. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had been housing more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group on Sunday launched a barrage of rockets from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said that bombings like the one in Rafah will have long-standing repercussions for Israel. “Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,′′ he told SKY TG24. Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the strikes could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strikes. Egypt's Foreign Ministry described the strike on Tel al-Sultan as a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable the punishment is usually light. Israel has adamantly denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "content": "On Thursday morning, over 100 suspected hoodlums attacked a police station in the Ipaja area of Lagos State. Eyewitnesses reported that the attack was likely a response to a police raid on motorcycle riders, known locally as Okada riders, in the area. The confrontation led to an exchange of gunfire, causing panic and forcing passersby to flee for safety. The police, however, successfully repelled the attackers. Benjamin Hundeyin, the police spokesman in Lagos State, confirmed to Channels Television that the assailants were indeed Okada riders retaliating against the enforcement actions taken by the police. He praised the officers and men of the Ipaja division for their strong resistance against the attack. Hundeyin did not provide details on whether there were any casualties during the incident but assured that normalcy had been restored to the area. Additional police detachments have been deployed to maintain order and prevent further disturbances. ALSO READ THESE TOP STORIES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE",

        "content": "The Nigeria Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ), FCT chapter, has urged government to address the increasing numbers of street children and ensure the protection of the rights of every Nigerian child. The Chairperson of the association in Abuja, Mrs Bassey Ita-Ikpang, made the call in a statement on Monday to commemorate the 2024 International Children’s Day celebration. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the children’s day is marked every year on May 27 as sanctioned by the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) to celebrate and appreciate the needs of children and address them. First established in Nigeria in 1964, the day is also to raise awareness on issues that affect children and help nations to appreciate the fact that they are the future of societies. Ita-Ikpang, who noted the increasing number of street children in Abuja, urged Mrs Adedayo Benjamins-Laniyi, the Mandate Secretary, Federal Capital Territoey Aadministration (FCTA), Women Affairs and Children, to implement policies and programmes that would address the menace. She urged the mandate secretary to do more for children, following insecurities in the FCT. She stated that “there is need to address the increasing number of school-age children hawking on the streets.” The chairperson also urged government, parents, schools and other stakeholders to ensure that child rights are not trampled upon. “It is government’s responsibility to protect every Nigerian child and formulate policies that carry them along and consider their vulnerability, by protecting their basic rights,” she added. She noted some of the rights to include Right to Freedom of Movement, Right to Dignity of the Child, Right to Survival and Development, Right to freedom from discrimination and Education. Others, she stated, are Rights to Inclusion in Decisions Making, Healthy Environment, Access to Medical Care and Safety in School. (NAN)",

Some of those killed were displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire. Many were women and children. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas. Even some of its closest allies like the United States are expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel says it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts. One of those courts last week demanded that Israel halt its offensive in Rafah. EU, Israel in war of words as ties nosedive ahead of Spain, Ireland recognizing Palestinian state BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel took a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain. Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah while Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including the leader of Hamas. Latest deadly weather in US kills at least 20 as storms carve path of ruin across multiple states VALLEY VIEW, Texas (AP) — Powerful storms have killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas. The storms obliterated homes and destroyed a truck stop where drivers took shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park. Eight people were killed in Arkansas. Three died in Kentucky, and two were killed in Oklahoma. Tens of thousands of residents were without power across the region. Papua New Guinea says Friday's landslide buried more than 2,000 people and formally asks for help MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A Papua New Guinea government official has told the United Nations more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive by a landslide Friday. The official formally asked for international help. The government figure is roughly triple a U.N. estimate of 670 killed in the landslide in the South Pacific island nation’s mountainous interior. In a letter seen by The Associated Press to the United Nations resident coordinator dated Sunday, the acting director of the South Pacific island nation’s National Disaster Center Luseta Laso Mana said the landslide “buried more than 2000 people alive” and caused “major destruction” at Yambali village in the Enga province. Estimates of the casualties have varied widely. Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms in Trump hush money trial WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. Perhaps Wednesday, before the jury begins deliberations, the judge is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case. China has threatened trade with some countries after feuds. They're calling 'the firm' for help WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. State Department has set up an eight-person team known as “the firm” to provide help to countries cut off from Chinese trade. The team emerged after Washington stepped in to help Lithuania when the northern European country found its cargo shipments to and from China stranded two years ago during a feud over Taiwan. State Department officials say Washington sees ”the firm” as an emergency response when a country fears facing economic pressure from China. The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. says Beijing opposes economic coercion and calls the American allegation “completely unfounded.\" Russian POWs get to make phone calls home. Ukrainians don't. A growing movement wants that to change FAR WESTERN UKRAINE (AP) — For hundreds of Russian soldiers taken prisoner, phone calls home can offer a bit of comfort and hope. It's a lifeline unavailable to Ukrainian POWs, whose families have gone without hearing their voices. Now, Ukrainian families of POWs are demanding an end to the calls to Russia. They're appealing a decision to block a petition that got more than 25,000 signatures. The families’ anger and the petition rejection come amid widespread reports of systematic mistreatment of Ukrainians in Russian captivity. Ukraine has regularly opened its main POW camp to the Red Cross, the U.N. and journalists. The Associated Press recently visited the western Ukraine site. It's a full day’s journey from the front lines. The visit took place on condition its location not be revealed. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030. Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance. Military labs do the detective work to identify soldiers decades after they died in World War II OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. (AP) — Generations of American families have grown up not knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones who died while serving their country in World War II and other conflicts. But a federal lab tucked away above the bowling alley at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha and a sister lab in Hawaii are steadily answering those lingering questions. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency experts strive to offer about 200 families annually the chance to honor their relatives with a proper burial. Advances in DNA technology, combined with innovative techniques including comparing bones to chest X-rays taken by the military, mean the labs can identify more of the missing soldiers every year.",

        "content": "On Monday, May 27, the Indian stock market benchmark, the Sensex, topped the 76,000 mark for the first time, while another key index, Nifty 50, breached 23,100. During the session, the Sensex and the Nifty 50 hit fresh record highs of 76,009.68 and 23,110.80, respectively. Nifty 50 has gained 24 per cent over the last year, and its current PE (price-to-earnings ratio) stands at 21.9. This is below its one-year average PE of 22.3. However, Nifty's 12-month forward PE of 20.76. Nifty's current PB (price-to-book ratio) is at 4, slightly above its one-year average PB of 4.03. Also Read: Many experts believe the Nifty 50 is currently overvalued, and a negative surprise in the Lok Sabha election results could trigger a significant market correction. However, if the election outcome aligns with expectations and India's economic growth maintains its momentum, the Nifty 50 may sustain its current valuation. Mint spoke to several experts to take their views on the current valuation of the Indian stock market. Here's what they said: Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities Jasani pointed out that the Nifty quotes at nearly 21 times FY25E EPS and, going by historical trends, is currently at the top end of the valuation. Also, according to the market-to-GDP ratio, the Indian stock market is at 1.4 times. Indian markets are, hence, not cheap and are tilting towards the expensive side, he added. However, Jasani believes the ensuing event (outcome of the Lok Sabha election 2024) and the expectations built around the post-government formation policy thrust and FPI inflows have led to these valuations. “If these come out on expected lines and the monsoon proves normal in intensity and spread, Nifty EPS may be upgraded, and the valuations may seem more reasonable,\" said Jasani. Also Read: Abhishek Jain, Head of Research, Arihant Capital Jain said the Indian stock market is currently trading at a premium, reflecting expectations of strong growth after Prime Minister Modi's potential re-election. This optimism has pushed valuations higher. However, a correction might occur after the election results, said Jain. Corporate earnings will likely drive long-term growth, particularly in manufacturing and other sectors that could benefit from increased foreign direct investment (FDI) under a stable government, he added. Also Read: Vijay Laxmi A Ambala, SEBI-registered research analyst Ambala said the current Nifty level is 23,000, and several indicators collectively suggest that the Nifty is currently overvalued. The index’s RSI is trading at 76 on the monthly and 67 on the weekly timeframe, indicating overbought conditions. Judging by the current price movement and RSI reading, Ambala believes the Nifty may move upward by another 300-500 points within the next month. “Those with a short-term view may book up to 30 per cent of their portfolio to capitalise on the all-time high rally while holding on to the remainder to capitalise on the potential upside rally. They can average their profits if there is a healthy dip between 5-8 per cent. The Indian stock market is still in its growth phase and there is ample room for growth, making it more lucrative than most global economies,\" said Ambala. The current stock market valuation also accounts for the Indian market's growth potential, suggesting a fair valuation. “While price appreciation may slow down, we expect to record double-digit growth in the next three years, supported by sectors like auto, metal, energy, infrastructure, and real estate. IT, media, and service sectors are currently undervalued, making them lucrative. I recommend investing in stocks of core sectors with strong fundamentals to make the most of the prevailing circumstances,\" said Ambala. Sandeep Raina, Executive Vice President-Research at Nuvama Professional Clients Group According to Raina, the Indian stock market is fairly valued and offers good opportunities. Many stocks and sectors look interesting. Historically, the market has peaked at around 24 times the 12-month forward earnings for the Nifty 50, Raina said. “We expect EPS (earnings per share) of approximately 1,080 for FY25E. Hence, reaching the 24,000 to 25,000 level seems quite possible, assuming the Indian elections proceed smoothly,\" said Raina.

        "content": "The Houston Astros expect to have a familiar face back in the clubhouse when they open a four-game series Monday at Seattle. First baseman Jose Abreu is scheduled to rejoin the ballclub after he was optioned to the Astros' spring training complex in West Palm Beach, Fla. He had been working on his swing with, among others, Hall of Fame member Jeff Bagwell and former teammate Michael Brantley. Abreu, the 2020 American League MVP with the Chicago White Sox, was batting .099 with one extra-base hit and three RBIs in 22 games when he was sent to the minors for the first time in his career. \"What I can tell you is my head is in a good spot right now,\" Abreu told The Athletic. \"When I was going through it, when your head is not in a good spot, you feel like everything is going down. There was a point, and I'm telling you from the bottom of my heart, I couldn't even know how to hit, how to field. I was a little lost. But I'm humble enough to recognize that and I'm telling you I'm trying to be the best Jose Abreu I can be and the one you guys know.\" Abreu went 7-for-22 with a homer and three RBIs in the Florida Complex League before playing in two games for the Triple-A Sugar Land Space Cowboys, going 0-for-7 with three strikeouts. \"The plan is to bring him for the Seattle series and just come in with confidence,\" Astros manager Joe Espada said. \"He has made adjustments that we feel are going to help him and we just expect him to come back up here and just be himself and we're going to help him, get him rolling. We're all waiting for him, our players are excited, we are excited to have him back, so we're looking forward to it.\" Abreu, 37, batted .237 with 18 home runs and 90 RBIs last season, his first in Houston after signing a three-year, $58.5 million deal. \"I was wrong on my swing, and games speed up on you too much and it's tough to see where you're at,\" Abreu said through an interpreter. \"I saw videos and didn't see it, and now we found it and I hope that I can show it right away, right now, but it's baseball, it's a process.\" The Astros won 5-2 at Oakland on Sunday as Kyle Tucker belted a two-run homer and Ronel Blanco allowed the Athletics one run on four hits over seven innings. \"He didn't miss a beat,\" Espada said of Blanco, who returned from a 10-game suspension for having an illegal substance on his glove. Houston has won 10 of its past 14 games to pull within 3 1/2 games of the American League West-leading Mariners. On May 1, the Astros were in last place in the division, 6 1/2 games out. Seattle snapped a season-worst, four-game losing streak with a 9-5 victory at Washington on Sunday. Julio Rodriguez went 3-for-5 with a home run and four RBIs and Ty France went deep and drove in three. Rodriguez homered in each of the last two games in the series to double his season total to four. \"Huge game by Julio,\" Mariners manager Scott Servais said. \"Really happy for him. Everybody's happy to see it. That's the Julio Rodriguez we've grown to know over the last couple of years and hopefully he can keep that going. That's the best he's looked all year.\" Astros left-hander Framber Valdez (3-2, 4.32 ERA) is set to start the series opener Monday against Mariners right-hander Bryce Miller (3-5, 3.53). Valdez is 5-2 with a 3.41 ERA in 13 career appearances (11 starts) against Seattle; Miller is 2-1, 3.22 in four career starts versus Houston. Valdez lost 5-0 to the visiting Mariners on May 4 as he allowed five runs on nine hits in 5 1/3 innings. Miller didn't get a decision in Seattle's 5-4 victory at Houston on May 5, a game in which he gave up four runs on six hits over six innings. --Field Level Media",

        "content": "Doja Cat has again put her father on blast for allegedly being an absent father. The American singer called her father actor Dumisani Dlamini a “dead beat” in an updated X bio, writing: “My dad's a deadbeat but I did well.” On Monday, Doja Cat shot up trends lists after she took to her Instagram timeline, writing: “ Dad, let me know when/if you need me to re-up your makeup cabinet because you are a b*tch.” Despite numerous attempts by TshisaLIVE‚ Dumisani could not be reached for comment at the time of publishing this article. Doja Cat has always spoken openly about her father, saying “she has never met him” but has seen him commenting on her social media posts. Speaking to TshisaLIVE in a 2017 interview, Dumisani said after the Sarafina! tour wrapped up he decided to stay in America and had two children with a Jewish-American woman, one of them Doja Cat. After 15 years Dumisani returned to South Africa and said his plans to bring his family with him were unsuccessful, though he maintained contact with his children. “I am close to my children, all of them. I love them and they love me.” Dumisani, who has gushed over Doja Cat's global success, said his legacy is his children. “ I’m proud of her for what she has achieved. I’m not surprised because it’s in the blood. All my children are talented. South Africa should be proud of such a great talent coming from us.”",

        "content": "Stella Salle became a TikTok star for impersonating the way drunk people speak. Because of her hilarious personality, she garnered a significant following and won the affection of many on social media. This eventually led to Colourette Cosmetics appointing her as one of their brand ambassadors, alongside Sassa Gurl and other members of the LGBTQ+ community. This local makeup brand is known to champion diversity, as their advocacy is to make its users feel empowered, confident, and beautiful in all ways, always. Just recently, however, Stella Salle reposted the artist’s photos and wrote, “ panget [ugly],” in the caption. Many A’TINs (SB19’s fandom name) were outraged and demanded an apology from the content creator. The widespread criticism, not only from fans but also from numerous social media users who found the post offensive, has caught the attention of Colourette’s founder, Nina Ellaine. In response, the company released a statement announcing the termination of their endorsement ties with Stella Salle. This decision was made because her actions contradicted the values upheld by the cosmetic brand. According to the statement from the CEO, “Having faced public scrutiny for my appearance, I have always championed self-love and empowerment. Due to recent events with one of our ambassadors, Colourette takes a firm stand against bullying and shaming, and we are disengaging from Stella.” 🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼 pic.twitter.com/jqRHso2Uxl — Nina 💖 (@theninaellaine) May 25, 2024 After facing backlash for her unsolicited comments and being called out by fans and other social media users, Stella Salle released an apology letter, which she posted on her official TikTok account. However, many argue that the damage has already been done. The inappropriate post from the influencer is particularly troubling given that she claims to be a victim of cyberbullying and face-shaming herself. Others have also pointed out that Stella Salle is considered an influential figure, especially since she represents a brand and is expected to uphold its values. Therefore, she should have been more cautious about the statements she posts on social media platforms. On the other hand, one social media user criticized the brand for abruptly removing the influencer as an ambassador. In a viral tweet, he wrote, “I don’t get it. You get an ambassador or ambassadress without you guys having to background check? We all know that stella is kanal humor, straightforward and opinionated towards things.” This controversy serves as a reminder to all social media influencers (and even users) to exercise extra caution in their actions, particularly in this day and age, where words can have far-reaching consequences.

        "content": "Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who passed away at 15 from leukemia in 2006, is set to become the first “millennial” saint, the Holy See announced on May 23. Despite his parents not being traditionally fully devoted Catholics, Acutis insisted on regularly attending daily Mass. As an expression of his faith, he created a website that documents Eucharistic miracles around the world. This website is currently available in around 20 languages. “To always be close to Jesus, that’s my life plan,” he once said when he was just 7 years old. In 2020, the Vatican beatified Acutis after acknowledging a miracle attributed to his intercession: the healing of a Brazilian boy with a rare pancreatic disease in 2013. More recently, Pope Francis approved a second miracle linked to Acutis: the recovery of Valeria Valverde, a Costa Rican student who sustained a severe head injury in 2022 after accidentally falling from her bike. This latest approval clears the way for Acutis’s canonization. The 15-year-old, who loved playing online games and even watched Pokémon, is beloved for his spirituality and his innovative use of technology to spread the message of Christianity. He was also dubbed “God’s influencer.” Other POP! stories that you might like: 90-year-old black astronaut becomes the oldest man to travel to space Millennials and Gen Z challenges workplace norms with ‘quiet vacationing’ NewJeans Members’ parents speaks out against HYBE, HYBE replies Anticipation builds as release date of ‘Grand Theft Auto VI’ reportedly set for fall 2025 Transgender student runner booed after winning women’s 200-meter run competition Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

Some even pointed out that the presence of ex-member Kibum made the moments even more special because for them, time had only passed but they knew that the love between Elf and SuJu remained. Kibum's presence is truly a sight to behold! It's moments like these that remind us of the bonds that transcend time. Seeing him reunited with the SuJu hyungs is like a dream come true for many of us. 💙 #Kibum #SuperJunior #Reunion #SuJuHyungs #PreciousMoments pic.twitter.com/fnMahunQ7k — Mohamad Faizal bin Abdullah (@NickoAlberto) May 27, 2024 I'm a 2017 ELF so it means I went from seeing the least active member to a 15 members reunion today.

        "content": "THERE'S a perfect match out there for everyone — even two twins joined at the hip. And what better match for a pair of identical twin sisters than identical twin brothers? Kerissa Sealby spoke to The U.S. Sun about how she and her twin sister Vanessa dated and married another set of twins. Though they're clearly embracing their double status now, that wasn't always the case. The mother of one recalled how she and her sister fought their similarities throughout their childhood and teenage years. \"We always really wanted to be so different, even though we just are not,\" she said. \"We always thought we had different tastes in guys, I hated her boyfriends and she hated mine. \"It just never worked out, they never understood our relationship as twins either.\" While some classmates growing up thought it would be \"so cool\" is Kerissa and Vanessa ended up dating twin brothers, the sisters did not share the same enthusiasm. So it was rather reluctantly that they agreed to a blind double date with another pair of identical twins. \"We were going into it thinking, ‘Whatever, we'll be friends with them. It's cool to be connected to other sets of twins and they had just moved to the area,'\" she said. Kerissa admitted that neither sibling set ever thought they would end up dating twins. However, when her now brother-in-law Lucas got strep throat, he found himself at an urgent care clinic. He struck up a conversation with his physician, who later sent him a message suggesting that he and his twin, Jacob, take out her personal trainer and her twin. The two brothers and two sisters met up that same night with some hesitation. \"Me and Vanessa were both thinking, ‘Ew, we're not dating twins, that’s so weird,'\" Kerissa said. \"But the moment that we laid eyes on each other, I just gravitated towards Jacob and Vanessa gravitated towards Lucas and it was like ‘Yeah, this is it.’\" Both women returned home gushing over their new matches while Jacob and Lucas, both physician's assistants, called their parents to say they had both found the one. After their initial double date, they decided to go on individual dates to get to know each other better. Fast forward six months and both pairs have made it official, and soon the four adults were all living together. \"I actually made a post on my Instagram when she got married saying, ‘I’ll miss having the same last name as you for eight months. Their relationships continued on similar trajectorIES, with Kerissa and Jacob getting engaged in December 2021 and tying the knot in June 2023. Vanessa, who accepted Lucas' proposal in January 2022, officially changed her surname in October of the same year. \"I actually made a post on my Instagram when she got married saying, ‘I’ll miss having the same last name as you for eight months,'\" Kerissa joked. She and Jacob also welcomed daughter Sophie in August 2022 with her cousin Adrian joining a while after. The sisters hadn't considered their children's unique DNA situation until it became a reality. \"We didn't really think about how our kids would be genetically the same until I had Sophie,\" Kerissa recalled. \"Vanessa was trying to get pregnant and [we joked], ‘Actually, you technically could be Sophie's mom.’ My sister is like a mom to my daughter and I mean, genetically, it's that way as well. \"And technically, I could be Adrian's mom and people would never know if they looked at our DNA.\" Technically cousins but genetically siblings, the children have had some double-take moments when identifying their parents. Speaking about her daughter Sophie, Kerissa said the infant was better at telling her mother and aunt apart. \"Sophie is old enough now to distinguish but she did get confused a little bit with her dad and uncle Lucas,\" she said. My sister is like a mom to my daughter and I mean, genetically, it's that way as well. \"It's funny, she has this relationship with her uncle, she loves him but she plays more with him. \"She gives him dirty looks and runs away [but with her] dad she's completely the opposite.\" Another advantage of having your sister and brother-in-law so close by, right next door in fact, is full access babysitting, Kerissa said. She also pointed out that every holiday and vacation can be spent together as there is no need to divide time between various sets of in-laws. \"My sister is like a mom to my daughter and I mean, genetically, it's that way as well,\" she said. We know that we're always there for each other and it's been that way our whole lives. \"If I need to bring my daughter over and leave her, I can and she's the same, there's no having to plan it. \"We know that we're always there for each other and it's been that way our whole lives.\" The sisters, who both work together at a real estate firm, have a family history of twins. \"My grandma was actually a twin, as well,\" Kerissa said. \"She had just recently passed away when we met [Jaoband Lucas] and so my mom was in tears and felt like our grandma sent them for us.\" Genetically, the four kids are known as quaternary siblings, which is a rare occurrence. This is when cousins have matching DNA like siblings have. The kids share the same DNA as brothers and sisters but are still technically cousins. The kids also might even share similar looks. Quaternary twins are born less than nine months apart to two sets of identical siblings. Scientific experts do not technically refer to the kids as 'twins'. She referred to their chance set-up as \"divine intervention\" and said she couldn't imagine a life where her twin sister wasn't also her sister-in-law. And while the couples may receive some ignorant comments online implying that their situation is incestuous, they're excited to share their story further. You can follow their story on Kerissa and Vanessa's TikTok accounts.",

        "content": "A new study demonstrates an advance in treating antibiotic-resistant infections in animals through personalized phage therapy. The treatment combined a specific anti-P. aeruginosa phage applied topically with ceftazidime administered intramuscularly, resulting in the complete healing of a persistent surgical wound after fourteen weeks. This highlights the potential of phage therapy as a practical and effective solution for antibiotic-resistant infections in veterinary practice, with implications for human medicine as well. A new study led by Prof. Ronen Hazan and his team, from the Faculty of Dental Medicine at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in collaboration with the team of Vet Holim, JVMV -Veterinary medical center in Kiryat -Anavim, Israel, has shown an advance in the treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections in animals. This research, focusing on a five-year-old Siamese cat Squeaks with a multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection post-arthrodesis surgery, marks the first published documented application of personalized phage therapy in veterinary medicine. Squeaks, initially treated at the JVMV for injuries sustained from a high-rise fall, developed a severe infection in the right hind leg following multiple surgeries. This infection persisted despite various antibiotic treatments over four months. Facing a potential implant-replacement surgery, the team turned to the new treatment which involved a meticulously designed combination of a specific anti- P. aeruginosa phage, a virus that kills bacteria, applied topically to the surgical wound and ceftazidime administered intramuscularly. Moreover, the owners of the cat, after short demonstration, provides most of the treatment doses of phages and antibiotics at their home. The integration of phage therapy with antibiotics was aimed at targeting the pathogen effectively and directly at the site of infection, leveraging the phage's ability to be applied topically, which simplifies administration and maximizes its concentration at the infection site. This approach allowed the surgical wound, which had remained open for five months, to fully heal after to fourteen weeks of treatment. The successful outcome of this case underscores the critical need for novel therapeutics like phage therapy to address the growing concern of antibiotic-resistant infections, which affect up to 8.5% of surgical sites following orthopedic surgeries in companion animals. These infections not only pose significant health risks to the animals but also increase the morbidity, mortality, and costs associated with these procedures. Recent studies suggest that phage therapy, already showing high success rates in human medicine for treating orthopedic infections and chronically infected wounds, can offer a promising solution for similar issues in veterinary practice. Moreover, the successful treatment of this cat by its owners at home highlights the practicality and efficacy of personalized phage therapy, which could be extended to treat other pets facing similar antimicrobial resistance challenges. Interestingly, opposite to common situations, this case was performed on an animal based on the team's insights from treating humans first. The positive reception from veterinarians and pet owners regarding phage therapy points to a growing awareness and acceptance of this treatment option. As the new treatment continues to be explored in veterinary settings, it not only improves the health and well-being of pets but also offers valuable data that contribute to the broader application of phage therapy in both animals and humans. This bridging of data can enhance treatment protocols and outcomes across a variety of bacterial infections, potentially changing the landscape of infection treatment in both veterinary and human medicine.

        "content": "Brazil's Ronaldinho stars in charity match for flood victim Brazilian football great Ronaldinho came out of retirement Sunday for a charity match to raise funds for those affected by devastating flooding in the country's south. The Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona legend notched two goals and an assist in the 5-5 tie at the match in Rio de Janeiro's Maracana stadium. Ronaldinho, whose full name is Ronaldo de Assis Moreira, is from Brazil's Rio Grande do Sul state, which has been reeling from weeks of unprecedented floods that have killed more than 160 people and left 90 percent of its towns inundated, AFP reports. A slew of Brazilian football stars got together for Sunday's charity match, including coach Dorival Junior and former right-back Cafu. \"It's moving to see all these people coming together to help my people,\" Ronaldinho said. \"After this immeasurable tragedy, we see the Brazilian people uniting again,\" Junior said. Ronaldinho, 44, put in his team's fourth and fifth goals, while Cafu also shone with a goal and an assist. He left the pitch with 15 minutes on the clock, to a standing ovation. Women's stars also took part in the match, including Formiga. Cities and rural areas alike in Rio Grande do Sul have been hit for weeks by an unprecedented climate disaster of torrential rains and deadly flooding. More than half a million people have fled their homes, and authorities have been unable to fully assess the extent of the damage. In state capital Porto Alegre, floodwaters rose again on Thursday amid new rainfall. The floods mark the region's fourth extreme weather event in less than a year, a phenomenon scientists say is driven by climate change and also deforestation. Governor Eduardo Leite told TV Globo on Saturday evening that the reconstruction could last \"several months, or even more than a year.\" SR",

        "content": "writes that lawyers have decried the ‘illegal’ use of the Cybercrime Act by the police to harass and detain journalists, with a call on the National Assembly to promptly begin the process of amending the legislation in order to safeguard press freedom in the country Some senior lawyers have called on the National Assembly to promptly commence the process of amending the Cyber Crime Act 2015 in order to curb its ‘illegal’ use by the police to brutalize journalists. The lawyers described the legislation as tool being used by the police witch hunt journalists and gag the press . The call by the lawyers was premised on the recent arrest of an investigative journalist, Daniel Ojukwu, by the police for allegedly violating the country’s cybercrime laws..Ojukwu’s arrest was just one out of the many arrests that have been carried out by the police . Reacting to the sad development, Ojukwu’s employer, Nigeria’s Foundation for Investigative Journalism (FIJ) said its reporter, Daniel Ojukwu, went missing on May 1, but it was only informed two days later that he had been detained by police under the cybercrime law. FIJ said Ojukwu’s arrest was related to a November story that exposed government corruption. Justifying the journalist detention, police spokesperson, Muyiwa Adejobi, told reporters that Ojukwu was arrested by the Nigeria Police National Cybercrime Centre based on a petition filed against him. Earlier in February, four journalists from an online news site, Informant247, were arrested, detained, and charged with conspiracy, cyberstalking and defamation by the police. According to the police, the charges levelled against the quartet of Adisa-Jaji Azeez, Salihu Ayatullahi, Salihu Shola Taofeek and Abdulrahman Taye Damilola, was sequel to a complaint lodged against them by the Rector of Kwara State Polytechnic, Engineer Abdul Jimoh Muhammed. The complaint was said to have stemmed from reports that were published by the news site on November 10, 2023 and February 1, 2024, alleging that the Rector had made false claims about the institution’s financial status and commissioned shoddy project work. On February 6, 2024, the Kwara State police invited Adisa-Jaji Azeez and Salihu Ayatullahi for questioning, only for them to be arrested, detained overnight, and presented before the court the following day. In view of this, a Civil Society Group, IPI Africa Advocacy and Partnerships, lead by Nompilo Simanje, had then called for the charges against the journalists to be dropped, and emphasized that journalists must be free to work without fear of intimidation and legal reprisals Simanje said: “This is the latest example of cybercrime laws in Nigeria being used to target journalists. The authorities in Nigeria should amend their legislation to align with regional and international standards. The continued use of such laws like criminal defamation and vague provisions of the cybercrimes act against journalists pose an ongoing risk to media freedom and freedom of expression. “It is appalling that the Nigerian authorities continue to enforce Section 24 of the Cybercrimes Act, which was declared by the ECOWAS Court of Justice to be inconsistent and incompatible with Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights”. Asides these four journalists, several other journalists in Nigeria have been arrested, detained, and arraigned in recent years on charges stemming from the Cybercrime Act. Notable among the lists is the 34-day detention of journalist Agba Jalingo and the jailing of Saint Mienpamo Onitsha, who was later released after four months in jail. It would be recalled that the Cybercrime (Prohibition and Prevention) Act was signed into law on the 15th of May, 2015 by the then-President, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, at the twilight of his administration. The law was enacted based on the understanding that threats to information and communication technology are a danger to Nigeria’s national security, affecting the country’s “economic, political, and social fabric”. The Act also ensures the protection of critical national information infrastructure, and promotes cybersecurity, while also protecting computer systems and networks, electronic communications, data and computer programs, intellectual property and privacy rights Cybercrime is however a term for any illegal activity that uses a computer as its primary means. It also includes any illegal activity that uses a computer for the storage of evidence. Cybercrime include crimes that have been made possible by computers, such as network intrusions and the dissemination of computer viruses, as well as computer-based variations of existing crimes, such as identity theft, stalking, bullying and terrorism. Section 24 of the Cybercrime Act, 2015 had criminalised ‘cyberstalking’, ”insult’, ‘causing annoyance’, ‘sending offensive messages’, and ‘criminal intimidation’ ”insult’, ‘causing annoyance’, ‘sending offensive messages’, and ‘criminal intimidation’. Specifically, Section 24 provided as follows: “(a) Any person who, knowingly or intentionally sends a message or other matter by means of computer systems or network that (a) is grossly offensive, pornographic or of an indecent, obscene, or menacing character or causes any such message or matter to be so sent; or “(b) He knows to be false for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, ill will or needless anxiety to another or causes such a message to be sent: commits an offence under this Act and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not more than N7,000, 000.00 or imprisonment for a term of not more than 3 years or to both such fine and imprisonment”. Meanwhile, in 2022, the ECOWAS Court of Justice ordered the Nigerian government to amend the controversial Section 24 of its cybercrime law which is widely viewed as authorities’ weapon for muzzling citizens’ rights to freedom of expression. The court gave the verdict on March 25, 2022 in Accra, Ghana. In the decision, the court ruled that the contested Section 24 of Nigeria’s Cybercrime (Prohibition, Prevention, etc) Act, 2015 “is not in conformity with Articles 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (ACHPR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)”. Keikura Bangura, the presiding judge, who read the court’s decision, asked Nigerian government to amend the legal provision “in order to ensure conformity with the country’s obligations” under the ACHPR and ICCPR. The decision was delivered in a suit filed by the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), one of the frontline civil society organisations in Nigeria. SERAP, had in its suit, challenged the legality and compatibility of Section 24 of the Cybercrime Act 2015 in relation to the guaranteeing of freedom of expression and information enshrined in Article 9 of the ACHPR and Article 19 of the ICCPR, respectively. They said Section 24 of the cybercrime law criminalises sending a message via a computer system which was “grossly offensive, pornographic or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character” or to send a message or cause any such message or matter to be so sent; or to send a message, knowing it to be false for the purpose of “causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, ill will or needless anxiety to another” or to cause such a message to be sent. It particularly alleged that Section 24 violated the rights to freedom of expression, information and other rights of human rights defenders, activists, bloggers, journalists, broadcasters and social media users through the repressive use, interpretation and by agents of the respondent, the same being vaguely worded and ambiguous. The applicant further contended that since the passage of the Act, the Nigerian government and its agents had used its provisions to harass, intimidate, arbitrarily arrest and detain and unfairly prosecute users of the social media, human rights defenders, activists, journalists, broadcasters and bloggers who express their views perceived to be critical of the Government both at the Federal and State levels. The applicant listed 12 high profile cases of the alleged victims of harassment, intimidation, arrest unlawful detention, prosecution and imprisonment of journalists, bloggers, broadcasters, social media users, human rights defenders and activists, by the respondent, its agents and several states of Nigeria between August 2015 and November 2018, for alleged cyberstalking and urged the court to make several declarations and orders that will underscore the incompatibility of the Act with the provisions of the two international instruments. In its defence, the respondent (the Nigerian government) urged the court to dismiss the suit on the grounds that it was misconceived, adding that the prayers sought were not grantable in law. In particular, the respondent contended that the application was not only pending before the national court for the same reliefs but that the interpretation of Section 24 of the Act must be submitted to domestic courts and not the ECOWAS Court as this is not within its competence as it concerns the interpretation of extant laws. Moreover, the respondent contended that the Act was not only in line with Section 45 of the Nigerian Constitution, but was subjected to the requisite constitutional and legal processes before its passage. It said the applicant was aware of the processes leading up to the passage of the Act into law but did not protest it at the time. The respondent further argued that the Act was not enacted to muzzle the freedom of expression in Nigeria, but to curtail the activities criminals carried out on the internet. Lawyers speak Reacting to this, human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), disclosed that it is illegal to arrest journalists for cyberstalking, insult, causing annoyance, offensive message and criminal intimidation. Falana, in a statement, reiterated that, “the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS) Court declared Section 24 of the Cybercrime Act 2015 illegal and directed the federal government to amend the section to make the law conform with the fundamental right of Nigerian citizens to freedom of expression guaranteed by Section 39 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,1999 and Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004. “However, in the cases of Laws and Rights Awareness Initiative (Suit No. ECW/CCJ/APP/53/18) and Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (Suit Laws and Rights Awareness Initiative (Suit No ECW/CCJ/APP/09/19), the Ecowas Court declared Section 24 of the Cybercrime Act 2015 illegal and directed the federal government to amend the section to make the law conform with the fundamental right of Nigerian citizens to freedom of expression guaranteed by Section 39 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,1999 and Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004. “From the foregoing, it is crystal clear that the police and other security agencies lack the power to arrest, detain and prosecute Nigerian citizens for the so- called offences of ‘cyberstalking’, ”insult’, ‘causing annoyance’, ‘sending offensive messages’, and ‘criminal intimidation’. “Consequently, all pending cases filed on the basis of the repealed aspects of Section 24 of the Cybercrime Act 2015 should be discontinued without any further delay”. In his comments, Onesimus Ruya, argued that the Nigerian cybercrime law seems to be designed to cripple freedom of expression and hinder journalists from performing their duties. “Whoever sponsored the law has so many things in mind at the point of conception. But definitely, it is targeted at Nigerian journalists and infringes on Section 39 of the Constitution. “Sections 24 and 25 of the Act were specifically targeted at journalists, with government, politicians and other influential members of the society using these sections to harass and arrest journalists through the police. “Part of Sections 24 of the Act says, “A person who knowingly or intentionally sends a message or other matter by means of computer or network that – is grossly offensive, pornographic, or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character or causes any such damage or matter to be so sent etc. “These are the most potent aspects of the law that the government and politicians use against journalists and bloggers. These sections say anyone who writes anything considered offensive or abusive by anyone. “This law has no definition, it is nebulous, barbaric and should not operate in the 21st century. That is our submission at the court of law, Our cybercrime law is still the way it is because it has not been tested in the court”, Ruya said. Speaking in the same vein, a senior lawyer, Emmanuel Ekwe, noted that, “Nigeria’s Cybercrime Act is coming under criticism for not striking the right balance between national security and press freedom. “Provisions within the Act have been exploited to stifle freedom of expression, leading to concerns about the potential suppression of dissenting voices and investigative journalism “In the suit filed by the SocioEconomic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), the ECOWAS Court ruled that Section 24 of the Cybercrime Act is arbitrary, unlawful, and requires amendment. The section contains terms like “grossly offensive,” “menacing,” and “obscene,” which are not clearly defined and can be exploited to target journalists or individuals expressing dissenting opinions. “The National Assembly, should prioritize amending the broadly and vaguely worded provisions of the Cybercrimes Act, particularly Sections 16, 24, 26, and 38. This would require collaboration between the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Information, Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy, as well as agencies like the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) and National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), media organizations, and media policy experts”. A law teacher, Dr. Basil Onyewe, while reacting, called for the urgent amendment of the Cybercrimes Act 2015. Onyewe said: “It is, therefore, crucial to submit and caution that the imperative of enacting the Cybercrime Act was not to regulate the activities of journalists. Journalism is a renowned and decent profession with high ethical standards. “However, no one who indulges in the activities criminalised by the Cybercrime act can be rightly referred to as a journalist. “That said, it is sad to note that Government and the political class in Nigeria have deliberately manipulated the provisions of the Cybercrime Act to police journalists and suppress freedom of expression and thoughts, while abandoning the primary objective of the law. “Authorities in government have attempted to silence opposition views in the online media through arbitrary interpretation and abuse of the Cybercrimes (Prohibition and Prevention) Act, 2015, particularly Section 24 of the Act which addresses offensive and annoying statements on the internet otherwise known as cyberstalking, and several journalists, bloggers and individuals have been arrested in this regard. “Stories, articles and expressions published online have been deemed offensive, insulting or annoying with actionable consequences under the said section even when the stories are factual. While some stories published through traditional media outlets (print and electronic) that were never sanctioned by the government have been attacked by the same government upon being rebroadcast or republished through online platforms. “The government considers these repost offensive and libelous because of the rising influence of online platforms in Nigeria as major sources of information dissemination. “Clearly, the government have used the accusation of cyberstalking to harass and press charges against online and traditional journalists for expressing views that are considered unfavourable to the government as some examples will illustrate. “In order to create a fair and egalitarian society , the law should be looked into as not to infringe on the rights to information. “It is only the synergy of such demonstrable acts in good faith by government and the media that a proper and rewarding balance can be found in the media space”",

        "content": "Home | Jagityal | Farmers In Queue Becomes Regular Scene In Telangana Farmers in queue becomes regular scene in Telangana The farmers were seen placing photocopies of the passbooks and Aadhar cards in the queue in front of the PACS in these villages to get 'jeeluga' and 'janumu' green manure seeds. By Telangana Today Published Date - 27 May 2024, 06:58 PM Jagtial farmers place passbooks and Aadhar Cards in queue. Jagtial: Farmers being forced to stand in queues in the scorching heat to get seeds is apparently becoming a regular occurence in Telangana. A sight that was never seen in the last nine years, several seed dispensing outlets of the government are now seeing such queues, with the farmers keeping their pattadar passbooks and Aadhar cards in the queue while they take a break after standing for long hours. If the queue was in front of the Agros Rythu Seva Kendra in Jogipet of Sangareddy last week, it was the turn of farmers in Nukapalli and Potharam of Mallial mandal in Jagtial on Monday to stand in queues in front of Primary Agriculture Cooperatives Societies (PACS) in the district. The farmers were seen placing photocopies of the passbooks and Aadhar cards in the queue in front of the PACS in these villages to get ‘jeeluga’ and ‘janumu’ green manure seeds. Since it was a conventional practice to sow such green manure seeds before the beginning of the agriculture season to reduce the usage of fertilizer, several farmers had rushed to the PACS for the seeds. However, agriculture officials gave only one bag of seeds to each farmer citing a shortage of the seeds. It is learnt that out of 600 bags required for Potharam village, only 100 bags were supplied. This was when there were over 300 farmers in the queue. In Nukapalli, 300 bags were supplied as against the 800 required. There were 450 farmers in the queue. Farmers who did not get seed bags had to return empty handed, cursing their luck. Responding to the issue, former Choppadandi MLA Sunke Ravishankar found fault with the state government for not adequate number of the seeds to farmers within the timeframe. Terming the Congress government as anti-farmer, he said the Congress mark governance had returned to the State in full force. Apart from the drought, farmers were still being made to wait for the promised bonus of Rs.500, while now even green manure seeds were not available as per the requirement, he said. Farmers, who were disheartened after being forced to return without the seeds, said they had never faced such a situation when the BRS government led by K Chandrashekhar Rao was in power. Last week, several farmers, who had stood in queues with pattadar passbooks for their turn to collect tokens for buying green manure seeds at the Agros Rythu Seva Kendra at Jogipet in Sangareddy, were told after hours of waiting that the stocks were over. The irate farmers had staged a protest. There too, the issue was the same one, that of the agriculture outlet not getting adequate stocks.

According to Atiku Abubakar, the deployment of soldiers [...]The post Emir: Atiku berates FG over deployment of soldiers to Kano appeared first on National Daily Newspaper.",
        "content": "“The action of the Federal Government in deploying soldiers in Kano in the tussle over the throne of the ancient city is an upset to the peace and security of the state and also in breach of the 1999 Constitution as Amended. “In performing their constitutional duties of law-making, the Kano State House of Assembly (KSHA) passed the amended Kano State Emirate Council (Repeal) Bill 2024 in consonance with the provision of Section 4 of the Constitution 1999 as Amended, whereas the Governor of Kano State, Engr. Abba Kabir Yusuf subsequently signed the bill into law. “The law, therefore, repealed the 2019 version, which balkanised the ancient Kano Emirate into five. The foregoing circumstances happened within the confines of the law and in compliance with the powers conferred on the Governor as provided by Section 5(2) of the 1999 Constitution as amended; and also in consultation with the Kingmakers of Kano, reappointed Sanusi Lamido Sanusi (also known as Muhammadu Sanusi II) as the 16th Emir of Kano State and accordingly handed him a letter of appointment. “It is surprising that in the early hours of today, at or about 5:30 am, the former Emir of Kano, His Majesty Aminu Ado Bayero, backed by Federal might, made their way into the Nasarawa Palace of the Kano Emirate while the reappointed Emir, Muhammadu Sanusi II, was at the Gidan Dabo, which is the main residence of the Emir of Kano. “We need to remind the Tinubu administration that Kano State is known for peace and harmony spanning thousands of years, and any attempt to destabilise the peace of the Land of Commerce shall be resisted. “Recall that when Muhammadu Sanusi II was dethroned on 9th March 2020, Kano forged on in peace without any fracas. -AA”",

The world number one raced to a 6-1, 6-2 victory after just 61 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier to set up a second-round meeting with fellow four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka. “I’m really happy to be back. Feel like I’m playing really good tennis so hoping to be here as long as possible,” said Swiatek. The 22-year-old Pole is aiming to become the first woman to win three straight Roland Garros titles since Justine Henin in 2007, and only the second ever after Serena Williams to win the Madrid, Rome and French Opens in the same year. “These last tournaments give me a lot (of confidence)... But every tournament is a different story, a different chapter, so I’m just trying to focus on the next match,” added Swiatek. Comments Related stories Related Topics",

        "content": "Kolkata Knight Riders has been crowned champions of the 17th season of the Indian Premier League after the Shreyas Iyer side marauded Sunrisers Hyderabad by eight wickets at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Sunday. The IPL 2024 has witnessed many great performances but the outlier of this season was the Indian youngsters who have taken on the big stage to showcase their latent. Rajasthan Royals’ Riyan Parag plays.| Photo Credit:B. Jothi Ramalingam/The Hindu The 2024 season was the year of redemption for Riyan Parag who had a coming-of-age campaign for Rajasthan Royals. Parag held the key in the middle order for RR and went on to amass 573 runs in 14 innings, the highest for his team this season. The 22-year-old was third in the Orange Cap list overall, just behind Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s Virat Kohli and Chennai Super Kings skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad. Riyan, averaging over 50 this year smoked 33 sixes, the joint fifth most by any batters this year. He registered four half-centuries with the highest being 84* against Delhi Capials. Gujarat Titans Sai Sudharsan.| Photo Credit:Vijay Soneji/The Hindu B. Sai Sudharsan was among the few highs for Gujarat Titans in a season of lows. After making it into the finals for the first two seasons since its inception in 2022, GT, this time, was the second team after Mumbai Indians to get eliminated from the playoffs race. Sudharsan was sixth in the list of highest run-getters in IPL 2024. In just 12 innings, the 22-year-old Tamil Nadu batter had 527 under his belt with an average of 47.90. After playing the majority season at no. three, Sudharsan, was promoted to open in place of regular opener Wriddhiman Saha. His 210-run partnership with skipper Shubman Gill against Chennai Super Kings was the joint-highest opening wicket partnership in IPL history. He scored two fifties and a century. Sunrisers Hyderabad’s Nitish Kumar Reddy.| Photo Credit:Deepak KR/The Hindu In a team full of star performers like Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma and Heinrich Klaasen, Nitish Kumar Reddy carved his own niche for Sunrisers Hyderabad in IPL 2024. In 11 innings with the bat, Nitsh averaged a little less than two sixes per innings to hit a total of 21 maximums. Striking at over 140, he scored 303 runs while averaging 33.66. He did not have the best of the season with the ball, managing only three scalps in seven innings. Nonetheless, the youngster showed glimpses of a genuine fast-bowling all-round, a rare craft in India. His exploits with both bat and ball and his presence in the field led him to become the Emerging Player of the Season. Sunrisers Hyderabad’s Abhishek Sharma.| Photo Credit:Deepak KR/The Hindu Among many left-handers who had an impressive IPL 2024 campaign, Abhishek Sharma tops them all by a fair margin. The 23-year from Punjab recorded the fastest half-century for SRH in just 16 deliveries, equalling the record of his opening partner Travis Head against Mumbai Indians. He also had the most sixes (42) this season, while his 204.21 strike was the third-best after Jake Fraser-McGurk and M.S. Dhoni among players who have faced over 100 deliveries. The flamboyant Abhishek scored 484 runs in 16 innings with three half-centuries, with the highest score being 75 not out against Lucknow Super Giants. Kolkata Knight Riders’ Harshit Rana.| Photo Credit:Deepak KR/The Hindu Harshit Rana has had a roller-coaster season. After initially receiving criticism for his ‘flying kiss’ celebration, Rana was given a one-match ban and fined 100 per cent of his match fee for repeatedly violating the IPL Code of Conduct. However, the KKR pacer shut everyone down with his performance with the ball. In just 11 innings, Harshit picked 19 scalps and was the joint-fourth highest wicket-taker alongside his teammate Andre Russell. His fiery spell of 4-1-24-2 helped KKR bundle out SRH for a paltry score of 113 in the final in Chennai. Comments Related Topics",

The three-member panel of justices, headed by Justice Ado Birnin-Kudu, held that the petition was bereft of substance and accordingly dismissed. The tribunal held that the petitioners; the social Democratic Party (SDap) and its candidate, Murtala Ajaka, failed to prove the allegations of over-voting and non-compliance with the Electoral Act, 2022 in the petition. The panel, in a unanimous, decision held that all the witness evidence filed before it were incompetent and full of inconsistencies. It also agreed with the submissions of the respondents that the allegations of forgery raised in the petition were pre-election matter, which ought to have been raised 14 days after the documents were submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Kogi had, on Nov. 11, 2023, held its off-cycle election in which Ododo of the APC emerged winner beating his closest rival, Ajaka of the SDP with a wide margin. Ajaka, dissatisfied with the outcome of the election, had filed a petition before the tribunal, challenging Ododo’s victory. The case, which commenced in December 2023, came to its highest point on May 13 when SDP, Ajaka, APC, Ododo and INEC adopted their final written addresses, after which the tribunal reserved judgement in the petition. It would be recalled that INEC, Ododo and his party, APC, had prayed the tribunal to dismiss Ajaka and SDP’s petition in its entirety for being incompetent and lacking in merit. The trio had, through their lawyers; Chief Kanu Agabi, SAN; Joseph Daudu, SAN and Emmanuel Ukala, SAN, respectively, had told the tribunal so while adopting their final written addresses and presenting their arguments against the petition. However, Ajaka’s lawyer, Pius Akubo, SAN, had urged the tribunal to discountenance the respondents’ submissions and uphold their petition. (NAN)",

        "content": "Steven Burridge is a mild-mannered trainer, but he can be quite the tough taskmaster to his jockeys, even after a win. As a former jockey, the veteran trainer is entitled to putting himself in his riders’ boots at times. The 69-year-old Australian would not only know the difference between winning and losing, but also winning better. Krisna Thangamani was at the receiving end of such a spray two weeks earlier. He did steer Galaxy Bar to a 11⁄4-length win in a Class 5 1,600m race on May 12, but the ride did not look the prettiest. After hunting up the Thronum four-year-old to fight for the lead with A Better Tomorrow, they still kicked clear in the straight. “The horse had no luck the other day. He was doing all the work,” said Burridge. “I told Krisna to lead if he could, but to take a seat if someone was quicker, but not to dig him up.” Nine times out of 10, when horses are forced to travel one-off throughout, they would fizzle out in the home straight, especially for a Class 5 performer, but Galaxy Bar kept building towards an impressive win. At the dismount, Burridge thanked the Malaysian lightweight jockey, but also let him know he got away with murder. But the fair man, who also races Galaxy Bar, is not ungrateful either. He still put Krisna back on when Galaxy Bar stepped up in grade to the $50,000 Class 4 1,800m event on May 25. It is just that the pre-race instructions took a little longer in the parade ring this time. “I told him not to do what he did at the last win. He rode him perfectly today,” said Burridge. “For sure, the good barrier (three) helped, but he did the right thing to sit outside the leader (Nature Chief) without doing much work.” Odds-on favourite Smart Star had every chance when he was set alight at the 500m, but the three-wide trip probably told on him late. He kept finding for Bernardo Pinheiro, but Galaxy Bar never faltered, to hold half-a-length on Smart Star at the wire. Nature Chief (Koh Teck Huat) kept plugging away for third place, another 11⁄4 lengths away. The winning time was 1min 48.85sec on the long course. Instead of being smug about the two wins in a row, Krisna humbly accepted his mistake at the first win. “Last time, he was pulling a bit with horses close to him. He still won, but Mr Burridge told me what I did wrong,” said Krisna. “Today he had a good barrier, and there were no horses to challenge him. “Before the race, Mr Burridge just told me to go forward, but to keep him beside a horse if he can’t. “He had a light weight (51kg), which also helped, but he has also improved. He can go over even longer.” Burridge has not plotted any long-term path for the four-time winner, but was just glad to savour his lone winner of the day. From his team of 11 runners, Flying Fighter was regarded as his best chance to salute (he lost) but, statistically, many thought Galaxy Bar’s race was his next best. After David Kok’s Vittoria Perfetta was scratched, Burridge saddled half the race with four runners in a field of eight. He also had Jungle Cruise (fifth), Screen Shot (sixth) and Split Second (last). He laughed off any notion he was even-money for a win. “The other three were also in good shape, but Galaxy Bar was one of my better chances. It’s worked out well,” he said. “I thought he did a good job to win again. He’s an up-and-coming horse and was up in Class 4 but he can stay.” manyan@sph.com.sg",

        "description": "Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina reveiled that has turned quite a few heads across South Asia by her stunning revelations at an all party meeting at her official residence in Dhaka on Sunday.",
        "content": "Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has stated that an ongoing conspiracy to \"carve out a Christian country\" from parts of Bangladesh and Myanmar is allegedly underway, the Daily Star reported on Sunday. Hasina went on to claim that, according to a \"white man\" who met with her before the January 7 election, she would face \"no problem\" if she allowed an unnamed country to build an airbase on Bangladeshi territory. \"It may appear that it [the plot] is aimed at only one country, but it is not. I know where else they intend to go,\" Bangladesh's prime minister stated, without specifying the name of the country. Commenting on her remarks, Hasina's former advisor Iqbal Sobhan Chowdhury told Sputnik India that the politician's statements were well thought out. Hasina won her fourth consecutive term this January. The vote was boycotted by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which demanded that the election be held under a caretaker set-up, a demand not in line with the nation's constitution. Significantly, the US was widely perceived to be batting for the BNP in the lead-up to the vote , though the two governments have since attempted to move on from the tensions created by the elections. While Hasina didn't name which nation was purportedly trying to create a Christian state from parts of Bangladesh and Myanmar, officials from her Awami League party have left little doubt as to who the premier is hinting at. Squadron Leader (retired) Sadrul Ahmed Khan , a member of the Awami League's finance and planning affairs sub-committee , shared with Sputnik India that it was clear that the US has been trying to make inroads in the South Asian region through its support for anti-government forces , which include the National Unity Government (NUG) and People's Defence Forces (PDF). The Awami League official pointed out that since last year, the Biden administration has made no secret of its support to the opposition forces in Myanmar after the US president signed the BURMA Act into law, which calls to provide \"non-lethal assistance\" for Myanmar's \"Ethnic Armed Organizations\". The first tranche of aid under the act reached anti-government forces this year. It has been objected to vociferously by the ruling State Administration Council (SAC), which stated, according to Voice of America (VOA), that \"the US is manipulating Myanmar to counter China's influence in the region.\" In fact, Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh claimed in February that the \"unnatural growth\" of Chin-Kuki-Zo tribes has implications for national security. The north-eastern Indian state has been experiencing ethnic clashes between the majority Meiteis and Kuki-Zo groups since last May, leading to over 200 deaths and tens of thousands of people being internally displaced. Indian Home Minister Amit Shah told parliament in January that New Delhi would fence the entire stretch of the 1,643-kilometre-long Indo-Myanmar border in response. Chowdhury, meanwhile, highlighted that improved India-Bangladesh relations under Hasina, including on security matters, have benefitted India's northeast. Furthermore, Khan stated that the US has sought to set up a base on St. Martin Island, strategically located at the Bangladesh-Myanmar maritime border in the Bay of Bengal, for a long time. He asserted that neither Bangladesh supports any arms race between the US and China nor would it act as a \"proxy\" for US interests aimed at containing China, because the independent state has its own outlook for the Indo-Pacific. He echoed Hasina and underlined that the country will not compromise in the face of external pressure. Chowdhury, in turn, warned that another US base in South Asia would have security implications not only for Dhaka but also for New Delhi.",

        "content": "NEW DELHI, May 27: Northwestern and central parts of the country are likely to get some relief from scorching heat after three days due to a fresh western disturbance, the Meteorological Department said on Monday. According to IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, Rajasthan and Gujarat saw nine to 12 heat wave days, with temperatures reaching 45-50 degrees Celsius. “Expect relief from the heat wave in northwest and central parts of the country after three days due to a western disturbance and moisture incursion from the Arabian Sea. There could be some thunderstorm activity in northwest India and rain in the western Himalayan region,” Mohapatra said in a virtual press conference. Delhi, south , southwest UP and recorded five to seven heat wave days, with maximum temperatures ranging from 44 degrees Celsius to 48 degrees Celsius, he said. Assam also experienced a heat wave with record-breaking temperatures on May 25-26. The IMD attributed the heat wave in northwest India and some parts of the central region in the second half of May to the lack of rainfall, stronger dry and warm winds and an anti-cyclonic circulation over southwest Rajasthan and adjoining Gujarat. Mohapatra said only two of the five western disturbances that affected north India were active.",

The Italian, 44, has emerged as the frontrunner to replace Mauricio Pochettino after guiding the Foxes to promotion . Meanwhile, Manchester United have completed their first bit of transfer business this summer, with Alvaro Fernandez moving to Benfica for £5million. BEST FREE BET SIGN UP OFFERS FOR UK BOOKMAKER S Follow all the latest news, moves and completed deals below ... Afam Lallana is holding talks with Southampton over a stunning return to St Mary's after his former club's Premier League promotion. The 36-year-old was spotted in the Royal Box at Wembley cheering his old team on as he prepares to become a free agent with his contract at Brighton running out on June 30. According to The Telegraph , the playmaker is already in the frame to come back to the Hampshire outfit a decade after his departure. That would make the former England international Russell Martin's first Premier League signing ahead of next season. Chelsea have requested official permission to speak to Enzo Maresca. The Blues have asked the Championship title winners to speak to their boss about becoming their new manager. Sun Sport understands that Maresca is close to leaving Leicester with talks between him and Chelsea at an advanced stage. Todd Boehly and Clearlake will have to pay £10m compensation to get their man. Manchester United and Arsenal are targeting Rennes wonderkid Desire Doue ahead of the summer transfer window. According to The Mail , United and the Gunners have both asked about the playmaker and that could spark an intense bidding war. Rennes will demand over £35million with substantial add-ons from his suitors this summer. As the Ligue 1 side have attracted interest from also Tottenham, Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich, Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Dortmund. Spain have announced their provisional squad for this summer’s Euro 2024. Premier League stars Rodri, David Raya and Marc Cucurella were selected but there was no place for Tottenham Hotspur defender Pedro Porro and Aston Villa's Pau Torres. Barcelona stars Pau Cubarsi, Lamine Yamal and Fermin Lopez were all included But Pablo Gavi missed out as he continues to recover from his anterior cruciate ligament injury. Ex-Newcaslte and Stoke ace Joselu who was in Real Madrid's Champions League semi-final was also picked for the squad. Arsenal captain Leah Williamson has signed a new deal with his childhood side. The defender, 27, has made 232 appearances since making her debut on her 17th birthday in March 2014. After being part of Arsenal's youth programme from the age of nine, Williamson debuted for the senior team as a teenager at the end of their 2014 Champions League campaign. With Arsenal, Williamson has won the League once and the FA Cup and League Cup twice each. Chelsea are set to announce their successor to Mauricio Pochettino this week, according to The Athletic . Kieran McKenna is out the race the report understands. Meaning Leicester City’s Enzo Maresca, Brentford’s Thomas Frank and former Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi are now in a three-horse Chelsea race. The search is being led by co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart alongside owners Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali. Luton have put together a brutal clearout following their Premier League relegation that has seen a total of 14 players leaving Kenilworth Road. The Hatters finished 18th in the Prem table with six points separating them from safety and will be returning to the Championship just a year after their stunning promotion. The released Luton stars are: Man City's summer transfer kitty will receive a £20million boost thanks to Southampton’s promotion to the Prem. Saints had an agreement that they will be obligated to buy centre back Taylor Harwood-Bellis if they went straight back up. And a £20million fee was agreed between the two clubs when he moved to the South Coast back in September. With Harwood Bellis coming through the ranks at the Etihad, it means it will be classed as pure profit for City and will help them to meet Profit and Sustainability Rules. The 22-year-old has previously had loan spells with Blackburn, Burnley and Stoke as well as Belgian club Anderlecht but will now become a Southampton player. The funds should help Pep Guardiola as he looks to strengthen his squad for their title defence next season. Crysencio Summerville could be set to leave Leeds this summer. The Whites suffered heartbreak in the play-off final at Wembley, where they were beaten by Southampton 1-0. Liverpool and Newcastle have both been linked with the forward in recent times. The Dutchman was named the EFL Player of the Season this year. According to TuttoJuve, Tottenham want to buy Ederson. Not City's Ederson... this Atalanta's Ederson, a Brazilian midfielder who starred against Bayer Leverkusen in the Europa League final. A fee of £35million has been touted for the 24-year-old. Previously, the Mirror claimed Newcastle were also interested. NORWICH are set to appoint Nordsjaelland boss Johannes Hoff Thorup as their new manager. The 35-year-old is in line to replace David Wagner, who was sacked after the Canaries’ 4-0 play-off defeat at Leeds this month. Thorup took charge of what may turn out to be his final Danish Superliga game yesterday, a 1-1 draw at Copenhagen. And the Dane was quizzed about the Carrow Road job but kept tight-lipped. He said: “Have I heard anything from Norwich? “As I’ve said several times, when I’m employed somewhere I have so much respect for them. “Just look at this scenery behind me right now. It would be disrespectful to talk about other clubs or other situations. “No matter if it was close or completely miles away — I’m never ever going to go into that. “This club means so much that we shouldn’t be standing here on the last day of the season talking about everything else.” Four clubs are trailing Arsenal's out of favour youngster Emile Smith Rowe. Wolves, Aston Villa, Everton and Crystal Palace are all credited with an interest in the midfielder. Reports in Spain add that Newcastle are no longer the frontrunners for Smith Rowe. Discussions about his future are said to be had soon. Mason Greenwood released a 52-word statement on his future as Getafe fans begged him to stay with a new chant. Greenwood’s future remains unclear as he enters the final year of his United contract. But the forward sent a message to fans as he posted a statement on social media. It read: “Incredibly grateful to the Getafe family and fans for an amazing season. “Thank you for making me feel welcomed and one of your own. I enjoyed every second, alongside my teammates and club. “A bitter sweet ending, but it was a pleasure to play for you, I wish you all the best.” Monumental news from Manchester City where it appears that Pep Guardiola is heading for his final 12 months at the Etihad. The City boss' deal is up in 2025 and it appears as if he will NOT sign a new deal. After the most successful period in the club's history - and one of the most dominant periods in English football - City are now heading into an extremely uncertain future. Man Utd confirmed they have completed their first bit of transfer business of the summer. Alvaro Fernandez, 21, has joined Benfica for £5million after spending the second half of the season on loan in the Portuguese capital. The Spain U21 left-back joined United aged 17 having spent time in the academies of Real Madrid and Deportivo La Coruna. He never made a senior appearance for the Red Devils. Mauricio Pochettino and Thomas Frank have reportedly held talks with Manchester United over the manager's job. However, the Telegraph does not make it clear if these discussions were had before or after Erik ten Hag won a second trophy in two seasons. Sir Jim Ratcliffe was expected to sack the Dutchman after the FA Cup final - but the brilliant performance in the 2-1 win may force him into a U-turn. United fans appear keen for Ten Hag to stay and may force the billionaire's hand. Man City earned £20million from the Championship play-off final. That's because Southampton's promotion meant the Saints triggered an obligation-to-buy clause for Taylor Harwood-Bellis. The fee for the defender was agreed when he switched to the South Coast on loan last September. Harwood-Bellis, 22, played in 45 games in all competitions this season and played the full 90 minutes as Southampton beat Leeds to win promotion back to the Premier League. Chelsea have reportedly added Roberto De Zerbi to the list of managers they are chasing. The Italian is now without a club after quitting Brighton at the end of the season. Ipswich’s Kieran McKenna, Leicester’s Enzo Maresca and Brentford’s Thomas Frank are all on the shortlist. Now, De Zerbi has reportedly been added say the Standard. The Blues are set to launch a £20million bid for Burnley goalie James Trafford. Chelsea signed Robert Sanchez and Djordje Petrovic last summer, but both have failed to establish themselves at Stamford Bridge. Now, the former Man City youth star could be set to challenge for the No1 spot. Trafford was selected by Gareth Southgate in the provisional Euro 2024 squad. A new Premier League club have entered the race to sign Michael Olise. The Crystal Palace winger is in demand - with the likes of Arsenal, Man Utd and Chelsea all in the hunt for the French wideman. Now, Newcastle are said to have declared their interest too. The Daily Mail claim the Toon have made Olise a priority this summer. Kylian Mbappe still hasn't announced his new club yet. The PSG star is leaving the club in the summer, and is expected to join Real Madrid. Asked why, he said: \"Because I think that the best thing to do is to finish these goodbyes. \"I think all I wanted was to finish well with my club. There's a trophy. I think there's a time for everything. \"I'll announce my new club in due course. I think we're just a few days away, so there's no problem.\" Ivan Toney is set to move this summer. But where is his likely destination? Betfair have provided the latest odds. Arsenal - 13/8 Tottenham - 7/2 Chelsea - 5/1 Man United - 13/2 West Ham - 13/2 Newcastle - 17/2 Nottingham Forest are braced for a bidding war for Callum Hudson-Odoi when the transfer window opens next month. Tottenham Hotspur lead a three-way chase for the 23-year-old who signed off for the season with three goals in Forest's final three games. Ange Postecoglou sees the pacy frontman as a perfect fit for his attack-minded Spurs side but faces competition from at least two other Premier rivals. Forest want to keep Hudson-Odoi but must complete at least one major sale by the end of June to avoid breaching Profit and Sustainability rules again. Philippe Coutinho is closing in on an Aston Villa exit. The Brazilian playmaker, 31, has failed to establish himself after arriving at Villa Park from Barcelona . And according to Fabrizio Romano , former club Vasco da Gama are confident of bringing him home after \"advanced talks\". Coutinho has flown out to his homeland and told local media \"everyone already knows\" where his future lies. He was snapped up by Steven Gerrard in 2022 in what was hailed as a potential game-changing signing. But the former Liverpool sensation has managed just six goals and three assists in 43 outings for the Villans. Arsenal prospect Albert Sambi Lokonga is keen to leave the club. The midfielder, 24, was once touted as the next Yaya Youre by compatriot Vincent Kompany. But he struggled for game time with the Gunners since arriving from Anderlecht in 2021 and spent last season on loan with relegated Luton .

Her told BBC Three Counties Radio: \"I had a discussion with Arsenal and the conclusion was the best thing for me was to leave the club, so now it’s up to my agent and the club to find something. \"I still have a contract there, one year plus a one-year option so let’s see what happens.\"",

        "description": "EU, US, UK raise concerns at WTO; New Delhi says rise is due to inflation",
        "content": "By Amiti Sen Comments READ LATER India’s farm input subsidies, including sops for fertilizers, electricity and irrigation, have increased a sharp 50 per cent to $48.13 billion in 2022-23 from $32.07 billion in the previous fiscal, per notifications made by the country at the WTO. This prompted several countries such as the EU, the UK and the US, to raise concerns and call for greater transparency at a recent peer group review meeting of the WTO, according to officials. “New Delhi explained that the input subsidies are mainly for power, irrigation and fertilizers, and that the increase was due to inflation and rising costs of fertilizers. It further said that the country had duly notified the information to the WTO,” a Geneva-based official told businessline . Agricultural input subsidies, targetted towards low income and resource poor farmers, are exempt from limits on domestic subsidies under the carve-out of special & differential treatment measures offered to developing nations under WTO rules. India opposes US, Australia allegations on its sugar subsidies breaching WTO limits EU’s deforestation law that could hit Indian exports opposed by many WTO members “The US pointed out that India’s input subsidies were more than twice the value of all trade-distorting support notified by the US in 2021-22. It raised concern on both the scale of India’s input subsidies and the rapid increase in expenditures,” the official said. New Zealand, Canada and the US expressed dissatisfaction with the explanation provided by India and said that it was not sufficient. “The countries said that India should be more transparent about the increase in expenditure,” the official added. Brazil and Japan, too, raised concerns on the matter. As India has declared that 99.43 per cent of farm holdings in the country are of low-income or resource poor farmers (per the Agricultural Census for 2015-16), its input subsidies are excluded from capping. “There is more peer group scrutiny on input subsidies also because it is not capped and can be increased without limits,” the official said. While several WTO members are trying to initiate negotiations on reforming all pillars of the Agreement on Agriculture, India has so far stoutly ruled out discussions around capping input subsidies on the ground that it was vital to ensure food and livelihood security of marginal farmers and for rural development. Instead, India, together with several developing nations, has been pushing developed nations to cut down on their special subsidy entitlements (extra Additional Measurement of Support) that allows them to give extra subsidies over the limits set in the AoA.

        "content": "Delhi Fire Department Director Garg suspects a \"electric fault\" to be a possible reason behind the fire that killed six babies at New Born Baby Care Hospital in Delhi's Vivek Vihar. Speaking with news agency ANI on Monday, Garg said, \"...it seems that there is no reason behind the fire other than an electric fault. This could only be seen as a possible reason as of now.\" He said more details will come out after analysing videos and statements by eyewitnesses as the investigation has been started. At least in Delhi's Vivek Vihar on Saturday night. According to a report, seven dead children, of which four male and three female newborn babies, were moved to the GTB Hospital for postmortem. What could have saved more children Garg told ANI that \"No one was there to guide us and no one could give us information regarding stairs and the number of cylinders...,\" the Delhi Fire Department Director said. Lapses The Delhi Police also pointed towards major lapses that led to the in the Vivek Vihar fire incident on Saturday. The Delhi Police's probe revealed that the license on which the hospital was operating was no longer valid. \"We came to know that the NOC [No Objection Certificate] of the hospital had expired on March 31,\" police told news agency ANI. Delhi police also said there was no emergency or fire exit system in the hospital premises. Deputy Commissioner of Police, Shahdara, Surendra Chaudhary said that the hospital had permission for up to five beds but they installed more than 10 beds. Police investigation further revealed that some of the doctors in the hospital were not qualified to treat a newborn child in need of Neo-Natal Incentive care, as they are BAMS degree holders only. Two accused, identified as Dr Naveen Khichi (45), who is the owner of the hospital, and Dr Akash (26), were arrested in connection with the fire incident. Police said they added Sections 304 and 308 of the Indian Penal Code in the FIR . \"One of the doctors who was on duty, Dr Akash, has also been arrested. The accused have 3 such clinics in Delhi,\" police told ANI. 'Fire safety equipment now compulsory in every hospital' In view of the incident, Delhi Health Minister Saurabh Bhardwaj said on Monday that fire safety equipment will be made compulsory in every hospital irrespective of its size. He said that earlier the NOC related to fire safety was not required for all those nursing homes which were restricted to the ground or first floors. \"That's why this hospital did not have NOC,\" he said. \"But now we have decided every hospital be it ground or the first floor or even above it, fire safety equipment will be necessary. There should be a water sprinkling system and automatic smoke detection,\" Saurabh Bhardwaj said at a press conference.

        "description": "Wendy's food is impressively inexpensive, and we're here to break down why, from high sales volume to a committment to avoiding food wastage.",
        "content": "Wendy's is known for its fresh food. Its burgers are never frozen, and its salads are made in-house everyday. Despite this approach, the food at Wendy's remains inexpensive; in fact, the fast food chain offers one of the cheapest menus out there. How can this be? There are several reasons why the food at Wendy's is so inexpensive — and in this article, we reveal them all. Wendy's boasts more than 6,500 restaurants, each of which marries fresh food with low prices. Maintaining and improving the profitability of these restaurants is the key to Wendy's success. Having low prices both helps and hinders this goal; low prices improve sales while simultaneously reducing profit margins. The chain has several ways of ensuring it continues to make money; these include maximizing sales volume, embracing new technology, and limiting food waste. These tactics — and many more — all contribute to the low price of your beloved Biggie Bag. Let's take a closer look at them. Wendy's pays low wages Labor is always one of a business' largest expenses. This is just as true for Wendy's as it is for every other fast food restaurant. That being said, Wendy's does limit its expenditure on labor by paying its staff low wages. Back in 2022, several Wendy's workers shared their salaries on a Reddit thread. Nearly all of those who commented, including managers, were paid no more than $15.50 per hour. Many crew members reported starting the job on as little as $11 per hour. A survey conducted by backs up this information. After receiving reports of 6,463 salaries, Indeed estimated the average crew member's wage to be $12.56 per hour. For comparison, estimated that the crew member wage at McDonald's is just over $13 per hour. Even saving $0.50 per crew member adds up to a huge amount over the course of an entire year. These savings are directly reflected in the restaurant's low prices. To put it simply, Wendy's can afford to price its food so inexpensively because it is paying its workers less than some competing companies. Wendy's has embraced automation Wendy's has always embraced automation and is often among the first fast food brands to introduce new technology into its stores. In the past, this has included being one of the first brands to introduce drive-thrus to its restaurants – — as well as self-order kiosks and its own app. All three have increased sales while driving down Wendy's operating costs, ensuring that food prices remain low. In 2023, Wendy's announced it was experimenting with that takes customers' orders. The chatbot was designed to streamline the ordering process, thus maximizing an already incredibly profitable aspect of Wendy's business model. Not only is the chatbot supposed to make ordering quicker, it also leaves staff members free to perform other tasks. This further drives Wendy's sales and profitability, thus enabling it to maintain the characteristically low prices of its food. Finally, the chatbot has been programmed to maximize sales via upselling. If successful, this could increase the profit margin associated with each order. These comfortable profit margins further ensure that Wendy's can afford to keep the prices of certain foods incredibly low. Wendy's relies on large sales volume All companies that serve or sell a product have to decide whether to prioritize sales volume or profit margin. Wendy's, like nearly all fast food chains, leans more towards large sales volume. Essentially, this means that Wendy's business model is designed to sell very large quantities of food at low prices. The idea behind this is that even small profit margins yield a lot of money when hundreds or thousands of items are sold each and every day. Drive-thrus have become an essential means of boosting sales volume at Wendy's. In 2023, it was estimated that a staggering 80% of food orders came from the drive-thru. Drive-thrus also serve more customers; some fast food brands experience 10-15% higher volume at drive-thrus than at the counter. Thanks to the sales volume both within the restaurant and at the drive-thru, Wendy's can maintain its inexpensive pricing. Wendy's underwent corporate reorganization Restructuring a company as large as Wendy's is no mean feat: It requires a lot of planning and money to be performed correctly. This did not stop Wendy's from embarking on a large-scale restructuring mission during 2023 that saw the size of the company's executive team reduced. Several senior positions were eliminated, including the role of the company's United States president. Estimates price the cost of the reorganization between $11 million to $13 million. Wendy's believes this is money well spent, and many agree. The company's operations are thought to be more efficient and its business model streamlined. Indeed, Wendy's has performed well since the reorganization, including a healthy start to 2024: The company's first quarter report revealed that sales had grown both internationally and in the United States. These strong sales reaffirm the company's decision to focus on large sales volume and subsequent growth. The new leadership team's success makes it very unlikely that this tactic will be changed. As a result, Wendy's prices are all but guaranteed to stay low. Wendy's balances out cheap food with premium options Wendy's is known for inexpensive food, but that doesn't mean it serves these foods. In fact, Wendy's menu also contains several premium options such as the Breakfast Baconator, a burger that's priced at $5.99 and . These premium foods play a very important role at Wendy's, subsidizing the inexpensive items and ensuring the brand remains profitable. An overreliance on the sale of inexpensive foods has seen Wendy's become unprofitable in the past. During the latter part of 2018, an overdependence on cheap foods saw some store sales decline. As reported in at the time, Wendy's ex-CEO Todd Penegor said, \"The opportunity we have is how not only to drive [customers] into the restaurants, but how to get them to mix in more core and premium items. We need to have that right balance between driving them in and trading them up.\" It might be perplexing to some, but the success of Wendy's premium foods is directly linked to the availability of Wendy's inexpensive foods. In recent years, Wendy's has done a better job of achieving this balance, and the brand is performing well. In other words, there's no danger of the restaurant brand prioritizing a high profit margin any time soon. Wendy's sells some products with high profit margins Interestingly, the best profit margins are not to be found in either Wendy's premium or value foods. Instead, the highest profit margins are associated with two specific products: drinks and French fries. It's thought that the profit margin for French fries served at Wendy's and other quick service restaurants lands anywhere between 75 and 90%. The margin on drinks, especially soda, is similarly impressive. Sales of these items are through the roof. In fact, were Wendy's most sold item during 2023, and Wendy's lemonade was the second most purchased beverage during the same year. The huge profits made on these two products allow Wendy's to sell other foods at very low prices. In essence, these two products subsidize Wendy's inexpensive foods. They even make up for the losses incurred by so-called loss leaders, foods that are kept on the menu even though the company loses money on them because they get customers in the restaurant. Wendy's leans into promotions and bundles Wendy's was the first fast food brand to offer a $0.99 value menu back in 1989. The company has continued to lean into promotions and bundles ever since. While a good deal for the customer, promotions such as the now-discontinued 4 for $4 and ever popular Biggie Bags remain profitable for Wendy's. In fact, senior members of the executive team have claimed these bundles and promotions actually boast better than average profitability. The reason why many of Wendy's promotions and bundles are so profitable is that they're made up of small portions. For example, the $5 Biggie Bag Meal Deal is comprised of junior fries, a four piece set of , a small drink, and a sandwich. These small portions minimize the cost of making the meal, thus allowing it to be profitable. Wendy's promotions and bundles are also known to boost sales. When the four for $4 promotion was introduced, the company saw sales increase by a significant margin in North America. As we've seen, Wendy's favors a high sales volume approach, which bundles and promotions actively support. Wendy's focuses on breakfast Breakfast is an especially lucrative part of the day for fast food chains such as Wendy's. This is partially thanks to the popularity of high profit margin foods at this time of day, most notably and coffee. Kirk Tanner, Wendy's CEO, highlighted another reason in an earnings call reported by . During it, Tanner said, \"We can grow our breakfast business significantly without adding incremental labor, which drives meaningful improvement of our restaurant economic model.\" The extra revenue brought in by breakfast is hugely important to how Wendy's operates throughout the rest of the day. As we've seen, products with a high profit margin subsidize the low costs of other foods sold by the brand. What's more, the company's breakfast is also another opportunity to push promotions and bundles that result in high sales volume. This is exemplified by the brand's recently launched $3 breakfast deal. Wendy's wastes very little food Every piece of food that Wendy's orders in has to be paid for. Unsurprisingly, this means that Wendy's is loath to waste food, especially high cost items such as meat. What makes this challenging is Wendy's commitment to only serving fresh, never frozen beef. The main way Wendy's minimizes beef wastage is using unserved patties to make the brand's chili. This ensures that even leftover food is monetized, giving the company the breathing room needed to price its food competitively. Another way Wendy's reduces food waste is reusing excess Frosty mixture the next day. Again, this cuts down on unnecessary waste, reduces the company's losses, and protects its profit margin. Of course, reducing food waste is not only an economic choice, but an environmental one too. Wendy's has committed to reducing food loss and waste by 50% by 2030. Not all of these practices have been adopted with maintaining the company's low prices in mind. Some, including donating excess food and repurposing cooking oil, are being performed to boost the company's sustainability credentials.",

        "content": "Taoiseach Simon Harris has stated that \" cost of living must once again be a focus for Budget 2025\". However, these expectations were quickly quelled by Finance Minister Michael McGrath who stated that the focus should be on \"permanent changes\" rather than a \"large series of one-off measures\". The comments were made at the National Economic Dialogue at Dublin Castle. This is the starting point of the budgetary process each year. It brings politicians and interest groups together to discuss the Budget. The Summer Economic Statement will be published following \"four to six weeks\" of \"extensive engagement with the party leaders\". This outlines how much money will be spent as part of the Budget. Read more: Over €500,000 worth of contraband seized from parcels at Dublin premises Read more: Dublin weather: Met Eireann forecast dry and bright conditions leading up to bank holiday weekend Despite speculation at the weekend that there may be an early Budget to allow for an early election, Minister McGrath stated that Budget 2025 will take place at the normal time, which is in the first two weeks of October. In his opening remarks, Mr Harris said that \"cost-of-living increases have left them feeling their personal finances are insecure and might not withstand any further shocks\". \"Therefore I believe the cost of living must once again be a focus for Budget 2025, building on the cost-of-living measures in the previous two years,\" the Taoiseach said. \"Therefore I believe the cost of living must once again be a focus for Budget 2025, building on the cost-of-living measures in the previous two years. \"In the coming Budget, we must ensure we provide the extra funding required to keep pace with the expanding population and a cost-of-living and welfare package that protects the most vulnerable. Income tax bands and credits must again be properly indexed so that people do not drift into the higher rate band of income tax.\" Minister McGrath said that \"of course, there will be measures in the Budget to support households with the cost of living\" but stated that we \"are in a different place when it comes to inflation\" and \"the emphasis should be on further measures and permanent changes to our expenditure and taxation framework rather than a large series of one-off measures.\" He told the Irish Mirror, however, that the looming general election will not have any influence on him or Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe when it comes to making decisions. He said: \"Overall, the economy is in good health. If you look back to where we were at this point last year, when we stood here, inflation was much higher. There was a lot of uncertainty as to whether or not it was going to be possible to get inflation down without doing considerable damage to the economy and to the labour markets. \"Thankfully, by working together, by careful management, we have avoided that. We are likely to be at a turning point in the interest rate cycle. We expect further energy price reductions to be passed through the wholesale level to the retail level.\" Mr Harris also said during his speech that spending extra money on services does not necessarily lead to better outcomes. \"If it was just about writing another cheque, many of the challenges society faces would no longer exist,\" he continued. \"So often, our political discourse defending itself descends into some sort of transactional bidding war, who is going to give another fiver here or another fiver there.\" For all the latest news from Dublin and surrounding areas visit our homepage .

        "description": "The storms threaten to bring more violent weather to other areas.",
        "content": "Powerful storms have killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas. The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the north-west corner of Arkansas, and the system threatened to bring more violent weather to other areas. By Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swathe of the country from Alabama to near New York City. Kentucky governor Andy Beshear has declared a state of emergency in a post on social media platform X, citing “multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes”. Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado ploughed through a rural area near a mobile home park on Saturday night, Texas governor Greg Abbott said at a news conference. The dead included two children, aged two and five. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff. Storms also killed two people and destroyed houses in Oklahoma, where the injured included guests at an outdoor wedding, eight people in Arkansas and one person in Kentucky. Tens of thousands of residents were without power across the region. In Texas, around 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, Mr Abbott said, speaking from near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest-hit, with winds reaching an estimated 135mph, officials said. “The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,” said Mr Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts of severe weather, including storms that killed eight people in Houston. Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the car park. “A firefighter came to check on us and he said, ‘You’re very lucky,’” Mr Parra said. “The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.” Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas. No more deaths are expected and nobody was reported missing in Texas, Mr Abbott said, though responders were doing one more round of searches just in case. Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference on Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity. The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county’s emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said. In Kentucky, a man was killed on Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed on social media it was a storm-related death.",

Some of those killed were displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire. Many were women and children. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas. Even some of its closest allies like the United States are expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel says it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts. One of those courts last week demanded that Israel halt its offensive in Rafah. EU-Israel relations take a nosedive as Spain, Ireland set to formally recognize a Palestinian state BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel took a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain. Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah while Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including the leader of Hamas. Latest deadly weather in US kills at least 20 as storms carve path of ruin across multiple states VALLEY VIEW, Texas (AP) — Powerful storms have killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas. The storms obliterated homes and destroyed a truck stop where drivers took shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park. Eight people were killed in Arkansas. Three died in Kentucky, and two were killed in Oklahoma. Tens of thousands of residents were without power across the region. Papua New Guinea says Friday's landslide buried more than 2,000 people and formally asks for help MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A Papua New Guinea government official has told the United Nations more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive by a landslide Friday. The official formally asked for international help. The government figure is roughly triple a U.N. estimate of 670 killed in the landslide in the South Pacific island nation’s mountainous interior. In a letter seen by The Associated Press to the United Nations resident coordinator dated Sunday, the acting director of the South Pacific island nation’s National Disaster Center Luseta Laso Mana said the landslide “buried more than 2000 people alive” and caused “major destruction” at Yambali village in the Enga province. Estimates of the casualties have varied widely. Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms in Trump hush money trial WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. Perhaps Wednesday, before the jury begins deliberations, the judge is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case. China has threatened trade with some countries after feuds. They're calling 'the firm' for help WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. State Department has set up an eight-person team known as “the firm” to provide help to countries cut off from Chinese trade. The team emerged after Washington stepped in to help Lithuania when the northern European country found its cargo shipments to and from China stranded two years ago during a feud over Taiwan. State Department officials say Washington sees ”the firm” as an emergency response when a country fears facing economic pressure from China. The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. says Beijing opposes economic coercion and calls the American allegation “completely unfounded.\" Russian POWs get to make phone calls home. Ukrainians don't. A growing movement wants that to change FAR WESTERN UKRAINE (AP) — For hundreds of Russian soldiers taken prisoner, phone calls home can offer a bit of comfort and hope. It's a lifeline unavailable to Ukrainian POWs, whose families have gone without hearing their voices. Now, Ukrainian families of POWs are demanding an end to the calls to Russia. They're appealing a decision to block a petition that got more than 25,000 signatures. The families’ anger and the petition rejection come amid widespread reports of systematic mistreatment of Ukrainians in Russian captivity. Ukraine has regularly opened its main POW camp to the Red Cross, the U.N. and journalists. The Associated Press recently visited the western Ukraine site. It's a full day’s journey from the front lines. The visit took place on condition its location not be revealed. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030. Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance. Military labs do the detective work to identify soldiers decades after they died in World War II OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. (AP) — Generations of American families have grown up not knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones who died while serving their country in World War II and other conflicts. But a federal lab tucked away above the bowling alley at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha and a sister lab in Hawaii are steadily answering those lingering questions. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency experts strive to offer about 200 families annually the chance to honor their relatives with a proper burial. Advances in DNA technology, combined with innovative techniques including comparing bones to chest X-rays taken by the military, mean the labs can identify more of the missing soldiers every year.",

The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the north-west corner of Arkansas, and the system threatened to bring more violent weather to other areas. By Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swathe of the country from Alabama to near New York City. Kentucky governor Andy Beshear has declared a state of emergency in a post on social media platform X, citing “multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes”. Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado ploughed through a rural area near a mobile home park on Saturday night, Texas governor Greg Abbott said at a news conference. The dead included two children, aged two and five. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff. Storms also killed two people and destroyed houses in Oklahoma, where the injured included guests at an outdoor wedding, eight people in Arkansas and one person in Kentucky. Tens of thousands of residents were without power across the region. In Texas, around 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, Mr Abbott said, speaking from near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest-hit, with winds reaching an estimated 135mph, officials said. “The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,” said Mr Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts of severe weather, including storms that killed eight people in Houston. Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the car park. “A firefighter came to check on us and he said, ‘You’re very lucky,’” Mr Parra said. “The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.” Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas. No more deaths are expected and nobody was reported missing in Texas, Mr Abbott said, though responders were doing one more round of searches just in case. Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference on Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity. The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county’s emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said. In Kentucky, a man was killed on Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed on social media it was a storm-related death.",

        "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has arrived in Madrid where he is expected to sign a bilateral security agreement with Spain. The deal will help his country fight its more than two-year war with Russia amid a recent offensive by the Kremlin’s forces. Spain’s King Felipe VI met Mr Zelensky at the capital’s Barajas airport. The Ukrainian leader is holding talks with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez about what local media reported is a planned 1.1 billion euro (£940 million) agreement for Spain to supply Ukraine with more weapons. Mr Zelensky had been due to visit Spain earlier this month but he postponed all his foreign trips after the Kremlin’s forces launched a cross-border offensive in the north-eastern Kharkiv region and left Ukrainian troops reeling. A Western intelligence assessment suggested that Russia’s Kharkiv offensive has subsided. “The northern Kharkiv front has likely stabilised with Russian territorial control fragmented and not joined up,” the UK’s Ministry of Defence said. “Russia’s gains in this axis will be limited in the coming week, as Russia’s initial momentum has been contained by Ukrainian resistance.” That is in line with Mr Zelensky’s claim last Friday that Ukrainian forces have secured “combat control” of areas where Russian troops entered the Kharkiv region. The onslaught unfolding as the weather improves has brought Ukraine’s biggest military test since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Slow deliveries of support by its Western partners, especially a lengthy delay in US military aid, have left Ukraine at the mercy of Russia’s bigger army and air force. Spanish newspaper El Pais, citing unidentified sources familiar with the bilateral deal, said it would include another batch of US-made Patriot air defence systems that Ukraine has long pleaded for to help it fend off Russian missile attacks. Other items include more Leopard tanks for Ukraine and 155mm artillery shells that are the most used by Ukraine on the battlefield, El Pais said. Spain will also continue training Ukrainian troops and treating its wounded soldiers.",

        "content": "Sir, The traffic in Mysuru is going from bad to worse. The one-way streets like Kalidasa Road, Devaraj Urs Road etc., are full of two-wheelers, autos and cars coming in the wrong direction. People have not spared even the Ring Road where the wrong direction traffic is rampant. To make things even worse, we have lots of stray cattle roaming on the busy roads which is a major hazard since it becomes very difficult to spot the dark coloured cows in the night. I would like to mention here that wearing helmets and fastening seat belts have gone to dogs. We also regularly come across 3-4 people riding on two-wheelers. It’s high time that the Traffic Police start looking into the above offenders as their job seems to have boiled down to checking drink and drive offenders only. We have such a beautiful city with wide roads, less traffic etc. Let us not make a mess of it. – Shashi Kant Pai, Mysuru, 24.5.2024 You can also mail us your views, opinions, and stories to [email protected] Voice of The Reader",

        "content": "A turbodiesel variant of the Tank 300 is in the works due to ongoing global demand of the petrol or hybrid-powered retro-styled off-roader. Introduced four years ago, the oldest model of the Great Wall Motors ( GWM )-owned Tank brand has been motivated by either 2.0-litre turbocharged unit, or a 3.0-litre twin-turbo V6 introduced last year. Shared with P500 Locally, GWM South Africa has only made the former units available with the latter, for now, remaining exclusive to the People’s Republic where its powers the limited edition Tank 330 .

Despite no further details being divulged, the approval means the diesel engine Tank 300 will most likely develop the same 135kW/480Nm as the P500, delivered to the ground through a nine-speed automatic gearbox. Tank 500 next? While the move opens-up the possibility of the diesel being used in the Tank 500 SUV , no information was announced as sales in key oil-burning markets such as Australia and South Africa have yet to kick-off. Similar to the 300, the Tank 500 will only be powered petrol for South Africa , though solely with the HEV set-up that sends 255kW/648Nm to all four wheels through a hybrid optimised nine-speed automatic ‘box. More soon While an expected launch of the Tank 300 diesel remains unknown, expectations are it could well become a reality before the end of the year. As such, expect it to be a certainty for South Africa given not only the segment’s preference for diesel, but also the engine’s presence in the P500.

        "description": "Following complaints that private companies have taken over beaches and excluded the public, the government has started deploying drones to check possible violations of the rules.",
        "content": "Photo: Greek Ministry of Economy and Finance The Greek Ministry of Economy and Finance announced on Monday that the first drone inspections have begun to identify violations of rules governing use of the coast and beaches, including public right of access. “The ministry’s new strategy includes strict rules and intensive controls to ensure citizens’ free access to the beaches, the transparent use of public property, the protection of the environment, the upgrading of the tourist product and the respect and safety of bathers,” the ministry said on May 25. The first drone flights took place on May 24 at the beaches at Pefkohori and Polychrono in the region of Halkidiki, northern Greece, where there have been many complaints about access, said the ministry. In addition to drone flights, the ministry will use satellite images, citizens’ testimonies through the free app MyCoast, where they can file complaints, and on-spot audits organised by the ministry in collaboration with the real estate service, the Independent Authority of Public Revenue, Police and prosecution authorities and municipalities. Penalties start from fines and escalate to a ban on participation in auctions as well as suspension of business. Fines from 2,000 to 60,000 euros are envisaged for obstructing the public’s free access to the coast and the beaches. Criminal penalties are imposed for changes to the environment. Parliament voted in March a new law on the utilisation of public property in coastal areas. Environmental NGOs criticised it, saying that it allows for the commercial exploitation of beaches even in protected areas. “The new law significantly shrinks the public shared space of our coasts and fails to provide a guarantee of protecting sensitive ecosystems and shielding societies against the present threat of the climate crisis,” said WWF Greece. Last year, Greeks took to the streets to demand restoration of free public access to the country’s beaches as enshrined in the law. Large stretches of coastline have been taken by private businesses that illegally restrict access to beaches and frequently charge exorbitant sums for the rent of sunbeds. A protest movement, the so-called ‘Towel Movement’, began on the island of Rhodes and spread to the north of the country. The ministry has set up a new procedure for concessions in coasts and beaches through a special digital platform . By May 31, it is expected that all the electronic auctions for over 1,200 concessions will have been posted.",

        "description": "The water company says it's still not safe to drink the water at 2,500 properties without boiling it first.",
        "content": "South West Water (SWW) has issued an update as it fails to rid Brixham of its contaminated water nearly two weeks on from the parasite scandal in Devon. A boil notice remains in place for around 2,500 properties in Hillhead, upper parts of Brixham and Kingswear where drinking water remains unsafe to consume. It's after cryptosporidium, a microscopic parasite, was found in the water with a boil notice first issued on May 15. The bug caused dozens of people to fall ill with diarrhoea, stomach cramps and vomiting earlier this month with SWW still providing thousands of cases of bottled water as it works round the clock to fix the problem. SWW lifted the boil notice for the Alston supply area of Brixham covering 14,500 households over the weekend but more than 2,000 households are still impacted. The notice was initially put in place after the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) confirmed it is investigating cases of cryptosporidiosis, the infection caused by the cryptosporidium parasite, confirmed to have infected as many as 77 people .

        "content": "By Jay Lakhani, Co-Founder & Director, CHEMAXE The worldwide chemical sector, which is regarded as a vital actor in global manufacturing, is presently undergoing a significant shift due to the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology. This technology has the potential to transform industrial processes. The Internet of Things enables real-time monitoring and control, process optimisation, predictive maintenance support, and safety protocol enhancement. The potential of IoT to link numerous equipment and systems inside chemical plants can result in increased operational efficiency, lower downtime, and proactive risk management. This is a significant change in an industry known for its complexity and stringent restrictions. The chemical industry is confronted with various challenges that impede its financial success and growth. As stated in a study, the sector experiences staggering losses of $50 billion annually due to unexpected equipment malfunctions, resulting in downtime. Additionally, adhering to stringent regulatory requirements for safety and environmental impact poses an ongoing concern. Furthermore, the industry needs to prioritise enhancing inventory management and real-time manufacturing, which places significant pressure on maintaining accurate inventory levels and efficient supply chains. The combination of a network of sensors, actuators, and intelligent devices with cloud-based analytics offers an appealing answer to these problems. Chemical firms may use IoT to acquire real-time insights into their operations, allowing for better process monitoring. Sensors continually monitor critical parameters in reactors, pipelines, and other equipment, including temperature, pressure, flow rates, and vibration. This real-time data enables proactive modifications to improve manufacturing techniques, decrease waste, and maintain product quality. Predictive maintenance offers another advantage. By utilising IoT-powered analytics, anomalies in sensor data can be detected, foreseeing potential equipment failures before they occur. This enables proactive maintenance, ultimately decreasing unexpected downtimes and related costs. According to McKinsey’s statistics, it is projected that predictive maintenance facilitated by IoT will slash unplanned downtimes by 30–50%. Chemical plants frequently handle hazardous substances, emphasising the importance of safety. IoT sensors can monitor environmental parameters, detect leaks, and trigger automated safety measures during emergencies. This safeguards employees and mitigates environmental impacts. Two clear benefits of integrating IoT into stock control are real-time inventory tracking and faster operations. Companies may effectively manage their chemical inventory by adding RFID tags or intelligent sensors to tanks and containers. Just-in-time delivery and optimal ordering are made possible, and the requirement for manual stocktaking is removed, along with the possibility of stockouts. However, a significant planning is needed for an IoT deployment to be effective. Chemical firms need to determine their particular demands and then make investments in reliable IoT solutions that work well with their current setup. Furthermore, it is crucial to guarantee data security. To protect critical industrial data from hackers, it is essential to implement strong cybersecurity safeguards and secure communication methods. As a major step towards the “Industry 4.0” era, the chemical sector is undergoing a considerable transition with the incorporation of IoT technologies. Chemical firms may improve their production environment security, connectivity, and operational efficiency by utilising real-time data and cognitive analytics. This change encourages a culture of creativity and constant improvement in addition to increasing profitability for these businesses. Deeper integration of IoT in the chemical industry is being made possible by the continuous improvements in sensor technology and communication networks, which are laying the groundwork for a data-driven and sustainable future. However, certain issues need to be addressed. The initial cost of IoT equipment can be significant, and integrating sophisticated sensor networks takes expertise. Furthermore, issues about data privacy and cybersecurity must be addressed to guarantee that IoT solutions run smoothly and securely. Ultimately, the Internet of Things (IoT) presents revolutionary options that have the potential to improve the chemical sector dramatically. IoT has the power to transform operations, improve safety protocols, and provide chemical businesses with a major competitive advantage by providing real-time monitoring and intelligent inventory management. As technology advances, the chemical industry sees a future that is more dependent on data-driven insights, more ecologically conscious, and more productive and efficient. if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(\"script\"); s.async = true; s.type = \"text/javascript\";s.src = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js';var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());} var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];var abkw = window.abkw || '';var plc516228 = window.plc516228 || 0;document.write('');AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(182450, 516228, [728,90], 'placement_516228_'+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc516228++, keywords: abkw, domain: 'servedbyadbutler.com', click:'CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER' }});",

        "content": "Known as the “Pearl of Africa,” Uganda is a country abundant in technological potential as well as natural beauty. Innovative thinkers throughout the nation are creating solutions that could revolutionise regional economies and leave their imprint on the international scene. Uganda has witnessed a rise in technological innovation in recent times. Young entrepreneurs are utilising technology to tackle urgent issues, ranging from agritech to fintech. For example, innovators are building platforms to boost healthcare delivery, developing apps to increase agricultural output, and establishing mobile payment solutions specifically for the unbanked population. These firms have the potential to improve everyday living while also promoting economic growth and finding solutions to pressing problems. Though Uganda has a thriving digital ecosystem, companies have always found difficulty obtaining the funding they need to grow. Barbara Birungi Mutabazi, Co-founder and Executive Director of Hive Colab, one of the few firms that give the start-up / new company the much-needed visible identity to help promote their offerings and find funding or investment capital, informed Watchdog Uganda that most of the Startups in Uganda lack investment acumen because most developers don’t know who to present their business ideas before the funders. “Pitching a business is a different thing from sitting down and developing a certain tech solution and from my experience, I have seen many startups with very convincing ideas but can not present them before funders. That’s why here at HiveCalab we help our innovators and teach them how to pitch for business and how a business proposal must look because most Ugandan Startups lack what we call investment readiness. No investor will put their money in a firm that is not showing a green future because this is business and most developers tend to forget that,” she said. She also added that most of Ugandan startups often lack the global exposure that attracts international investors. Many potential funders are unaware of the innovative work being done in Uganda simply because it hasn’t reached their radar. “That’s why here at HiveColab play a pivotal role in nurturing Youth Startup Academy Uganda (YSAU) startups, shaping the next generation of tech entrepreneurs. The YSAU program is implemented in collaboration with the International Trade Centre, Korea SMEs and Startup Agency, and NITA Uganda. These partnerships provide a robust foundation for developing and scaling startup ventures. And with this innovators under this program have been able to participate on global platforms which helps them to pitch their businesses and also get exposed,” she added. Robert Bob Okello, Associate National Coordinator of YSAU, also added that across the globe investment readiness has always been and will always be the master key for any investor both local and international. “Our mission is to prepare startups for investor readiness and to position them on platforms where they can interact with regional and international investors. By participating in events like GITEX Africa in Marrakesh and similar events in Korea, we aim to expose our startups to the global stage. The success of the YSAU program in Korea, which has already produced two unicorns, inspires us to replicate this success in Uganda.” Micheal Niyitegeka, the director of Refactory Academy, a pioneer training academy in Uganda that offers alternative industry-led skilling for the global technology industry. Which is also focused on equipping learners with skills to enable them to venture into a Tech career of choice. Told Watchdog Uganda that while talent is abundant, the infrastructure to support tech startups – such as incubators, accelerators, and co-working spaces – is still developing. This can limit the growth and scalability of startups. Studies have also indicated that in times of economic recession or unpredictability, investors have exhibited heightened caution and risk aversion, thereby considerably affecting startups’ capacity to obtain capital. If general market conditions are unfavourable, even enterprises with good performance and bright futures may find it difficult to attract investment. Investors prioritise capital preservation, which makes them prefer safer, more established investments over startups with greater risk profiles. This is the driving force behind their cautious behaviour. Economic uncertainty also frequently leads to decreased liquidity, which means investors have less money to spend, which further restricts the quantity and amount of investments made in new businesses. However, Ugandan Startups can lessen their dependency on traditional venture capital by investigating a variety of funding options, including grants, crowdfunding, and strategic alliances, to overcome these obstacles. More robust funding sources can be created by bolstering regional investment ecosystems through the establishment of regional venture funds, angel investor networks, and government assistance. Furthermore, establishing international ties with foreign investors like how HiveColab is doing can reduce the influence of regional economic conditions and lead to new funding options. Even in times of economic uncertainty, businesses can increase their chances of getting the funding they need by utilising these tactics.",

        "content": "A coalition of ethnic nationalities under the aegis of the Atakar, Berom, Irigwe, Mwaghavwul And Ron Youths Associations In Conjunction With The Coalition Of Plateau indigenous youth bodies has raised the alarm over the forceful displacement and annexation of 151 indigenous hamlets, villages and communities as well as land grabbing In Plateau State by the Fulani. Chairman of Indigenous Youths, Mr Paul Dekete, while addressing a Press Conference alongside other tribal leaders, held at the NUJ Press Centre in Jos on Monday, expressed disappointment over the low level of response by governments over the years over their plight. The annexed communities according to them, are scattered in Bassa., Bokkos, Riyom, Barkin Ladi, and Mangu local government areas “In view of the unsatisfactory and feeble responses so far received from all levels of Government in Nigeria, the Atakar, Berom, Irigwe, Mwaghavwul and Ron Youths Associations in conjunction with the Coalition of Plateau Indigenous Youths Bodies are constraint to draw attention of the public and, especially, International Community through this Press Conference on the alarming and unacceptable loss of ancestral lands as well as the denial of access to farmlands and mining sites currently being suffered by the customary landowners in the State. “For several years to date, the youths’ bodies have been crying aloud and lodging complaints to appropriate authorities including the Nigerian Police Force, Department of State Security, Operation Safe Haven-OPSH, National Human Rights Commission, the National Assembly and others that there is a serious undercurrent to the unprecedented and well-orchestrated terror attacks unleashed on our hamlets, villages and communities with the principal motive of dispossessing us of our God-giving lands and territory. “The agenda and strategy of the Fulani terrorists are evidenced in attacks and killings on Hamlets, Villages and Communities thereby intimidating and displacing native inhabitants, leading to the disruption of their livelihoods, paving the way for the occupation of such lands and denial of access which consequentially produces ungoverned spaces and “NO-GO” areas for supposedly conquered peoples in this 21st Century. “From our collective Community experiences, we strongly believe there is a curious connection between the areas where our people have suffered the worse forms of displacement and denial of access to the rich natural and mineral endowment of such locations. It’s common knowledge that hamlets and villages in Barkin Ladi, Bassa, Bokkos Mangu and Riyom Local Government Areas are richly endowed with resources such as favourable weather conditions, natural tourist sites, fertile soils, water bodies, “Cassaterite, Columbite and so many other minerals. It’s instructive, therefore, to judiciously note the rapidly changing economic and occupational demographics in the occupied territories. For instance, in Gashish District of Barkin Ladi LGA, the Fulani have currently taken over the economic activities of the area, having largely displaced native farmers from their ancestral areas. “The exploitation and domination of the people is evidenced at local produce markets and transport businesses in and around the said Gashish District. “It’s quite provoking to imagine that the foundation of churches that were destroyed by these terrorist elements have overnight been reconstructed as Mosques to the utter disregard of the Fundamental rights of the displaced people. “A case in point is the Rankum (Mahanga) in Jol, Ranchos and Kak in Sopp, all in Riyom Local Government Area. The statement added, “For the avoidance of doubt, over 151 Hamlets and Villages are either totally “annexed” or effectively being occupied by the Fulani militants, bandits or terrorists in the Local above Government of Barkin Ladi, Bassa, Bokkos, Mangu and Riyom. Below is the list of the affected areas which can independently be verified. communities annexed by terrorists, bandits and Fulani militants in Plateau state.",

        "content": "SANDY, Utah ( ABC4 ) — A woman was taken into custody on Sunday, May 26, after allegedly killing her roommate at a Sandy medically vulnerable assistance facility. Laura Darlene Northrup, 60, was booked into the Salt Lake County Jail. She faces a first-degree felony murder charge as well as a third-degree felony charge for evidence tampering. According to a probable cause document, Northrup was staying at the Sandy Medically Vulnerable People Shelter, a former hotel that was recently renovated to house seniors, veterans and the medically frail experiencing homelessness. Northrup reportedly had two roommates at the shelter including the victim, identified as Stephanie Lynee Hackett Carrasco, 62. Police said Nothrup can be seen on video surveillance footage entering the shared room just before midnight on Saturday night. Meanwhile, Carrasco can be seen coming and going, moving items into the room between midnight and 1 a.m. on Sunday. Police said Carrasco can last be seen entering the room just after 1 a.m. and Northrup can be seen leaving just before 2 a.m. with an armful of clothing and personal items. The second roommate reportedly did not stay the night in the shared room and was not seen until about noon on Sunday when she returned to take a nap. The second roommate told police she didn’t notice anything amiss until she woke up several hours later and spotted Carrasco’s body face down “mostly underneath her own bed” and covered in bed sheets. Police and medical staff were called around 4:30 p.m. on Sunday and declared Carrasco dead at the scene. Medical personnel said Carrasco had an injury to the back of her dead “consistent with blunt force trauma.” An investigation into the alleged homicide is still in its early stages. According to the probable cause statement, detectives are searching for the suspected item used in the alleged murder as well as any other items with blood on it. A possible motive for the alleged murder was not disclosed in court documents. Northrup reportedly refused to make a statement with police and requested an attorney. Court documents show she is being held without bail, pending a pretrial hearing.",

        "description": "Great white sharks are returning to Cape Cod, and authorities are warning people flocking to the beach over the holiday weekend",
        "content": "Those who are choosing to spend their Memorial Day weekend at New England ’s beaches are being warned by officials that they may not be the only ones flocking to the shore, as signs of white sharks have been spotted in the waters. The New England Aquarium has warned beachgoers that there already has been harm to sea mammals in Massachussets within the water, thought to be the result of white sharks, they wrote in a press release. The aquarium said they have found multiple marine mammals with white shark bites off the coast of the state, and hundreds of seals sighted along the beaches. While no white sharks have yet been caught on camera, two of the animals were briefly seen from an aerial survey of Monomoy Island, the aquarium said. Last week, the aquarium received a report from a fishing charter company that they saw a minke whale with a white shark bite off the seaside town of Chatham, at the southeastern tip of Cape Cod in Massachusetts . John Chisholm, an adjunct scientist in the aquarium’s Anderson Cabot Center of Ocean Life, also captured images of a seal with fresh bite marks in Plymouth, around two hours away from the Chatham sighting on the other side of Cape Cod. “We know they’re here,” Mr Chisholm said. “With beach weather in the forecast and Memorial Day Weekend approaching, this is a good reminder for people to review shark safety guidelines and be shark smart.” Scientists usually expect to see white sharks at this time of year in the inshore waters of New England, where they return to hunt seals and other prey throughout the summer and into the fall. “We had a white shark eat a seal in front of some whale watchers this time last year,” Mr Chisholm added to CNN . “May is when white shark activity typically picks up, so it’s nothing out of the norm.” The scientist emphasized that beachgoers should be aware of the presence of sharks in shallow waters, and areas should be avoided where seals can be seen, or schools of fish are visible. Mr Chisholm added that people should also stay close to the shore, where emergency responders can access it easily if that is needed. \"These animals are very cautious, selective predators,\" Megan Winton with the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy told NBC Boston . \"They’re really good at what they do, and they don’t make mistakes that often, but if you are swimming in an area where large sharks are feeding on large prey, you know there’s an element of risk.\" Throughout the year, more than 15 shark species reside in the waters around New England, and researchers at the aquarium work on monitoring these marine animals using innovative tagging technologies, such as satellite and camera tags, to track the sharks throughout their lives. As for great white sharks, their numbers have increased on the Cape because of an equally growing seal population that is rebounding after being hunted to near extinction, the National Park Service says. The aquarium is asking members of the public to report any sightings on the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy’s Sharktivity app, which helps others to be informed about any detections and raises awareness of their dangers.",

        "content": "Colchester Council has thrown-out an application made by Jkr Restaurants and Sign Specialists Ltd for its new Wendy’s restaurant in High Street. The group wants to install a number of illuminated and non-illuminated signs depicting the brand's iconic image of the pigtailed, smiling girl. Colchester Civic Society objected to the plans, saying the bold signs would be “inappropriate” for the city centre. In a letter, the society stated: “The Colchester Civic Society object to the signage design and colour choice in the Conservation Area of our historic High Street. “It is our contention that these proposals are singularly inappropriate and we would contend that the applicant should reconsider the concept for this site. “We might suggest a discussion with the Planning Department regarding acceptable colour choices in particular and alternative design concepts for this area.” Bosses at Colchester Council have now refused the plans. They said: “The proposed signage would be a visually incongruous feature and would be harmful to public visual amenity, including the setting of the conservation and surrounding designated heritage assets\". The American fast food chain confirmed it was earlier this year, but an opening date is yet to be announced. Wendy's already has another restaurant at the Northern Gateway Park and in Chelmsford High Street, while another is planned in Southend.",

        "content": "The Kogi State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja, on Monday, affirmed the election victory of Gov. Usman Ododo of All Progressives Congress (APC)... By Daily Trust The Kogi State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja, on Monday, affirmed the election victory of Gov. Usman Ododo of All Progressives Congress (APC) in the November 11, 2023 poll. The three-member panel of justices, headed by Justice Ado Birnin-Kudu, held that the petition was bereft of substance and accordingly dismissed. The tribunal held that the petitioners; the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and its candidate, Murtala Ajaka, failed to prove the allegations of over-voting and non-compliance with the Electoral Act, 2022 in the petition. The panel, in a unanimous, decision held that all the witness evidence filed before it were incompetent and full of inconsistencies. It also agreed with the submissions of the respondents that the allegations of forgery raised in the petition were pre-election matter, which ought to have been raised 14 days after the documents were submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Kogi had, on Nov. 11, 2023, held its off-cycle election in which Ododo of the APC emerged winner beating his closest rival, Ajaka of the SDP with a wide margin. Ajaka, dissatisfied with the outcome of the election, had filed a petition before the tribunal, challenging Ododo’s victory. The case, which commenced in December 2023, came to its highest point on May 13 when SDP, Ajaka, APC, Ododo and INEC adopted their final written addresses, after which the tribunal reserved judgement in the petition. INEC, Ododo and his party, APC, had prayed the tribunal to dismiss Ajaka and SDP’s petition in its entirety for being incompetent and lacking in merit. The trio had, through their lawyers; Chief Kanu Agabi, SAN; Joseph Daudu, SAN and Emmanuel Ukala, SAN, respectively, had told the tribunal so while adopting their final written addresses and presenting their arguments against the petition. However, Ajaka’s lawyer, Pius Akubo, SAN, had urged the tribunal to discountenance the respondents’ submissions and uphold their petition.

        "content": "HONG KONG , May 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ — With generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) transforming the social interaction landscape in recent years, large language models (LLMs), which use deep-learning algorithms to train GenAI platforms to process language, have been put in the spotlight. A recent study by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) found that LLMs perform more like the human brain when being trained in more similar ways as humans process language, which has brought important insights to brain studies and the development of AI models. Current large language models (LLMs) mostly rely on a single type of pretraining – contextual word prediction. This simple learning strategy has achieved surprising success when combined with massive training data and model parameters, as shown by popular LLMs such as ChatGPT. Recent studies also suggest that word prediction in LLMs can serve as a plausible model for how humans process language. However, humans do not simply predict the next word but also integrate high-level information in natural language comprehension. A research team led by Prof. Li Ping , Dean of the Faculty of Humanities and Sin Wai Kin Foundation Professor in Humanities and Technology at PolyU , has investigated the next sentence prediction (NSP) task, which simulates one central process of discourse-level comprehension in the human brain to evaluate if a pair of sentences is coherent, into model pretraining and examined the correlation between the model’s data and brain activation. The study has been recently published in the academic journal Sciences Advances . The research team trained two models, one with NSP enhancement and the other without, both also learned word prediction. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected from people reading connected sentences or disconnected sentences. The research team examined how closely the patterns from each model matched up with the brain patterns from the fMRI brain data. It was clear that training with NSP provided benefits. The model with NSP matched human brain activity in multiple areas much better than the model trained only on word prediction. Its mechanism also nicely maps onto established neural models of human discourse comprehension. The results gave new insights into how our brains process full discourse such as conversations. For example, parts of the right side of the brain, not just the left, helped understand longer discourse. The model trained with NSP could also better predict how fast someone read – showing that simulating discourse comprehension through NSP helped AI understand humans better. Recent LLMs, including ChatGPT, have relied on vastly increasing the training data and model size to achieve better performance. Prof. Li Ping said, “There are limitations in just relying on such scaling. Advances should also be aimed at making the models more efficient, relying on less rather than more data. Our findings suggest that diverse learning tasks such as NSP can improve LLMs to be more human-like and potentially closer to human intelligence.” He added, “More importantly, the findings show how neurocognitive researchers can leverage LLMs to study higher-level language mechanisms of our brain. They also promote interaction and collaboration between researchers in the fields of AI and neurocognition, which will lead to future studies on AI-informed brain studies as well as brain-inspired AI.” Media Contact Ms Annie Wong Senior Manager, Public Affairs Tel: +852 3400 3853 Email: anniewy.wong@polyu.edu.hk SOURCE The Hong Kong Polytechnic University",

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel faced new condemnation on Monday for strikes that local health officials said killed at least 45 Palestinians, including displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its , with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel asserts that it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it Israel said it was looking into the civilian deaths, saying it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior Hamas militants. Sunday night’s attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “We pulled out people who were in an unbearable state,” said Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan. “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal.” The Gaza Health Ministry said around half of the dead were women, children and older adults. On Monday, barefoot children poked at the blackened debris as searches continued. France, a close European ally of Israel, said it was “outraged” by the violence. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had been housing more than a million people — about half of Gaza’s population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group on Sunday launched a barrage of rockets from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said that bombings like the one in Rafah will have long-standing repercussions for Israel. “Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,′′ he told SKY TG24. Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the strikes could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strikes. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry described the strike on Tel al-Sultan as a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable the punishment is usually light. Israel has adamantly denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory . ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "description": "Gallant and Gantz criticize the move, say they won't support the legislationThe post Cabinet rejects appeal against bill lowering Haredi draft exemption age appeared first on The Times of Israel.",
        "content": "The cabinet rejected an appeal Monday by MK Chili Tropper against advancing a bill that would lower the age of exemption from military service for yeshiva students — paving the way for the Knesset to revive the 2022 legislation. The bill “will be brought to a vote within 14 days” in the Knesset on whether it can be revived from the previous legislative session, the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement. Earlier this month, after failing to agree with his Haredi coalition partners on military service for their traditionally exempt community, Netanyahu announced that he would revive the bill, which would lower the age of exemption from mandatory service for Haredi yeshiva students from the current 26 to 21 while “very slowly” increasing the rate of ultra-Orthodox enlistment. The lower army exemption age would mean Haredi yeshiva students wishing not to serve could leave full-time study at a younger age and potentially join the workforce. The move by Netanyahu was criticized by both minister Benny Gantz, who had initially promoted the bill while serving as defense minister, and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who said that he would block any draft law “brought unilaterally by some of the coalition factions.” While promoting the bill two years ago, Gantz insisted that it needed to be accompanied by efforts to extend the national service requirement to both Haredi and Arab Israelis. After the cabinet on Monday rejected the appeal by Tropper, a member of his National Unity Party, Gantz said that “the meeting today was painful proof that politics come before Israel’s security for the government’s ministers.” “Instead of enlisting [Haredi men] to service, they’re trying to buy time, and instead of pitching in for the war effort, they’re uniting over coalition considerations,” he said. Gantz pledged that the bill would not pass in Knesset and would not be tolerated by the High Court of Justice and the Israeli public. Haredi women and male yeshiva students are generally exempt from military service due to controversial longstanding arrangements. In 2017, the High Court of Justice invalidated the legal exemption as discriminatory and ordered the government to pass a new conscription law. The government has since been unable to agree on legislation, repeatedly extending the non-conscription policy, while Haredi politicians have sought to pass legislation cementing the exemptions. Many Haredim believe that studying the Torah helps protect the Jewish people and even the country, and fear that serving time in the army would dilute adherence to their strict ways of life and lead impressionable members of the community astray. Among non-Haredi Jews, this is widely perceived as draft-dodging by a group that refuses to integrate into mainstream society.",

        "content": "By BL Mumbai Bureau Comments READ LATER Adani Energy Solutions plans to raise ₹12,500 crore through a qualified institutional placement of shares or eligible securities, the company said after a board meeting that was held to consider the proposal. The proposal to raise funds will be put up for the approval of shareholders at the annual general meeting to be held next month. Last year the company had taken approval to raise a similar amount but did not follow through with that plan. The funds will be used to finance its expansion plans. Earlier this month, it had acquired Essar Transco from Essar Power and Essar Transmission for ₹1,900 crore. With this acquisition, the company’s network increased to 21,182 circuit km and the plan is to take it to 25,000 ckm. In an earnings call earlier this month, the company’s management had said that over the next 12-15 months it was looking at a tender pipeline worth ₹1.1-lakh crore in transmission assets and its share would be around 20-25 per cent. It was especially targeting projects that were critical for renewable energy park in Khavda. In the current financial year, it is aiming for a capex of around ₹6,000 crore that includes ₹1,200-1,500 crore for the Mumbai distribution business and the remaining for the transmission business. It is also looking at spending on smart meter projects, which will be in addition to the above. Comments",

        "description": "Apple Watch Ultra 2 now costs $729 after a 10% discount.The device is at its lowest price since launch.Discount may encourage upgrades and new purchases.",
        "content": "‘s latest , the Ultra 2, has seen a notable price drop of 10% for Memorial Day, bringing its cost down to $729. This new offer makes the smartwatch available at its lowest price since launch. The discount may tempt many consumers to consider upgrading their current devices, especially those who have been on the fence about making the purchase due to price concerns. The Apple Watch Ultra 2, launched in September 2022, is an advanced smartwatch designed to offer robust health tracking and connectivity features. It includes an always-on Retina display, advanced workout metrics, sleep tracking, and ECG functionality. It was unveiled by Apple Inc. during an event at their Cupertino headquarters. The watch also features improved water resistance and a longer battery life, making it suitable for a variety of fitness and lifestyle needs. Given the historical context, the Apple Watch Ultra 2’s debut was met with enthusiasm due to its enhanced features over previous models. Initial reviews highlighted its superior performance, yet the price was a sticking point for some consumers. This Memorial Day discount could be a strategic move to boost sales among those who were previously hesitant to invest in the high-end device. Comparing to earlier price cuts, this 10% discount stands out as the most significant, potentially accelerating market adoption of the watch. Previous sales and promotional events for the Apple Watch series have generally seen moderate discounts, often accompanied by terms and conditions that made them less appealing. This direct and sizable price cut is in stark contrast, potentially indicating a new marketing approach from Apple. This tactic may be aimed at capturing a broader audience looking for premium at a more accessible price point. Analysts have noted that this reduction might also shed light on Apple’s strategy to clear inventory ahead of possible new releases. – The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is now available for $729 due to a Memorial Day discount. – This is the lowest price the smartwatch has ever been. – The discount could drive upgrades and new purchases among cost-sensitive consumers. Apple’s decision to lower the price of the Apple Watch Ultra 2 by 10% during Memorial Day is a significant move, making the high-end smartwatch more accessible. This discount may encourage existing Apple users and new customers to invest in the device, especially those who previously found the price prohibitive. Given the product’s extensive features and the historical context of Apple’s pricing strategy, this new price point could drive substantial market activity.",

        "description": "Israel faced new condemnation on Monday for strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah that local health officials said killed at least 45 Palestinians, including displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire.",
        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel faced new condemnation on Monday for strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah that local health officials said killed at least 45 Palestinians, including displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas, with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel asserts that it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world's top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt its offensive in Rafah. Israel said it was looking into the civilian deaths, saying it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior Hamas militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war's deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. ''We pulled out people who were in an unbearable state,\" said Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan. ''We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal.'' The Gaza Health Ministry said around half of the dead were women, children and older adults. On Monday, barefoot children poked at the blackened debris as searches continued. France, a close European ally of Israel, said it was ''outraged'' by the violence. ''These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,'' President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had been housing more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas' last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group on Sunday launched a barrage of rockets from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said that bombings like the one in Rafah will have long-standing repercussions for Israel. ''Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,′′ he told SKY TG24. Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the strikes could ''complicate'' talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas' demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strikes. Egypt's Foreign Ministry described the strike on Tel al-Sultan as a ''new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.'' Jordan's Foreign Ministry called it a ''war crime.'' The Israeli military's top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur ''in a war of such scope and intensity.'' Speaking to an Israeli lawyers' conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of ''violence, property crimes and looting'' were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable the punishment is usually light. Israel has adamantly denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza's 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "content": "Bette Nash, holder of the Guinness World Record for longest-serving flight attendant, has died at the age of 88, according to statements from American Airlines and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants. “We mourn the passing of Bette Nash, who spent nearly seven decades warmly caring for our customers in the air,” American Airlines said in a statement posted to X. “She started in 1957 and held the Guinness World Record for longest-serving flight attendant. Bette inspired generations of flight attendants. Fly high, Bette.” The Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), the union representing flight attendants in the United States, posted its own tribute to Nash on Facebook. “Bette’s remarkable career spanned over six decades, during which she touched countless lives with her warmth, dedication and unparalleled service,” said the post. “Her passion for flying and her commitment to her passengers were truly inspiring. Bette’s legacy will forever be remembered in the aviation community and by all who had the privilege of knowing her.” Nash started her lifelong career with the now-defunct Eastern Airlines in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 4, 1957. In 2016, CNN had an opportunity to fly with her on her daily route from Reagan Washington National to Boston Logan on American Airlines. Nash, who was 80 at the time, said the romance and glamor of flying initially attracted her to the job. “I wanted to be a flight attendant from the time I got on the first airplane – I was 16 years old, I was sitting with my mother on a green leather couch at Washington [Reagan National Airport], and this crew came up from TWA,” she recalled. “The pilot and the flight attendant walked across the hall and I thought ‘Oh my God,’ and I said that was for me.” Nash said she went on to get a college degree, but she never deviated from her dream. She applied for a job as a stewardess, as flight attendants were then known, shortly after graduating. “And the rest is history,” she told CNN with a big smile. According to ABC News , Nash never officially retired from her role with American Airlines and died on May 17 in hospice care. Nash was awarded the Guinness World Record for having the longest career as a flight attendant in early 2022. “Her career surpasses the last longest flight attendant with 63 years, 61 days as of Jan. 4, 2021,” said the Guinness announcement. Nash saw many changes in the world of aviation over those six-plus decades of flight, telling CNN planes were places of luxury when she started flying, a time when everyone wore their Sunday best and ate lobster on real china. “You worked harder physically in those days,” said Nash. “We served this big meal tray. And I was the only one on the plane, so I had to take care of everybody.” But the biggest changes she witnessed over the years related to technology. When Nash first began flying, all flight schedules were chalked up on a blackboard, and manuals and regulations came in book form. Eventually, those papers were replaced with tablets – which she says was a big adjustment. “Technology really made the difference of, ‘Am I going to stay or am I going to go?’” she said. “But even when I think I might retire or something, then I come to work and think, ‘Oh, I couldn’t do that.’ It’s stimulating coming out here. The airlines are evolving continuously, and you have to evolve with them.”",

        "content": "The Kogi State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja, on Monday, affirmed the election victory of Gov. Usman Ododo of All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Nov. 11, 2023 Kogi governorship poll. The three-member panel of justices, headed by Justice Ado Birnin-Kudu, held that the petition was bereft of substance and accordingly dismissed. The tribunal held that the petitioners; the social Democratic Party (SDap) and its candidate, Murtala Ajaka, failed to prove the allegations of over-voting and non-compliance with the Electoral Act, 2022 in the petition. The panel, in a unanimous, decision held that all the witness evidence filed before it were incompetent and full of inconsistencies. It also agreed with the submissions of the respondents that the allegations of forgery raised in the petition were pre-election matter, which ought to have been raised 14 days after the documents were submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Kogi had, on Nov. 11, 2023, held its off-cycle election in which Ododo of the APC emerged winner beating his closest rival, Ajaka of the SDP with a wide margin. Ajaka, dissatisfied with the outcome of the election, had filed a petition before the tribunal, challenging Ododo’s victory. The case, which commenced in December 2023, came to its highest point on May 13 when SDP, Ajaka, APC, Ododo and INEC adopted their final written addresses, after which the tribunal reserved judgement in the petition. It would be recalled that INEC, Ododo and his party, APC, had prayed the tribunal to dismiss Ajaka and SDP’s petition in its entirety for being incompetent and lacking in merit. The trio had, through their lawyers; Chief Kanu Agabi, SAN; Joseph Daudu, SAN and Emmanuel Ukala, SAN, respectively, had told the tribunal so while adopting their final written addresses and presenting their arguments against the petition. However, Ajaka’s lawyer, Pius Akubo, SAN, had urged the tribunal to discountenance the respondents’ submissions and uphold their petition. You must be logged in to post a comment.

        "description": "Now in its third year of the Russian invasion, Ukraine has been begging for more arms for its outgunned and outnumbered troops, especially in order to compensate for its lack of air defense equipment",
        "content": "As President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez of Spain inked a security agreement in Madrid on Monday, Spain promised to provide one billion euros in military assistance to Ukraine. At a joint press conference, Sanchez stated that the agreement “includes a commitment for one billion euros in military aid for 2024.” “It will allow Ukraine to boost its capabilities including its essential air defence systems to protect its civilians, cities and infrastructure which are still suffering indiscriminate attacks as seen this weekend in Kharkiv,” he said, referring to a Russian strike on the northeastern city that killed at least 16 people. Zelensky’s visit coincides with Russia’s largest territorial advance in eighteen months, a ground attack in the Kharkiv region that started on May 10 and is currently being fought by Ukraine. Now in its third year of the Russian invasion, Ukraine has been begging for more arms for its outgunned and outnumbered troops, especially in order to compensate for its lack of air defense equipment. Leopard tanks and modern Patriot missiles would be included in the agreement, the daily El Pais reported. Zelensky has already ratified bilateral security accords with a number of nations, such as the UK, Germany, and France. According to Sanchez, a variety of topics would be covered under the security agreement. “The agreement is based on a comprehensive overview of security and covers various areas such as military, humanitarian and financial support, as well as collaboration between Spanish and Ukrainian defence industries, as well as help with reconstruction and de-mining among other things,” he said. Madrid hasn’t given Kyiv much military support up until now. The Kiel Institute, which keeps track of the weaponry that have been promised and shipped to Ukraine since the Russian invasion, reports that Spain has only committed 330 million euros in military aid to date, making it a negligible European contribution. In contrast, the numbers indicate that London has contributed 9.22 billion euros, and Berlin, Paris, and Rome have contributed 18.61 billion, 5.65 billion, and 1.0 billion euros, respectively. Spain promised to transfer an quantity of Patriot air defense missile systems to Ukraine in April. Additionally, ten Leopard tanks were deployed.",

        "content": "THERE’S something about foamy, milky coffee and it’s almost knocked tea off the top spot as the national’s favourite drink. A survey by Open Reach found that 56 per cent of Brits opt to have a coffee when purchasing a hot drink on the go. Lattes are picked by 20 per cent as their favourite coffee shop hot drink - compare to 22 per cent picking a leafy brew. But bean counters amongst you might want to find which is best value after a recent survey found the cost of a medium latte rose up by 30 per cent between 2021 and 2024. So where can you get the perfect latte ? We put them to the test so you don’t have to. The Costa latte smells like the beans have been freshly roasted. But when drinking it, you have to deal with a ridiculous amount of foam before you get to the actual drink. While this tastes like super milky coffee, as it should, it leaves a chemical aftertaste behind. It’s not the worst I’ve tried, but it’s not the best either. In fact, it’s not really memorable at all. 3/5 Underneath the foam, this just looks like a terribly brewed cup of tea - not coffee-like at all. I can barely smell any coffee coming off it, just the smell of warmed milk. It doesn’t taste like coffee when you sip it, either. The beanie hit comes after you’ve finished a slurp, as an aftertaste. It’s ok, but if I’m paying this price, I want more coffee. I feel like I could drink this and have a nap, no problem. That’s not my idea of coffee. 2/5 You can smell the coffee before I’ve even taken the mug from the barista. It’s so strong I can feel the caffeine hit me just though inhaling it. Taking a sip, I’m hit in the face with pure coffee goodness. It’s then followed with smooth milk, which rounds off the taste. It’s a perfect meld of the two. My favourite by far. 5/5 I can smell the coffee through the lid as I pick this one up to drink. Within seconds of taking a sip, I can taste the coffee, which hits me like a bolt. It’s incredibly bitter and the milk does little to temper that. The strong bean taste lingers well after you’ve finished the cup. If you’re an espresso drinker who is thinking of branching out, this is the latte for you. 4/5 This barely smells of anything which makes me wonder how much coffee has actually made it into my cup. This is a little sickly at first before giving over to a coffee bean bonanza. The bitterness of the beans is softened by the large amount of milk. It’s a decent brew but I feel like they’ve added in sugar, which ruins it a bit. I’d buy it again over some of the others. 4/5 This doesn’t have a strong coffee smell to it when you take the lid off. Nor does it taste particularly strong. It's like drinking warm milk with a hint of bitterness rather than a sharp coffee twang. It’s the cheapest on the list, and it’s clear why. There’s no quality bean in this cup. 1/5",

        "content": "THERE’S something about foamy, milky coffee and it’s almost knocked tea off the top spot as the national’s favourite drink. A survey by Open Reach found that 56 per cent of Brits opt to have a coffee when purchasing a hot drink on the go. 7 Our Sun reporter tested all the frothy cups Credit: Olivia West Lattes are picked by 20 per cent as their favourite coffee shop hot drink - compare to 22 per cent picking a leafy brew. But bean counters amongst you might want to find which is best value after a recent survey found the cost of a medium latte rose up by 30 per cent between 2021 and 2024. So where can you get the perfect latte ? We put them to the test so you don’t have to. Costa, £3.90 7 Costa smelled freshly roasted Credit: Olivia West The Costa latte smells like the beans have been freshly roasted. But when drinking it, you have to deal with a ridiculous amount of foam before you get to the actual drink. While this tastes like super milky coffee, as it should, it leaves a chemical aftertaste behind. It’s not the worst I’ve tried, but it’s not the best either. In fact, it’s not really memorable at all. 3/5 Most read in Money TOO FAR Inside Celtic star Greg Taylor's cup final spat with Rangers hero Todd Cantwell EUR ON Gers handed Champions League qualifying boost as Hearts discover Europa League fate 'YIKES' Scotland Euros hero spotted at Old Firm Cup final with radical hair change GER ERROR The unnoticed series of errors in build-up to Idah's winner BEFORE Butland howler I’ve saved just under £2,000 by skipping coffees but it’s not what you think Starbucks, £4.10 7 The Starbucks latte was more foam than coffee Credit: Olivia West Underneath the foam, this just looks like a terribly brewed cup of tea - not coffee-like at all. I can barely smell any coffee coming off it, just the smell of warmed milk. It doesn’t taste like coffee when you sip it, either. The beanie hit comes after you’ve finished a slurp, as an aftertaste. It’s ok, but if I’m paying this price, I want more coffee. I feel like I could drink this and have a nap, no problem. That’s not my idea of coffee. 2/5 WINNER Pret, £3.80 7 The clear winner had a strong coffee aroma Credit: Olivia West You can smell the coffee before I’ve even taken the mug from the barista. It’s so strong I can feel the caffeine hit me just though inhaling it. Taking a sip, I’m hit in the face with pure coffee goodness. It’s then followed with smooth milk, which rounds off the taste. It’s a perfect meld of the two. My favourite by far. 5/5 Nero, £3.50 7 Nero hits you like a bolt Credit: Olivia West I can smell the coffee through the lid as I pick this one up to drink. Within seconds of taking a sip, I can taste the coffee, which hits me like a bolt. It’s incredibly bitter and the milk does little to temper that. The strong bean taste lingers well after you’ve finished the cup. If you’re an espresso drinker who is thinking of branching out, this is the latte for you. 4/5 Leon, £3.85 7 Leon was a little sickly Credit: Olivia West This barely smells of anything which makes me wonder how much coffee has actually made it into my cup. This is a little sickly at first before giving over to a coffee bean bonanza. The bitterness of the beans is softened by the large amount of milk. It’s a decent brew but I feel like they’ve added in sugar, which ruins it a bit. I’d buy it again over some of the others. 4/5 LOSER Greggs, £2.40 7 Greggs is the cheapest but far from best Credit: Olivia West This doesn’t have a strong coffee smell to it when you take the lid off. Nor does it taste particularly strong. It's like drinking warm milk with a hint of bitterness rather than a sharp coffee twang. It’s the cheapest on the list, and it’s clear why. There’s no quality bean in this cup.

        "description": "The PVV, VVD, NSC, and BBB coalition’s plan to put the cultural sector under",
        "content": "The PVV, VVD, NSC, and BBB coalition’s plan to put the of 21 percent instead of the low VAT rate of 9 percent, also includes sports events. The plan will result in much more expensive tickets and season tickets and make things like football matches much less accessible, the sector told . The cheapest season ticket at an Eredivisie club like Feyenoord for next season costs 385 euros. After the VAT hike, which will take effect in 2026, that same season ticket will cost around 430 euros. And that is without the annual price increase of around 5 percent that football clubs implement. The KNVB called the measure “a slap in the face” of the country’s largest popular sport. According to the Dutch football association, the right-wing coalition is passing its bills on to football supporters, players, and clubs. “This affects people with a small wallet, and they are more likely to drop out due to the higher costs, especially in times of rising costs,” a KNVB spokesperson told AD. “When it was decided 20 years ago that the tickets would be sold at the low VAT rate, agreements were made about the proceeds,” the KNVB spokesperson said. “Approximately 3.5 million euros are invested annually in youth football and the development of over 2,800 football clubs. The loss of this is disastrous for amateur football.” Matthijs Keuneng of Supporters Collective Netherlands wonders whether the new coalition considered the effects of the measure. “The great thing about football stadiums is that many people with different backgrounds now come together there, a reflection of all levels of society. The danger is that a popular sport like football will soon become something for the elite.” The coalition’s “main lines agreement” did not specifically mention sports in this measure. The sports world hopes that the parties just didn’t consider that the measure also impacts sporting events and will give them the same exception they did to cinemas and amusement parks. The fact that sports are included in the measure only became clear in parliament last week when D66 leader Rob Jetten complained that his FC Twente season ticket would become more expensive.",

        "content": "The Praktiseer community in Limpopo allegedly threatened to attack nursing staff at a local clinic after a patient recently passed away an hour after visiting the facility. As a result, the Limpopo Department of Health has called for calm in the area. According to the department, a female patient with a history of peptic ulcers and chronic hypertension arrived at the clinic on Sunday morning at around 7:30, complaining of a burning feeling in her stomach after eating spicy home-cooked meals. Blood pressure and other vitals normal “Upon arrival at the clinic, she was seen by the clinical nurse practitioner, who examined her and found that her blood pressure and other vitals were normal,” the department said. The department said the patient was reportedly given Lansoloc capsules (Used for the short-term relief of heartburn and increased acidity of the stomach) and Panado tablets for the burning sensation. She was requested to come for a follow-up consultation days later.

Threats to attack nursing staff “Consequently, the circumstances surrounding her passing have caused distress in the community, and allegations of threats to attack the nursing staff have also emerged. “Police have been called to keep an eye on the staff, as they live in constant fear. This may affect the quality of service at the clinic,” the department said. It added that it understands that such events can cause anxiety in the community. “It is for this reason that the MEC has ordered a team to investigate, which is comprised of the forensic pathologists who will conduct an autopsy. Currently, the cause of death is unknown, and only these investigations will shed a clear light,” the department said. It also called on the Praktiseer community members not to speculate on what could have caused this death and called for calm in the community. ‘Allow investigative processes to unfold’ “Allow all the investigative processes to unfold so that the real cause of death for the patient can be ascertained,” the department said.

        "content": "appears to be keeping his focus away from the ongoing saga with , a close family friend has revealed. , it seems father and son did not manage to bridge the gap. A spokesperson for Harry commented that King Charles was \"busy\" with a \"full programme\". \"The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon,\" they added. Yet, there's been some confusion about this account. Reports have emerged suggesting that although agreed to request to stay at a Royal residence, the Duke opted for a hotel stay instead. On the podcast 'The Royals with Roya and Kate', Sunday Times Royal Editor Roya Nikkhah shed light on the situation: \"All the narrative from the moment he [Harry] touched down and we got that statement from , his father is too busy, he completely understands. That set the mood music for the whole week that Harry had said Pa is too busy to see me.\", reports . \"I just thought something didn't feel quite right about this, so I dug away and dug away a bit deeper and found out that actually, Harry had asked if he could stay and Charles had said yes, come and stay son. \"You come and stay in a royal residence, you are near where I am so it's going to be much easier for me to see you given what's going on with my diary and your diary.\" \"And that turned everything on its head because the narrative from Harry that I wanted to see my father but he is too busy to see me, actually the reality was Charles said yes please do come and stay in a royal gaff and that would make it much easier for me to see each other.\" Kate Mansey, The Times assistant editor, commented: \"Someone at the palace told me that the King was bruised by that statement that Harry put out, which all plays into exactly why.\" A supposed close source to the disclosed to The Daily Beast: \"Relations are as bad as they have ever been. Nothing has been resolved. But Charles does not spend a great deal of time dwelling on the matter because he is so busy.\" When questioned about the recent speculation that William might be the barrier to and patching things up, the insider revealed: \"If William was prepared to reconcile with Harry it would certainly make things easier, but that's not the whole story. The king was particularly hurt by what Harry said about Camilla.\" In his explosive memoir 'Spare', Prince Harry labelled \"dangerous\" and claimed she had thrown him under the bus for her own \"personal PR altar\". He insinuated that she had intentionally leaked harmful stories about him to the media to improve her own image. Lady Lansdowne, 68, a close confidante and godmother to Camilla's daughter Laura Lopes, opened up about the Duchess's feelings towards the recent public remarks. Speaking to The Sunday Times, she revealed: \"Of course it bothers her, of course it hurts. But she doesn't let it get to her.\" She shared Camilla's stoic approach to controversy, saying: \"Her philosophy is always, 'Don't make a thing of it and it will settle down - least said, soonest mended.'\".",

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel faced new condemnation on Monday for strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah that local health officials said killed at least 45 Palestinians, including displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas , with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel asserts that it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt its offensive in Rafah.

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel faced new condemnation on Monday for strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah that local health officials said killed at least 45 Palestinians, including displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas , with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel asserts that it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt its offensive in Rafah. Israel said it was looking into the civilian deaths, saying it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior Hamas militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “We pulled out people who were in an unbearable state,\" said Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan. “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal.” The Gaza Health Ministry said around half of the dead were women, children and older adults. On Monday, barefoot children poked at the blackened debris as searches continued. France, a close European ally of Israel, said it was “outraged” by the violence. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had been housing more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group on Sunday launched a barrage of rockets from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said that bombings like the one in Rafah will have long-standing repercussions for Israel. “Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,′′ he told SKY TG24. Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the strikes could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strikes. Egypt's Foreign Ministry described the strike on Tel al-Sultan as a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable the punishment is usually light. Israel has adamantly denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "content": "Wingback Federico Dimarco has come in for criticism for his performance for Inter Milan against Hellas Verona. Today’s print edition of Turin-based newspaper Tuttosport, via FCInterNews , brand the 26-year-old as “too casual” on both sides of the ball in the 2-2 Serie A thriller. Dimarco started on the left flank for Inter in yesterday’s match at the Bentegodi. The Italian international has been decisive from that wingback role on numerous occasions for the Nerazzurri this season. But yesterday evening was not one of them. Dimarco was not really able to influence the attack much. The 26-year-old is often a player who drifts around finding pockets of space, wreaking havoc in the opposition defensive structure. But yesterday evening there was not much of that from Dimarco. Whether due to a lack of physical condition or the absence of his usual speed of thought, the left-wingback was largely anonymous when Inter had possession of the ball. Federico Dimarco Criticized For Performance On Both Sides Of The Ball For Inter Vs Verona There were no telling deliveries or attempts at goal from Dimarco. That is the principle value that the Italian brings to the Nerazzurri when he is at his best. And then, Tuttosport argues, Dimarco was also poor on the defensive side of things as well. Verona ratcheted up the tempo of the match both with their high pressing and with an extremely proactive approach in possession. And it was a pace that Dimarco never really came up to. The 26-year-old had the likes of Jackson Tchatchoua and Stefan Mitrovic to deal with on his flank. And Dimarco never really restricted either Gialloblu player’s influence. This allowed Verona’s attack a lot of space in which to interchange quickly and cause problems for Inter throughout the first half. In the view of Tuttosport, Dimarco was one of the Inter players who looked like they were perhaps ready for the season to be over.",

        "description": "“After eight years, 14 season, 19 players and over $1,000,000 awarded, Survivor is officially bringing the Sia Prize to a triumphant end,\" host Jeff Probst confirmed",
        "content": "It’s the end of an era — Sia is done giving cash prizes to her favorite Survivor contestants and winners. For the past 14 seasons, the singer has personally awarded a select few contestants an extra cash prize from her own personal funds. To date, Sia has given away more than $1 million. But after the conclusion of season 46 came and went earlier this week with seemingly no Sia prize handed out, Survivor host Jeff Probst confirmed that the singer has decided to stop awarding her own “Sia Prize.” “It’s the end of one of the most unique eras in the history of Survivor ,” Probst wrote in an Instagram post a couple of days ago. “After eight years, 14 season, 19 players and over $1,000,000 awarded, Survivor is officially bringing the Sia Prize to a triumphant end.” Sia started gifting contestants who didn’t win the show’s $1 million prize their own money after season 33, Survivor: Kaoh Rong , when she went on stage during the finale to award $50,000 to fan favorite Tai Trang. Traditionally, she has told each “Sia Award” recipient what she has found special about them. “I still vividly remember the day Sia stood up in the audience during the live finale of Survivor: Kaôh Rōng and made her way onstage,” Probst wrote. “She was so taken by Tai’s commitment to protecting a chicken that she awarded him $50,000 of her own money. Tai was shocked, the audience was shocked, I was shocked! What was happening? Sia was on stage in her wig handing out money to a Survivor player!?” “That was the beginning of what became affectionately known as ‘The Sia Prize,’” he continued. “And over the years Sia has brought so much joy to so many players and it was always straight from her heart. So it is with tremendous gratitude and admiration to Sia that we bring to a close one of the most unique relationships a TV show could ever have with a pop star of Sia’s global wattage.” “I’m really honored for Survivor to have this one of a kind association with Sia,” Probst concluded. “She’s in the Survivor Hall Of Fame of Superfans!” Earlier this year, Sia rewarded Season 45 cast members Carolyn Wiger (the season’s second runner-up) with $100,000, Carson Garrett (who placed just after Wiger) with $15,000, and Lauren Harpe (who followed Garrett) with $15,000. A video posted to PopCrave’s Twitter at the time showed Harpe’s reaction to Sia’s unexpected generosity. “I wanted to tell you that you’re awesome, and I really felt the struggle for you and your kids and stuff,” Sia said. “I wanted to give you not the biggest prize, but I wanted to give you 15 grand just to say, ‘I love you’ and, ‘Keep going.’” Trending The Boos Have It. Trump Ruled Ineligible for Libertarian Nomination Meet the Drummer Who Spent Decades With David Gilmour and David Crosby — And a Day With Bowie See Bradley Cooper Join Pearl Jam to Sing 'Maybe It's Time' at BottleRock Bruce Springsteen Postpones Four European Concerts Due to 'Vocal Issues' Sia has not yet commented on her decision to stop the “Sia Prize.” During an interview on Howard Stern earlier this year, Probst continued to praise the singer and her fandom of the show . “Her thought is this: I make a lot of money. I’ve been really lucky, and I want to share it with the people who entertain me and bring me joy. And one of those shows is Survivor .”",

Inside the top of the tower room reveals a home office and it is surely one that will make any colleague on a zoom call or google hangout instantly jealous, with panoramic views across the town and the water on two sides that might be a disadvantage, distracting you from hitting your work deadlines. The space is versatile though, it could be a reading nook or cute chill out zone to watch the sun set over the water accompanied by an evening drink. It's surely with great excitement that you push open the front door at the base of the tower and wander into the entrance hall? And the space rewards you fully with the grandest of welcomes starting with a mesmerising stained glass double doorway from the porch area into the home. Into the entrance hall and it is so spacious it can even happily host a cute seating area with a pretty fireplace, a home to a log burner flanked by a stunning stained glass window - how many Welsh homes can compete with such a unique place to watch the match? A truly breathtaking entrance hall that is bursting with impressive original features including marble pillars and detailing mosaic tiled floor, moulded cornice, stained glass panels in windows and doors and, or course, a sweeping staircase that every grand house demands and the one at Glynne Tower is a carved stunner. The garden room at the rear of the house gives the first glimpse of the incredible view over the garden and the water towards the English coast. Currently set up as a formal dining room its function is versatile and its use is all year, with a door to the delightful garden veranda for summer days and a log burner providing a cosy ambience when the winter appears. The kitchen diner is the next social space, easily welcoming a dining area so the cook can have company while they create a feast in the well-equipped kitchen that includes a Rangemaster range cooker with double gas oven, grill and a five zone electric hob, and extractor hood, integrated Miele dishwasher and integrated Liebherr fridge, freezer and washing machine. Tucked away at the front of the house there's a contemporary lounge dripping in floor-to-ceiling glass doors and accessed via a cute spiral staircase - it's a space that epitomises this memorable house - a surprise to discover and a truly delightful one, there's something to see and fall in love with around every corner. This hidden space is one of the many gems inside the house and is currently set up as a study and lounge, with a sizeable roof lantern ensuring the room enjoys cascading light from above as well as from the wall of glass. Taken from the estate agent video of the property this image shows the pretty and private, sun-drenched courtyard accessed from the ground floor lounge - it's a super special space for relaxing and entertaining with an intimate atmosphere as a direct contrast to the sweeping views from the rear of the house that stretch for miles to the horizon. The ground floor is home to two of the five bedrooms and this one in particular is a fabulous space to enjoy restful slumber - there's a whole wall of bespoke built-in storage to make sure everything has a home to keep this as a clutter free zone, plus mirror doors bounce light around the space as well as showing you how the outfit is looking before you step outside for the day. The ground floor bedroom has a sleek and contemporary ensuite within sleepy stumbling distance and this level can also boast a family bathroom boasting the same high level of facilities and décor. Up the incredible staircase to explore the next two storeys and there are some stunning spaces waiting to impress you with their sweeping views. There's a dining room directly off the landing that is a very relaxed space and versatile too - it could easily be home to a different function - and is well-placed as part of another social hub, partially open-plan to another lounge via a wide, open doorway. The first floor dining room flows into this very special space - a lounge with an incredible view accessed via a wall of bifold doors and a contemporary log burner that hangs from the ceiling and ensures this room is super cosy in the winter as you watch the wild Welsh weather rush across the expansive landscape outside. Step out onto the balcony with a morning coffee, to enjoy a lazy brunch, entertain guests or sip a night time drink with a view over the communal garden and Bristol Channel so mesmerising it's hard to stop staring. There are two more double bedrooms on the first floor, both with an ensuite, before the grand staircase transports you to the absolute gem that crowns this amazing property - the principal bedroom suite. The spectacular principal suite occupies the whole of the second floor. Imagine waking up to that view once the duo of electric black-out blinds have slowly revealed it. Making the windows into two sets of bifold doors with glass panels creating a Juliet balcony is a genius move, maximising the connection to the outside world and the view. The principal bedroom can boast a large bathroom as its ensuite with a double sink and more thoughtful design, creating a half wall between the bath and the toilet area is a simple idea but very effective, so a relaxing time in the bath is accompanied by a view of the rooftops of Penarth and not the room's other facilities.",

We seek to go after Hamas and limit civilian casualties... This is an unfolding story.\" The strike was aimed at two Hamas militants responsible for \"many attacks\" targeting Israelis in the occupied West Bank, he said. \"The were drenched in Israeli blood, these two individuals,\" Hyman said. \"According to initial reports, a fire broke out after the attack. These terrorists were hiding underground, and it would appear that there were civilian casualties.\" The military said that the strike, which came hours after a rocket attack from Rafah had targeted Tel Aviv, had killed Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, both senior officials for Hamas in the West Bank.",

        "description": "Introduced in January, the Audi Q8 e-tron edition Dakar is now rolling off the assembly line in Brussels, Belgium. The Q8 e-tron edition Dakar is the off-road-oriented first Audi EV available in showrooms.",
        "content": "Named after the world-famous desert rally, the is based on the Audi Q8 advanced 55 e-tron quattro. Audi will build only 99 examples of the off-road-focused Q8 e-tron. A frosted serial number on the D-pillar proudly communicates the model’s exclusivity to onlookers. Another exclusive exterior feature on the sides is puddle lamps, which project “edition Dakar” and remind the driver they’re entering a special Audi. The Audi Q8 e-tron edition Dakar is available in Magnetic Gray, Mythos Black metallic, and Siam Beige metallic paint options. Customers ordering it in the Mythos Black metallic colour can optionally specify it with a distinctive decal package inspired by the Audi RS Q e-tron, the German automaker’s Dakar Rally race car. The limited-edition model’s Bottom Line in the front carries the Mythos Black Metallic finish and its charging port doors on the sides feature “edition Dakar” branding. The key cover is also exclusive and features special branding. Audi has tweaked the regular Q8 e-tron’s air suspension for light off-roading on the Q8 edition Dakar. The latter has 31 mm higher ground clearance, which makes it more capable off the road. It stands tall at 206 mm in the base setting, but it keeps getting lower as the speed increases, by 15 mm at 85 kph, 17 mm at 100 kph, and 13 mm at 120 kph. Audi states 20o as the approach angle, 26o as the departure angle, and 19o as the ramp angle. As for wading depth, that measurement stands at 300 mm. Optional camera-based digital mirrors help reduce the vehicle’s width by 15 cm. Audi uses 18-inch wheels wrapped in General Grabber AT3 all-season tyres on the Q8 e-tron edition Dakar but ships it with a set of 20-inch wheels and summer tyres as well. The grippier all-terrain tyres give the EV an improved grip on irregular surfaces like gravel, snow, gravel, stony terrain, and mountain and forest paths. For regular road usage, customers can switch to the summer tyres. A roof rack with a load capacity of 40 kg is standard on the Q8 e-tron edition Dakar. Inside, the MMI operating system additionally shows the vehicle’s tilt angle in addition to other regular information. Exclusive display themes with specially created background images and coordinated ambient lighting further elevate the feeling of sitting in a go-anywhere rugged Audi. A two-zone automatic climate control system is standard, while a four-zone version is available as an option. Powering the Q8 e-tron edition Dakar are two motors, one at the front and one at the back, producing 300 kW or 408 PS (in boost mode) and 664 Nm of torque. A 0-100 kph sprint takes just 5.8 seconds (summer tyres)/5.9 seconds (all-terrain tyres), while the top speed is 200 kph. A 106 kWh lithium-ion battery pack, chargeable at up to 11 kW (AC)/170 kW (DC), gives the Q8 e-tron edition Dakar a WLTP range of up to 487 km. In Germany, Audi has priced the Q8 e-tron edition Dakar at €119,900.",

        "content": "Tom Holland's return to the West End stage in Romeo & Juliet has sparked mixed reviews following its opening night at the Duke of York’s Theatre last week. The Marvel star, described by one reviewer as 'uncharismatic,' stars opposite Francesca Amewudah-Rivers in an edgy, modern production directed by theatre visionary Jamie Lloyd. While some critics lauded the show as 'mesmerising,' others found it 'lifeless.' Despite the divided opinions, Francesca received unanimous praise for her portrayal of Juliet, being hailed as the play's 'saving grace.' Her performance stood out even as she faced a 'barrage of deplorable racial abuse' following her casting announcement in April. In a two-star review, the BBC's Hugh Montgomery described the production as \"a depressingly lifeless affair, which somehow manages to be both overstated and underpowered.\" According to one review, Holland's portrayal lacked depth, with his emotional range appearing limited and his character reduced to \"snarling disaffection\" towards the end. While Daily Mail's Patrick Marimon awarded the play a generous four stars, highlighting Holland's ability to captivate the audience with his \"dreamy gaze,\" other critics were less impressed. The Express' Neil Norman gave the production a scathing one-star review, labeling it \"absolute drivel\" and criticizing Holland's lack of charisma as Romeo. However, The Guardian's Arifa Akbar offered a more balanced perspective, praising the chemistry between Holland and Amewudah-Rivers while noting the deliberate restraint in Jamie Lloyd’s stylized production.",

        "content": "The San Diego Padres have hovered around .500 all season, but maybe their newest weapon can help them string together some wins. In Sunday's 5-2 victory over the visiting New York Yankees, flamethrowing right-hander Jeremiah Estrada jumped to prominence, striking out all five batters he faced and setting a Padres franchise record by fanning his past 10. The Padres, who had lost five straight home games, have the surging Miami Marlins coming to town for a three-game set that starts Monday. San Diego manager Mike Shildt professed to knowing Estrada's potential since the right-hander was claimed off waivers from the Chicago Cubs in the offseason. \"This guy's got an elite fastball, and now he's got secondary pitches in the zone. It's just a lethal combination,\" Shildt said after Sunday's game. Estrada routinely hit 97-98 mph and mixed in splitters and sliders. \"He demonstrated a lot of positive things throughout the offseason with us, including spring training, and the message just continued to (be) get better at some of these things, (that) ‘If you do that, you can be a force at the back end of games.'\" Estrada came on in relief of starter Joe Musgrove with one out in the sixth inning after the Yankees took a 1-0 lead. The 25-year-old struck out the red-hot Aaron Judge on three pitches and Alex Verdugo on four. After San Diego rallied for four runs in the bottom of the inning, Estrada took down Giancarlo Stanton, Anthony Rizzo and Gleyber Torres. Since being called up from Triple-A El Paso on April 26, Estrada is 2-0 with a 0.59 ERA and one save in 11 appearances. Right-hander Michael King (4-4, 4.28 ERA) gets the start for the Padres on Monday. In May, King is 2-1 with a 3.24 ERA. He is coming off a 7-3 win over the Cincinnati Reds on Wednesday. He went 6 2/3 innings, giving up three runs on four hits and two walks with six strikeouts. King has faced the Marlins once in his career. While with the Yankees, he pitched two innings as an opener and allowed two runs on four hits with three strikeouts in a 3-1 loss in Miami on Aug. 12. While the Marlins have won nine of their past 13 games, including four consecutive series, their starter on Monday has been struggling. Left-hander Trevor Rogers (1-6, 6.11) has been limited to no more than 3 2/3 innings in three of his past four starts, after going at least five innings in his first six. In his past four starts, he is 1-2 with a 10.05 ERA. He has allowed 17 runs (16 earned) on 26 hits with 11 walks, one hit batter and 14 strikeouts. Opponents hit .377 against him in that span. Rogers has made one start against the Padres in his career, tossing five shutout innings in a no-decision in May 2022. Miami took two out of three against the host Arizona Diamondbacks over the weekend, with Marlins pitchers holding the reigning National League champions to four runs in three games. Jake Burger went 6-for-12 in the series after entering the weekend hitting .164 in his first 31 games. He scored three runs and drove in three versus the Diamondbacks. Burger credited the coaching staff for helping him get on track. \"I think maybe (hitting coach John) Mabry and I got some stuff figured out in the cage. ... Just, like, calming everything down in the box,\" Burger told Bally Sports Florida. \"Skip (Schumaker, manager) and I had a really good conversation a couple days ago. He's like, ‘Hey, when you're out there, you have swagger when you're right. Nothing's speeding you up, you're not rushing to get in the box, you're kinda bobbing your head to the music, whatever it may be.' ... You know what? Let's just get back to having fun.\" --Field Level Media",

Till 2 pm, about 49.53 per cent polling was recorded against 4.63 lakh graduate voters. Polling began at 8 am and concluded at 4 pm. The counting will be held on June 5. Also Read Political parties gear up for Nalgonda-Khammam-Warangal MLC bypoll Voters queue up as Telangana Legislative Council by-election begins The by-election was necessitated following the resignation of sitting BRS MLC Palla Rajeshwar Reddy who won the Assembly polls from the Jangaon constituency in December last year. Minor incidents were reported at a few places during the polling. An independent candidate P Ashok Goud was attacked by Congress leaders at Narkatpally on Monday morning. Goud had objected to them allegedly distributing money to graduate voters at a function hall and also attempted to record it on his mobile phone. The Congress leaders are learnt to have beaten him and his followers apart from damaging his phone, apart from taking away another phone. Later, Goud and others staged a protest against the Congress leaders at Narkatpally police station. A total of 52 candidates are contesting, but the main competition is between the ruling Congress, the BRS and the BJP. The Congress party nominated Chinthapandu Naveen alias Teenmar Mallanna and BJP fielded G Premender Reddy, while A Rakesh Reddy is the BRS candidate. Polling was held at 605 polling stations under the Graduates constituency spread across 34 Assembly constituencies in 12 districts. Unlike general elections where the EVMs are used, the polling was conducted with ballot papers where the voters cast their preferential vote by marking against the candidates in the order of priority with a violet colour pen provided by the authorities. Later, they deposited their ballot papers in the ballot boxes. Voters who stood in the queues before 4 pm were allowed to cast their votes. The final voting percentage is likely to be announced on Tuesday.

Subsequently, I discuss the implications for monetary policy. Chart 1 shows the evolution of headline and core inflation since . me on the disinflation patterns since August (the month immediately prior to our last rate hike our September monetary policy meeting).

Headline inflation and core inflation (annual percentage changes) Sources: . Notes: HICP refers to headline inflation and HICPX to HICP excluding food and energy. The latest observation for April . Chart 2 shows the relative contributions of the major categories: energy; food; goods; and services. Services inflation now accounts for the vast bulk of the overall inflation rate. In turn, this reflects the non-uniform dynamics: while the other categories have seen major declines, with the April indicating energy inflation running -0.6 per cent, food inflation 2.8 per cent and goods inflation 0.9 per cent, services inflation was still elevated 3.7 per cent. HICP decomposition (annual percentage changes and percentage point contributions) Sources: and staff calculations. Notes: Goods refers to non-energy industrial goods. The latest observations for April . Chart 3 shows the evolution of the refined versions of the underlying inflation measures tracked by the , which adjust for the temporary impact of energy shocks and supply bottlenecks.

Notes: HICP refers to headline inflation, HICPX to HICP excluding food and energy, HICPXX to HICP excluding food, energy, travel-related items and clothing, and PCCI to the Persistent and Common Component of Inflation.

( ), “ ”, , No 2875, . The latest observations for April . While Chart 3 reports broad measures of underlying inflation, Chart 4 examines the domestic inflation rate, which is aggregated across sectors with import content. The on this measure is motivated by the higher sensitivity of domestic inflation to local pressures. Although domestic inflation remains quite elevated, the exclusion-type indicators (weighted median and trimmed measures) suggest that the breadth of the domestic inflation dynamic is narrowing. Domestic inflation (annual percentage changes) Sources: and staff calculations. Notes: Domestic inflation is an aggregate of HICP items with a relatively import intensity, as explained in Fröhling, A., O’Brien, D. and Schaefer, S. ( ), “ ”, , Issue 4, . The latest observations for April . In a similar vein, Chart 5 shows services inflation. In April, services inflation declined slightly to 3.7 per cent. The decline in services inflation since last summer largely been in non-labour-intensive services sectors, reflecting the indirect impact of lower energy prices, the easing of supply bottlenecks and the fading out of pandemic reopening effects in these sectors. As shown in Chart 5, there is a relatively tight medium-term relation between wage inflation and the inflation rate for labour-intensive services sectors (which make up a large of the domestic inflation component). Over time, deceleration in wage growth is necessary in order for services inflation to converge to a rate that is consistent with meeting the two per cent target for overall inflation. Services inflation developments (annual percentage changes) Sources: and calculations. : Latest observations for the fourth quarter of for compensation per employee and April for the rest. In relation to wage dynamics, Chart 6 shows the evolution of compensation per employee and compensation per hour until Q4 and negotiated wages until Q1 , while Chart 7 shows a set of wage trackers. The wage tracker – an important tool used to assess wage developments across the area – is signalling that overall wage pressures have moderated since . Furthermore, the Indeed wage tracker – which reflects the wages offered in job postings and thereby should be a leading indicator for overall wage dynamics – materially decelerated in recent months. the same time, wage growth is expected to remain elevated in , and to show a bumpy profile. These developments reflect the staggered nature of the wage adjustment process as workers continue to recoup real wage losses from past price shocks, as as the important role of one-off payments in this process. Such one-off payments also behind the increase in area negotiated wage growth in the first quarter. Similarly, one-off payments likely played a significant role in the increase in the growth rate of the “wages and salaries” component in the experimental release for Eurostat’s labour (LCI) for Q1 , which jumped to 5.0 per cent from 3.2 per cent in Q4 . The impact of higher wages on price pressures depends on the rate of labour productivity growth. In , labour productivity fell, such that unit labour costs grew more quickly than wages. Preliminary for the first quarter of suggest that aggregate labour productivity was constant; given the strongly pro-cyclical behaviour of labour productivity, the March staff projections foresee labour productivity growing 0.1 per cent in , 1.2 per cent in and 1.2 per cent in due to the output recovery outpacing employment growth. Under this baseline, unit labour costs will grow more slowly than nominal wages. In addition to a slower rate of growth of labour costs, deceleration in domestic inflation also requires compression in profits. The annual growth in unit profits peaked 9.4 per cent in the last quarter of and stood 2.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of . The March projections exercise foresees unit profit growth turning negative in , implying that profits will buffer the relatively strong labour growth. Unit profit growth is then expected to recover somewhat from , helped by a robust economic recovery and strengthening productivity growth.

As shown in Charts 8 and 9, feedback from firms participating in the Corporate Telephone Survey (CTS) and the Survey on the access to of enterprises (SAFE) points to lower wage growth this year.

The latest observations for March . Finally, Chart 10 shows some forecasts of near-term inflation dynamics for the rest of . Due to the swings in energy prices during , there will be oscillations in base effects in the monthly inflation readings during , while the staggered reversal of various temporary fiscal supports will also have uneven effects on price levels. Both headline inflation and core inflation expected to fluctuate around current levels for the rest of the year. -term forecasts for HICP (left panel) and HICPX (right panel) (annual percentage changes) Sources: , March staff macroeconomic projections for the area, Consensus Economics, Bloomberg and calculations.

Even if inflation does not smoothly decline during the rest of , further disinflation can be expected in the course of . This next phase of disinflation should be underpinned by the lowering of labour pressures, ongoing compression of unit profits, the dissipation of the adverse effects of past energy shocks, supply bottlenecks and the pandemic reopening, and the further unfolding of the disinflationary impact of the restrictive monetary policy stance. This disinflationary dynamic is consistent with both inflation stabilising our target later in and a substantial economic recovery. The latter will be supported by rising real incomes, improvements in the terms of trade and the prospect of disinflation unlocking future interest rate reductions and boosting domestic consumption and investment, while the normalisation of foreign demand will facilitate growth in exports. The sustainable attainment of the medium-term inflation target would be difficult in the absence of sufficient growth to foster the demand conditions that would be aligned with an overall inflation rate of two per cent. Finally, it is essential to track the evolution of inflation risk, in addition to indicators of the expected inflation path. The lowering of perceived inflation risk since last summer is plausibly connected to the faster-than-expected decline in inflation (even if this somewhat reversed in the initial months of ): the September staff projections pencilled in inflation 3.2 per cent, while the March projections revised inflation down to 2.3 per cent. Since last summer, a range of measures show that near-term inflation expectations have also come down and that the risk of inflation staying above target in the term diminished: the right tail in the distribution of -term inflation expectations in the Survey of Professional Forecasters markedly diminished compared to the peak inflation phase in late ; the inflation risk premium embedded in five-year-on-five-year inflation swaps declined by about 40 basis points since last summer; the option-implied probability of above 2.5 per cent inflation in the five-year-on-five-year interval dropped, while the option-implied probability of below 1.5 per cent inflation picked up; to the Consumer Expectations Survey, households have recognised the improvement in inflation outcomes and marked down their near-term inflation expectations; according to the results from the SAFE, firms have lowered their near-term inflation expectations, while the proportion of firms fearing high inflation in the medium term decreased. The role of monetary policy in the disinflation process been to ensure that the large inflation shocks did not translate into an increase in the medium-term inflation trend through medium-term inflation expectations shifting above our two per cent target. This required a substantial adjustment in monetary policy for two reasons: first, in the normalisation phase, to avoid that excessively- nominal interest rates would pro-cyclically add to the initial inflation shock; and, second, in the restrictiveness phase, to make sure that demand conditions dampened, so as to ensure that the multi-round adjustment process for prices and wages is consistent with a timely return of inflation to the two per cent target. Put differently, the aim of a restrictive monetary policy stance is to limit the persistence of backward-looking inflation dynamics and steer forward-looking inflation dynamics towards the medium-term anchor. While backward-looking inflation dynamics continue to play out (especially in relation to domestic/services inflation), these should continue to ease over the next year due to several factors: (a) with significant progress in and in reversing the real wage that was generated by the - inflation surge, wage growth should be lower in than in ; (b) with inflation lower than inflation, there will be less catch-up pressure from post-shock inflation on prices and wages in ; (c) the upward impact from the reversal of fiscal measures and energy base effects will be less relevant in than in ; and (d) the lagged impact of monetary policy tightening will still be contributing significantly to disinflation dynamics during . With forward-looking inflation expectations anchored, the dissipation of the backward-looking component will underpin the convergence in inflation towards the target. our June meeting, if our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further increase our confidence that inflation is converging to our target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction. Among other considerations, the subsequent pace of rate cuts will be slower if there upward surprises to underlying inflation (especially in relation to the underlying dynamics of domestic inflation and services inflation) and the level of demand (in view of the implications of demand conditions for the medium-term inflation outlook) and will be faster if there downward surprises to underlying inflation and the level of demand. The future rate path will also depend on the evolving strength of monetary transmission. First, given the lags in transmission, the tightening effects from our past interest rate hikes still unfolding. While the impact of the tightening cycle on economic activity might have reached its maximum level the turn of this year, model-based analysis suggests that the bulk of the impact on inflation is comparatively backloaded, with substantial pass-through still expected to transpire in the period ahead. Second, with expected inflation various horizons now lower than the date of our last rate hike, a given nominal interest rate now maps into a higher real interest rate. It is straightforward that the calibration of the appropriate degree of restrictiveness should adjust for the impact of lower expected inflation. Third, the overall restrictiveness of aggregate financial conditions also depends on the evolution of term premia and risk premia. Among other factors, these will be influenced by developments in global financial markets. The future rate path will also be guided by our management of the two-sided risks in proceeding through the next phase. In one direction, easing the stance too quickly would not be consistent with inflation sustainably returning to target if inflation turns out to be more persistent than anticipated. In the other direction, keeping rates overly restrictive for too could push inflation below target over the medium term. This would require corrective action through a subsequent acceleration in rate cuts that could even require having to descend to below-neutral levels to fix any persistent drift towards a below-target inflation trend. In deciding on the appropriate policy rate path, we will continue to follow a -dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, and we not -committing to a particular rate path. This approach served us in the tightening cycle and many of the same considerations will apply during the unwinding phase. In relation to staff projections of various indicators, I rely on the March exercise. The projections from the June exercise will be published after our 6 June monetary policy meeting.

        "description": "The former Chief Justice of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir speaks about the recent unrest in the region, and more.",
        "content": "The life story of Justice (retd) Syed Manzoor Hussain Gillani, who was born and brought up in Karnah, in the border region of Jammu and Kashmir, reads like a perfect Bollywood masala film. His parents travelled to PoK in 1947, leaving him, then 2 years old, in the care of his grandparents. His parents could not return because war had broken out by then and stayed back in Muzaffarabad. He attended the Government Degree College in Baramulla and then went to Aligarh Muslim University to pursue a degree in law. When he visited his parents for the first time in the late 1970s, they convinced him to stay back in Muzaffarabad. The author of five books, he has held positions such as Advocate General, Vice Chancellor of a university, and Chief Justice. A leading legal luminary in the region, he spoke to from Muzaffarabad about the recent unrest in PoK. Excerpts from the interview: Why did the crisis escalate in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir? The crisis escalated because the government ignored demands for equal treatment in subsidies, especially in flour prices, which also apply to Gilgit-Baltistan. These tensions surfaced publicly when the Rawalakot-based Awami Action Committee of Poonch raised these concerns on May 8, 2023. The introduction of new taxes on electricity bills in August 2023, which were labelled as “protected” and “unprotected” taxes, further aggravated the situation. This led to widespread protests initiated by students of Muzaffarabad University and supported by local traders. These demonstrations also brought to light issues relating to the Neelum-Jhelum hydropower project. In response, the government arrested numerous people in September last year. Tensions came to a head when a Deputy Commissioner in Dodyal was attacked on May 9 after he tried to disperse a crowd, and protesters marched towards Muzaffarabad the next day. Apart from these economic problems, what were the other factors that led to the unrest, and was anything done about it? Basically, there is a structural problem in the relationship between Pakistan-administered Kashmir [PAK] and the Pakistani government. Only when they are streamlined under a constitutional mechanism will the problems be solved. In my opinion, whatever the Pakistani government does here in practice should be governed by specific constitutional provisions so that there is some accountability to the Parliament and the Supreme Court of Pakistan. There is no doubt that it is being administered by Pakistan in a similar manner as the provinces of Pakistan, but there must be a regulatory mechanism under the Constitution of Pakistan. Your side of Kashmir has not been as politically active as the Indian side of Kashmir. Why? Lack of bold leadership like that of Sardar Ibrahim Khan, Sardar Qyoom Khan, and K.H. Khursheed is the main reason. There is no voice at the national level. The governments in Muzaffarabad bow to pressure from the Pakistani bureaucracy. Secondly, one-third of the 45 Assembly segments are reserved for non-resident nationals, commonly referred to as refugees from the Indian part of Kashmir. They do not live in Kashmir [Pakistan-administered Kashmir] and have no stake, but they influence the results and have a say in the formation of the government. They are dependent on the bureaucracy for various reasons such as issuance of residency certificates. Since you have seen both parts of Kashmir, how do you compare them in terms of political power, distribution of resources, and so on? The Indian part of Kashmir is governed by the Indian Constitution and is represented in Parliament and often in the Union government, and there is oversight by the Supreme Court of India. Apart from that, there has also been vocal leadership. If we minus what happened to Jammu and Kashmir on the Indian side after August 2019 and some other things, we realise that the institutions on that side are comparatively strong. What is the political structure of PoK? The region has a parliamentary form of government consisting of a Legislative Assembly, which is responsible for local affairs, headed by the Prime Minister and has a President as the symbolic head of state. And then there is another structure, the AJK [Azad Jammu and Kashmir] Council, which is headed by the Prime Minister of Pakistan. The catch is that all executive matters are the responsibility of the AJK Council, which is not an elected body and represents the Pakistani government. Whatever policy matters and decisions the Pakistani government takes for the other provinces applies to AJK as well. Unlike the Indian part, we have no representation in the Pakistani parliament. Almost all national political parties operating in Pakistan have their branches in AJK, and the party that forms the government in Islamabad usually governs in Muzaffarabad as well. After the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, is there a fear that this territory will be annexed to Pakistan? Apart from the constitutional arrangement, AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan are integrated with Pakistan in every respect. Apart from the scanty voices in favour of an independent Kashmir, people do not feel alienated from the rest of Pakistan. There is only formal constitutional assimilation left, which has been publicly expressed after the abrogation of Article 370. Of late, many Indian leaders have been vowing to reclaim PoK, and it is even being suggested that the people there could start a movement and join the Indian Union. What is the legal and factual situation? In my view, all agreements between the princely states and the British government lapsed on August 15, 1947. Therefore, the State of Jammu and Kashmir became technically free from August 1947. Parts of the State were liberated by the people from the forces of the local Dogra ruler, and they proclaimed their government on October 24, 1947. When Maharaja Hari Singh acceded to India, he was left with the part that had remained under him, not the part that had been liberated from him. The AJK government later entered into an agreement in which it ceded its sovereignty to Pakistan (Karachi Agreement of April 1948). That is the legal and factual position, which has remained hidden from the Indian public. COMMents",

        "content": "A transport driver faces numerous charges after an off-duty police officer and a cattle truck operator were forced to take evasive measures in order to avoid a head-on collision on Highway 17 near Bruce Mines. A news release issued by East Algoma OPP states that on the evening of April 29, a westbound tractor trailer crossed the centre line into the eastbound lane, forcing both the cattle truck and the off-duty office onto the shoulder of the highway. The driver of the tractor trailer was identified from dashcam footage obtained from the cattle truck. The accused was arrested and charged on May 25. #EastAlgomaOPP have arrested and charged a CMV driver with numerous HTA and CC offences after a near head-on collision on Hwy 17 near Thessalon. Luckily nobody was injured and dashcam video was captured. #DriveSafe , stay awake, #DriveSober and no #DistractedDriving . ^py pic.twitter.com/HPGkfprTcJ Full text of the OPP news release follows: A cattle tractor trailer driver and an off-duty OPP officer avoid head on collision with an oncoming tractor trailer on Highway 17 west of the Town of Bruce Mines. On April 29, 2024 [at approximately] 5:30 p.m., an off-duty East Algoma Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) officer was operating their personal vehicle and travelling to work for a night shift in the Town of Thessalon. The off-duty officer was behind an eastbound fully loaded tractor trailer transporting cattle. An oncoming white tractor trailer with white boxed trailer was travelling westbound on Highway 17 and crossed the centre line and entered the eastbound lane. The cattle truck driver manoeuvred to the shoulder and was able to evade the eastbound tractor trailer. The driver was successful in maintaining control as the cattle load had shifted. Once the cattle truck swerved to the shoulder, the off-duty officer then observed the westbound white tractor trailer approaching towards their vehicle. With debris skidding across the roadway, the off-duty officer was able to manoeuvre onto the shoulder, narrowly avoiding rolling into the south ditch. The white westbound tractor trailer returned to the westbound lane and continued westbound on Highway 17. The East Algoma Detachment of the OPP continued their investigation and attained dashcam footage from the trucking company who was transporting the cattle. With the assistance from Caledon OPP Detachment on May 25, 2024, shortly after 1 p.m., OPP arrested the driver of the westbound tractor trailer in the Town of Caledon. As a result, Jagvinder Singh Dhindsa, 32 years of age from Brampton, was charged with: • Dangerous operation • Careless driving • Speeding • Unsafe move-lane or shoulder • Fail to share half roadway - meeting vehicle • Fail to take 10 hours off in a day (two counts) • Enter inaccurate information in record (two counts) • Fail to accurately complete daily inspection report • Drive after 14 hours on duty in a day • Fail to maintain daily log • Enter inaccurate information in record The accused is scheduled to appear before the Ontario Court of Justice in Elliot Lake on July 11, 2024.",

        "content": "Shareholders of FBN Holdings Plc will receive a total dividend of N14.35 billion for the financial year ended December 2023, representing a total dividend of 40 kobo per share declared by the group. This was contained in the company’s corporate action announcement to the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) and obtained by the Nairametrics. The company also recently released its 2023 full year results after a prolonged period of delay due to regulatory approvals. Related Stories Nigerian Stocks: List of Dividends announced in 2024 MRS Oil proposes final dividend of N2.36 for FY 2023 The Board of Directors of the holding company recommended a dividend of 40 kobo per ordinary share of 50 kobo each, amounting to N14.358 billion. This company also paid its shareholders 40 kobo dividend in 2022 suggesting there was no growth this year. FBNH closed the week at a share price of N20 which suggest the current dividend of 40kobo per share delivers a dividend yield of just 2%. Other members of the FUGAZ stocks also declared much higher dividends with UBA, GTCO, Access Corporation and Zenith Bank declaring N2.8/share, N3.2/share, N2.1/share and N4/share respectively. The surprisingly low demand may have also contributed to the falling share price of the stock which dropped 11% last week. The group reported a profit after tax of N310.4 billion, a significant increase from the N136.3 billion reported for the same period in 2022. This marks the highest profit ever declared by the financial services giant in its more than 130-year history. Net Interest Income rose to N548.9 billion, marking a 51% increase from N363.2 billion in the previous year. The Impairment Charge surged by 231%, reaching N227.4 billion compared to N68.6 billion in 2022. Fees and Commissions increased by 64% to N193.1 billion, up from N117.6 billion. The group’s Operating Profit grew by 127%, reaching N358 billion from N157.7 billion. Earnings Per Share more than doubled, increasing by 129% to N8.59 from N3.75. The company also released its 2024 first quarter results showing a pre-tax profit of N238.5 billion representing a 310% increase year on year. What you should know: The bank reported the dividend will be paid to shareholders who appear on its register as of August 13 2024 whilst the actual dividend will be paid a few days later on August 23rd 2024. The company did not declare any bonus shares. FBNH closed trading on Friday, May 24, 2024 at N20.45 per share on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NGX), recording a 9.3% drop from its previous closing price of 22.55 NGN. The financial institution began the year with a share price of N23.55 but has since lost 13.2% off the price valuation.",

According to Resecurity’s cyber threat intelligence team’s research, shared exclusively with Hackread.com ahead of its publication, this year’s Hajj season is marred with an extensive range of frauds and scams. The pilgrimage involves a multitude of logistical steps, from booking travel and accommodation to managing finances and staying connected with loved ones, for which pilgrims typically rely heavily on mobile apps and websites. This reliance can expose them to frauds like fake travel agencies, online registration scams, sub-standard travel arrangements, and unlicensed travel companies created by organized crime groups, etc. The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) reports cases where individuals paid for sub-standard or non-existent travel arrangements, resulting in financial losses for victims. These scams often involve fake websites or invitations, duping people into providing personal information and money. Scammers also use social media platforms to promote fake Hajj packages and entice people with attractive offers, ultimately leaving individuals without a tour and no way to recover their money. According to Rsecurity’s blog post , researchers found that a fraudulent website Registergovcom was part of a larger identity theft campaign, which involved several fake websites disguised as free Hajj applications, tricking victims into sharing sensitive data. The information is used by threat actors for identity theft, fraud, and other cybercrime. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Moreover, Saudi Arabia’s official digital platform, Nusuk, launched to facilitate secure planning, booking, registration, and payment for Hajj and Umrah, is also exploited by cybercriminals. One of the phishing campaigns involving a fake site nusuksacom was found redirecting users to a payment interception form, stealing sensitive information. In addition, scammers are using generative AI and Troll Factories to spread deceptive content on social media and defraud individuals. Resecurity has blocked over 630 accounts suspected of distributing fraudulent content targeting individuals preparing for Hajj season. The team also successfully blocked a resource collecting payment data. Researchers call for stronger collaboration between platforms, law enforcement, and the private sector as Hajj approaches. Consumers are advised to be vigilant against online scams involving money exchange services, which can result in significant financial losses. To avoid falling victim to these scams, do your research on reputable services, verify their credentials, and exercise caution online.

        "content": "Minnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards remains confident in his team despite staring at a 3-0 hole against the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals. \"Time to make history, fellas,\" Edwards told his teammates in the locker room after Sunday's 116-107 defeat, per The Athletic's Sam Amick . \"I still don't feel like they can beat us, bro. We haven't all been clicking at one time. One game. One game.\" He added that \"we're here now, fellas\" and pressed his teammates by asking, \"What are we gonna do?\" No NBA team has ever advanced after losing the first three games of a best-of-seven playoff series. Only four, most recently the Boston Celtics last year, have even pushed the series to a winner-take-all Game 7. The Western Conference Finals have been close. The first two games were decided by four combined points, so Game 3 looks like a blowout by comparison. This was also a contest in which the Timberwolves led with five minutes left. Edwards' comments are why youth can sometimes be an advantage in the postseason. When you've made the playoffs in three of your first four seasons and individually risen to the occasion in each year, reeling off four straight wins may not sound that intimidating. But the history speaks for itself. If overturning a 3-0 deficit were that easy, then somebody would've done it by now. For Minnesota, it doesn't help the team's best players aren't delivering like they need to. Edwards had 40 points on 11-of-33 shooting in the first two games. Karl-Anthony Towns is averaging 15.0 points and shooting 27.8 percent from the floor in the series. Rudy Gobert had just nine points and six rebounds in Game 3. In the case of Towns, he's reinforcing the general perception some have that he can't step up on the biggest stage. KAT called himself the greatest shooting big man of all time and then walked into dirk's house and couldn't throw a marble into the grand canyon You wouldn't be surprised if the Wolves took Game 4 and maybe even pushed this series to six games given how small the margins have been. But there probably aren't many who share Edwards' level of belief.",

        "content": "Alazar Kebede When the term “Atlantic civilization” was coined in the 18th century, the underlying idea was meant to combine the values of the French and the American Revolutions. They were seen as the two indispensable pillars of a single, yet divided approach to social modernization. The values of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as well as those of liberty, equality and fraternity may sound hollow today, yet they have not lost any of their resounding power when looking at their impact. The Atlantic civilization remains based on the primacy of individual dignity, property and rule of law, a strict separation between state and society the freedom of religion as well as the freedom to travel. People’s ability to engage in self-criticism remains the essential quality of the Atlantic civilization. While hoping for the universalization of people’s understanding of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness remains an inherent driving force of human culture, it is important to re-evaluate the world as it stands. It is imperative for the future of the Atlantic civilization to realize the root causes of the conflicts which have taken us like a hurricane. The time has come to count the dead due to a series of acts of political violence committed over the past decade. We must take account of undeclared wars such as in the Ukraine, gruesome and barbarous acts of terrorism as in Iraq and Syria, incapable states which cannot really “fail” because they never worked in the first place such as Somalia, as well as states which can no longer prevent the outbreak of mass epidemics with global consequences such as Liberia or Guinea. The West may be keen to promote the rule of law and democratic participation, but people are confronted with upheavals in their borderlands that follow a different, if not altogether confrontational logic. Russia is projecting its imperial glory, if only out of weakness. The Arab and Muslim world is undergoing a transformation with cultural, political and economic tensions of the highest order. While often clad in religious language, these tensions reflect age-old geopolitical controversies and rifts. While Westerners are ambivalent about the use of military power, knowing too well its limits and the curse of Pandora’s Box that comes with the use of military power, they can no longer escape a global tide that changes their way of thinking. Aren’t they very scared of “foreign” fighters returning from Iraq or Syria, whether with a U.S. or EU passport? And what is their answer to self-declared “Sharia police” gangs patrolling the streets of London or Bonn, trying to prevent Muslim youth to enter “sinful” places such as discotheques and casinos? The Atlantic civilization is united these days, or so it seems. In reality, Western nations are divided in their perception of, and proximity to, current hotspots. Whether they are engaged in sanctions against Russia or in organizing a military coalition against the barbaric terror of the self-declared “Islamic State caliphate,” the truth of the matter is this: Nobody has a good answer, and no strategy seems to work the way we thought these things happen. What’s happening in Russia is about re-establishing spheres of influence, territorial and ethnic. The shift from Arab spring to a Caliphate winter represents almost the opposite: the individualized, decentralized and excessively violent, cruel and unpredictable use of force. According to political analysts, understood properly, Eurasian imperialism and Arab radicalism are two sides of the same coin. They both reek of obvious helplessness and long-term self-defeat. They represent deep inferiority complexes to which the West has not developed any serious response beyond the usual policies of carrots and sticks. The Atlantic civilization has to learn that political ideologies and violent conflicts which are no longer relevant in the West have found willing repetition outside their sphere. The Arab world may well have entered its genuine Thirty-Year War, while nobody knows how long Russian imperialism may last. But as Russia’s and the Arab world’s inner tribulations have begun to penetrate the cohesion and stability of the West, they pose a threat to the Atlantic civilization that goes beyond the reaction of concerned neighbors. That is why, according to political analysts, it is time to reinforce the foundation of this unique experiment in the history of man’s search for freedom without coercion. The Atlantic civilization needs to redefine its foundation: the search for truth cannot justify the destruction of freedom, one’s own and that of others; the rule of law and democratic participation include the protection of minorities; the outbreak of violence is the end of politics and not its continuation. In the end, this is what liberal democracy is all about. It is against this backdrop that the success or failure of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) takes on a new dimension. These negotiations are about far more than a trans-Atlantic trade and investment partnership. Political analysts noted that it is an investment into a common future of liberal democracy and it is about a partnership that cannot be traded on the altar of petty populism and myopic trends on either side of the Atlantic Ocean.",

        "description": "Memorial Day is one of just six occurrences when the flag is flown differently than normal.",
        "content": "(NEXSTAR) — Memorial Day has a relatively simple purpose: honor those who have died in American wars. What isn’t as simple is how the American flag should be flown to mark the holiday. Three years after the Civil War ended, Decoration Day was established. It was intended as a time for the nation to decorate the graves of the war dead with flowers, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs . It was later set for May 30 to correspond with flowers being in bloom. Years later, the holiday would be renamed Memorial Day. According to the VA , while about 25 places have been named in connection with the origin of Memorial Day, the official birthplace was declared Waterloo, New York, by Congress and President Lyndon Johnson in 1966. A ceremony was held there on May 5 of that year, honoring local veterans who had fought in the Civil War. Businesses closed and flags were flown at half-staff. Up until the end of World War I, the day continued to honor those who had fought in the Civil War. In 1971, Memorial Day was declared a national holiday by Congress, placing the day on the last Monday in May to honor those who have died in all American wars. For many, part of honoring those individuals entails flying the flag proudly in their front yards. However, according to the United States Code , Old Glory is flown a little differently on Memorial Day. The code — which officially addresses dozens of subjects — says the American flag should fly at half-staff from sunrise until noon on Memorial Day. Then, it should be “raised briskly” to the top of the staff until sunset, according to the VA . This is one of only six occurrences in which the flag flies at half-staff. The others are the recently-observed Peace Officers Memorial Day on May 15, as well as Korean War Veterans Armistice Day on July 27, Patriot Day on September 11, Pearl Harbor Day on December 7, and any day when the president issues an order lowering the flag as a mark of respect for the death of a principal figure or others, the American Flagpole & Flag Co. explains. Whether the flag is flying at half-staff or full-staff, it should only be displayed from sunrise to sunset on buildings and on stationary flagstaffs in the open. When raised, it should always be done briskly; when lowered, it should be done so ceremoniously. If illuminated at night, the flag can remain up at all times. American flags on walls should be hung so the union, or stars, are in the top left corner. The same should be said for those hanging in windows — but the union should be in the upper left corner for those viewing it from the outside. In only one situation can a flag or pennant be displayed above the U.S. flag: During church services conducted at sea by naval chaplains for personnel of the Navy, the church pennant may appear above the American flag.",

        "content": "Warren believes Joshua should be made to wait so Usyk and Fury can fight for all the belts again (Image: Seconds Out/YouTube) Frank Warren, the promoter of Tyson Fury, has stated that Fury deserves another shot at the undisputed heavyweight title in his rematch with Oleksandr Usyk. This will be a setback for Anthony Joshua and Daniel Dubois, who were eyeing the IBF belt. Usyk is anticipated to lose his IBF title before the rematch later this year, but Warren asserts that the title cannot be stripped from him until his suspension is over. Following his tough win over Fury in Saudi Arabia, Usyk has been prohibited from fighting until June 2 - Fury was also suspended, but his ban was lifted on May 25. Usyk has already asked for an exception to retain his IBF title, and Fury's promoter believes it's only fair that they fight for all four belts again, despite Joshua and Fury's stablemate, Dubois, wanting their chance at the title.

There were rumours that the IBF title could be up for grabs this weekend for Dubois and Hrgovic, but Warren thinks it should only be the interim title at stake. Warren revealed to Seconds Out: \"He has been suspended, Oleksandr, because of how tough the fight was. I think it's 45 or 40 days by the commission so he cannot be stripped at this stage of the same because he's not in a position to defend his title so we will see what happens. That fight we just spoke about Dubois vs Hrgovic is a fantastic fight and in the worst-case scenario it'll be an interim title fight. If it goes ahead as an interim title fight, I have no problem with that,\" reports the Mirror . \"A lot of people will be p***ed off at me saying this, especially Hrgovic's camp and maybe with Daniel who I'm involved with but I feel like it should be for the interim because I think the rematch should be for the four belts.\" Anthony Joshua was hoping to fight for the IBF belt at some point this year (Image: Richard Pelham/Getty Images) The future of Usyk's belt remains uncertain, with a request already submitted to the IBF. But with Warren insisting that the rematch against Fury should be for the undisputed crown again, Joshua and Dubois could be forced to wait until after the rematch for this chance. The promoter also praised Joshua, who is currently on a three-fight winning streak, suggesting his next bout should be against Dubois, provided the Brit prevails over Hrgovic. \"That's what everybody wants to see, that's what I'd love to see, AJ is coming off a really good line of form at the moment, he's looked very good in his last two fights and him and Ben Davison is obviously a partnership that's really working well,\" he added.

        "content": "RED Lobster will close 17 restaurants in Florida alone as financial troubles persist. The seafood chain filed for bankruptcy in Florida on May 26 and will face closures in an additional 27 states. On May 26, Red Lobster filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the Sunshine State , per USA Today . The filing reveals how the chain restaurant has struggled in many ways, such as its 30% decrease in guests since 2019. In a 124-page document, CEO Jonathan Tibus shared why Red Lobster filed for bankruptcy and why he supported the decision. \"Recently, the debtors have faced a number of financial and operational challenges, including a difficult macroeconomic environment, a bloated and underperforming restaurant footprint, failed or ill-advised strategic initiatives, and increased competition within the restaurant industry,\" said Tibus. As of May 22, Red Lobster's website listed 99 locations closed across 28 states. Some of the locations are auctioning off their kitchen equipment via an online restaurant liquidator. The liquidator, TAGeX Brands, announced last week it was hosting auctions for supplies from 48 Red Lobster locations that have closed. Each winner would receive the \"entire contents of the Red Lobster location they bid on,\" according to the liquidator's website. The following Red Lobster locations are currently listed as temporarily closed on the restaurant's website. Alabama: Arizona: California: Colorado: Florida: Georgia: Idaho: Illinois: Indiana: Iowa: Kansas: Louisiana: Maryland: Michigan: Mississippi: Missouri: New Jersey: New York: North Carolina: North Dakota: Oklahoma: Pennsylvania: South Carolina: Tennessee: Texas: Virginia: Washington: Wisconsin: In related news, Cracker Barrel plans a $700 million transformation as the CEO claims the chain is \"just not as relevant as we once were.\" Plus, Applebee's fans \"Thought it was a hoax\" after a location \"randomly\" closed down leaving even workers stunned.

        "content": "The National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI) has made its first investment in Powerstove, a Nigerian company pioneering cookstove production and carbon credit projects, aimed at combating global warming and promoting sustainability among Nigerian companies focused on decarbonisation. Segun Ayeoyenikan, Director of Information at NASENI, said in a statement on Thursday that, as part of the investment, NASENI will provide Powerstove with growth capital and technical assistance, enabling the company to ramp up production from 100,000 units to over 1 million units per year. “This scaling is expected to have a substantial impact on Nigeria’s carbon footprint and contribute to the country’s transition to a more sustainable energy landscape.” Khalil Halilu, the Executive Vice Chairman, NASENI, said this substantial increase in production capacity will not only meet the growing demand for clean and efficient cookstoves but also significantly contribute to reducing carbon emissions in Nigeria. “With this investment, NASENI is not only supporting an impact-driven enterprise but also positioning itself to benefit from carbon credit revenue, thereby reinforcing its commitment to sustainable development,” Halilu said. “This investment underscores the strong commitment of NASENI’s leadership to address climate change proactively and to build a resilient and sustainable ecosystem of innovative Nigerian companies with the potential to drive decarbonisation efforts.”",

        "description": "After reaching their mid-30s, female fertility demonstrates a notable decline as age progresses, eventually resulting in age-related infertility.",
        "content": "Women who have not yet gotten married – very often religiously observant ones – or found a partner or girls who had cancer and had to undergo chemotherapy that can kill off their eggs – have high hopes of eventually getting pregnant. However, a meta-analysis of the efficiency of egg freezing has found that it decreases significantly if the eggs are frozen at a more advanced age. According to the new study led by physicians at the unit at Jerusalem’s Shaare Zedek Medical Center (SZMC), one of two women who froze eggs at an age younger than 35 gave birth using them; and one of three women who froze eggs at the age of nine to 36 years gave succeeded in having a baby. However, only about one if five women who froze eggs at the age of 40 and over gave birth with their help. As SZMC is a medical center run according to Jewish law, it is natural that observant Jewish women turn to its IVF unit to get their ova frozen and to use them to try to get pregnant. The clear and recommended conclusion of their research that encompasses all the information available in the world today is that it’s better to perform egg freezing before the age of 35. Often, women without a partner who feel the “clock is ticking” have their eggs frozen (at their own expense) in their late 30s. The study, published in the prestigious journa under the title “Planned oocyte cryopreservation: a systematic review and meta-regression analysis” was led by Dr. Avi Tsafrir and Dr. Ayala Hirsch from SZMC’s IVF unit together with Dr. Bruria Hirsch-Raccah from the School of Pharmacy of the Hadassah Medical Organization. In the study, the researchers gathered all the studies in the world that reported on women who froze eggs for the purpose of fertility preservation and later used them. The researchers found 10 studies that together included 8,750 women who froze eggs for the purpose of preserving fertility. Of these, about 1,500 (only 11% of all those who froze) returned to treatment with the aim of conceiving with the help of these eggs. The authors learned that the average age at which women freeze eggs was 38. In developed nations, women are increasingly delaying pregnancy. After reaching their mid-30s, female fertility demonstrates a notable decline as age progresses, eventually resulting in age-related infertility. Due to their large size, high water content, and unique intracellular structure, oocytes are particularly sensitive to cooling and prone to cryoinjuries The first successful birth from a frozen oocyte was reported in 1986, using the slow freezing technique. However, despite this early breakthrough, the widespread adoption of oocyte cryopreservation was hindered by poor survival rates of frozen eggs. A significant advancement came with the introduction of vitrification, which involves a solidification process in which the oocytes are treated with cryoprotective substances and submerged in liquid nitrogen at a temperature of -196°C. The steps are the same as in an IVF cycle: stimulation of the ovary with hormones followed by aspiration of the oocytes. This method was proven to be safe in terms of birth outcomes, and, in comparison with slow freezing, vitrification was significantly superior to slow freezing for oocyte survival. Fertility treatments available today do not address the decline in egg quality with age. makes it possible to preserve the normal capacity of the eggs at a young age, for use later. “In light of this, it appears that the chance of giving birth is strongly related to the age at which the freezing was performed and not related to the age at which the women returned to try to conceive with their help,” they wrote. Tsafrir wrote that since relatively few women out of the many who froze eggs actually returned to use them, the information regarding the effectiveness of the process is limited. Today, many women froze eggs for personal reasons. “Therefore, the collection of data for the first time from all over the world gives us well-founded conclusions and indications for important recommendations regarding the recommended age for egg retrieval.” Prof. Ido Ben Ami who heads SZMC’s concluded that “in recent years, we have seen an increase in the number of women who request egg freezing for personal reasons in all sectors, and we definitely see greater success rates in women who froze at a relatively early age.

        "content": "SHE’S the most-watched movie star you may never have heard of - but that won’t be for long. Brit actress Ella Purnell is about to go stratospheric as her Amazon Prime show Fallout became the most watched programme on any streaming service last month, with more than 7million views. Ella, 27 , plays naive vault-dweller Lucy in the post-apocalyptic show, venturing out into the wasteland to find her kidnapped father. Fallout went straight to number one on its release and is sure to catapult the stunning actress to super-stardom. Ella has already started to amass the trappings of an A-list life with 1.2million Instagram followers, a rocker boyfriend and an LA pad. Not that this is her first big role. She may have flown under the celeb radar until now but she already has plenty of impressive parts under her belt, with her talent spotted early by the likes of Tim Burton and Angelina Jolie . Born and raised in London, with her mum, step-dad and three brothers, while her dad and step-mum lived down the road, she landed a place at Sylvia Young’s theatre school at the age of nine and also starred as a child model. She won her first big role aged 11, beating hundreds of other kids to a part in the West End production of Oliver! The show gave her the acting bug and she quickly became the first-choice child star for directors looking for a girl to play younger versions of some of Hollywood’s biggest stars. In Disney’s Maleficent she played a young Angelina Jolie. In Never Let Me Go she played the child version of Kiera Knightley, and in The Legend of Tarzan she was the younger Margot Robbie . In an interview Ella said she once worried that playing the younger version of lead actors might hamper her career, but she figured: “If someone asks me to be the young Margot Robbie I am not gonna say no!” And she was right - she got to work with and learn from some of the biggest and best female stars in the world. “It really helped, watching how disciplined they were and how they were devoted and committed to their craft,\" she said to Crash. \"I actually just like to get to know them and see them as real-life human beings. Working with smart, driven women was a huge inspiration at a young age.\" But despite this early brush with fame, Ella still saw acting as a hobby until aged 18 she landed the role of Emma in legendary director Tim Burton’s 2016 \"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.” After that major success her career suddenly slowed down and she started to question her acting ambitions. \"I thought, 'I'm 21, I haven't had a job in a while, I really don't know if this is a job I want to continue doing,\" she confessed to the Belfast Telegraph. She didn't want to take on roles like \"the girlfriend of the main, male character; a female that needs saving; or the goal, something that is wanted. Just there to be a sex object, portrayed as weak, pretty, nice.\" Ella even considered pausing her career and heading to uni until she landed her first “grown-up” role as Tess in Sweetbitter, which saw her make the move across the pond to live and work in New York. As a huge fan of tattoos she was thrilled when she was told her character was going to get a tattoo on the top of her back. So she actually got the tattoo in real life - and converted her mum to body art too. She said: “She’d been against me getting tattoos for all 21 years of my life. But suddenly she’s like ‘I’m going to get one too’. \"And now I can’t stop her. She has so many, she won’t stop. It is like she’s addicted to the ink.\" Ella then switched to live in LA and landed the role of Jackie In Yellowjackets, the slow-burning hit which went viral telling the story of a girls’ football team who face a fight for survival after their plane crashes in the Rocky Mountains. Brand and culture expert Nick Ede says: Ella is one of those stars who have slowly crept up on audiences and we know we recognise, but we cant figure our where from. That's all about to change as she has wowed audiences in the hit Amazon Prime show Fallout and in the dark thriller Yellowjackets. She is fast becoming the UK's Sydney Sweeney and her trajectory to superstardom is happening in 2024. With her stunning looks, brilliant acting ability and a knack of holding down any accent she puts her voice to, she's one to watch. She has proved that she can do costume drama as well as kick ass fight scenes, which makes her a casting dream. She's also not afraid to talk about her ups and downs with mental health battels that makes her all the more relatable. With Hollywood falling for her, it wont be long before big brands come calling and she is cast in major advertising campaigns for fashion and beauty brands. With her near-million social media following, she's going to fast become the toast of the town and I am here for it! I see Ella leading the new Hollywood Brit pack alongside Leo Woodall, Amy Jackson, Kit Connor, Ncuti Gatwa, Andrew Scott and Ambika Mod. The show’s success took everyone by surprise - not least Ella. “We had no idea people were going to respond this way,” she told The Face. “When you’re making it, you’re only really living 50 per cent of the show. But when you add the music and the adult counterparts’ storylines, it works brilliantly. Still, it really was a surprise to all of us. None of us saw this coming!” As a result of the success of Yellowjackets and now Fallout, Ella’s gained an army of fans and social media followers who are lapping up her new glam red carpet shots as well as weekends spent at Coachella with her friends. And the constant on her Instagram is her boyfriend of three years - musician Max Bennett Kelly. When asked by a fan on Insta who her celebrity crush is, Ella didn’t hesitate to name her Max as the only one for her. The couple live together in LA with their dog, and regularly gush about each other online. The pair released a short film they made together last year, called Junk Male, about which Max posted: “I can’t believe it’s actually happening. kinda feels surreal to spend almost a year on something and then boom it’s just out. \"Couldn’t have done it without Ella, she really brought this film to life. so professional so bold ugh i’m so proud. seriously such an amazing director and i’m very happy we got to do this together :),” While Ella describes Max as “her rock” and made a heartfelt Instagram tribute to him in 2022 when her car got stolen with all her belongings in when she was moving house. She wrote: “How overwhelming his love is. It’s emotional being loved like this—being in the light of someone so kind and generous and gentle. Max, I adore you. You are so wonderful, so vibrant, so funny, so talented, so smart. I love the way your brain works. I love the way you interact with the world. The way you treat people. The way you dance. I love everything about you. It’s a joy to know you, let alone do life with you. \"I am so lucky, it’s insane. Thank you for being you, for holding it down and making me laugh and knowing what I need before I even know I need anything. Thank you for slowing me down and reminding me to breathe. Thank you for supporting all of my crazy ideas and big dreams. You bring out the best in me, and then some.” So it looks like hard luck to Ella’s growing army of male fans - she appears to be most definitely taken.",

        "description": "Memorial Day is one of just six occurrences when the flag is flown differently than normal.",
        "content": "(NEXSTAR) — Memorial Day has a relatively simple purpose: honor those who have died in American wars. What isn’t as simple is how the American flag should be flown to mark the holiday. Three years after the Civil War ended, Decoration Day was established. It was intended as a time for the nation to decorate the graves of the war dead with flowers, according to the . It was later set for May 30 to correspond with flowers being in bloom. Years later, the holiday would be renamed Memorial Day. According to the , while about 25 places have been named in connection with the origin of Memorial Day, the official birthplace was declared Waterloo, New York, by Congress and President Lyndon Johnson in 1966. A ceremony was held there on May 5 of that year, honoring local veterans who had fought in the Civil War. Businesses closed and flags were flown at half-staff. Up until the end of World War I, the day continued to honor those who had fought in the Civil War. In 1971, Memorial Day was declared a national holiday by Congress, placing the day on the last Monday in May to honor those who have died in all American wars. For many, part of honoring those individuals entails flying the flag proudly in their front yards. However, according to the , Old Glory is flown a little differently on Memorial Day. The code — which officially addresses dozens of subjects — says the American flag should fly at half-staff from sunrise until noon on Memorial Day. Then, it should be “raised briskly” to the top of the staff until sunset, according to the . This is one of only six occurrences in which the flag flies at half-staff. The others are the recently-observed Peace Officers Memorial Day on May 15, as well as Korean War Veterans Armistice Day on July 27, Patriot Day on September 11, Pearl Harbor Day on December 7, and any day when the president issues an order lowering the flag as a mark of respect for the death of a principal figure or others, the explains. Whether the flag is flying at half-staff or full-staff, it should from sunrise to sunset on buildings and on stationary flagstaffs in the open. When raised, it should always be done briskly; when lowered, it should be done so ceremoniously. If illuminated at night, the flag can remain up at all times. American flags on walls should be hung so the union, or stars, are in the top left corner. The same should be said for those hanging in windows — but the union should be in the upper left corner for those viewing it from the outside. In only one situation can a flag or pennant be displayed above the U.S. flag: During church services conducted at sea by naval chaplains for personnel of the Navy, the church pennant may appear above the American flag.",

Managing the delicate balance between addressing immediate humanitarian needs and making long-term investments in human capital for sustainable development in Somalia is particularly complex due to its unique circumstances. Introduction: Somalia operates under a federal system with two layers of government, adding an additional layer of complexity to decision-making and resource allocation. Additionally, the country is still recovering from a brutal civil war and is in an active, guns-blazing war with Al Shabaab, a potent terrorist organization, further complicating efforts to prioritize development initiatives. Furthermore, Somalia currently lacks an agreed-upon constitution, leading to ongoing disputes over elections and power-sharing arrangements. The prevalence of corruption allegations only exacerbates the situation, hindering the effective distribution of resources and stalling progress towards sustainable development goals. In light of the above, Somalia continues to grapple with poverty and climate change-induced natural disasters, leading to pressing humanitarian needs in the country. At the same time, investing in human capital, such as education, healthcare, and skills development, is crucial for long-term sustainable development. Navigating these multifaceted challenges requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account the intricate political landscape, security concerns, and governance issues in Somalia, while also ensuring that humanitarian needs are met and investments in human capital are made for long-term sustainability and development. This article, inspired by a set of questions I was asked during the third panel of the Biannual Human Capital Development Forum held in Mogadishu by the Office of the Prime Minister on May 20th 2024, seeks to briefly examine strategies for reconciling short-term relief efforts with long-term capacity-building initiatives to foster resilience and sustainable development in Somalia. To be blunt, the ten-minute timeframe provided by the panel moderator was insufficient for me, therefore I decided to respond in this illustrative essay. Short-term Humanitarian Needs and Long-term Investments in Human Capital: Short-term humanitarian needs in Somalia often encompass the critical provision of immediate food aid, crucial healthcare services, necessary shelter, and vital protection for vulnerable populations impacted by crises or emergencies. These interventions are crucial for preserving lives and tackling pressing challenges. Yet, to ensure enduring development results, it is crucial to supplement short-term relief initiatives with sustained investments in human capital. This may involve initiatives in education, healthcare advancements, and opportunities for sustainable livelihoods, thus paving the way for long-term resilience and progress in the country. Strategies for Balancing Short-term Needs and Long-term Investments: 1. Integrated Approach: In considering the impact of neglecting human capital development, it becomes evident that the reliance on humanitarian interventions may intensify. The absence of investment in human potential can result in a greater need for immediate assistance during crises. After all, it is the skilled workforce within a society who play a pivotal role in determining the success or failure of various endeavors. Cognizant of this fact, an integrated approach that merges short-term humanitarian aid with long-term development strategies is indispensable. This approach ensures a seamless continuum of care and support for both individuals and communities, addressing immediate needs while laying down the foundation for sustainable growth and resilience. Through the integration of immediate relief initiatives with sustained investments in human potential, Somali communities can enable their members to effectively address challenges and lessen their reliance on ongoing humanitarian assistance. 2. Targeted Interventions: Considering the exacerbating impact of climate change-induced crises on security, population displacement, and community degradation, it is paramount to prioritize interventions that holistically address the multifaceted challenges faced by communities. In the face of such complexities, it is essential to concurrently tackle immediate needs, including emergency healthcare and nutrition programs, while simultaneously focusing on sustainable, long-term development measures. This dual approach ensures that communities receive vital support during crises, while also equipping individuals with the knowledge and skills through education and training programs to build resilience and foster self-reliance for a brighter future. Through a combination of quick relief efforts and purposeful investments in human resources, communities can effectively confront the challenges brought about by climate change-induced crises and strive towards sustainable development and security for all. 3. Community Engagement: Engaging local communities in decision-making processes, project planning, and execution is essential to ensure the sustainability and impact of interventions. Through the inclusion of community members in these critical areas, projects can be tailored to address the specific needs and priorities of the local population, increasing their relevance and efficacy. This participatory approach also fosters a sense of ownership and accountability among community members, leading to greater buy-in and long-term success of the interventions. 4. Disaster Risk Reduction: To address the challenges posed by the climate crisis on small-scale farmers, townspeople, and entrepreneurs in Somalia, implementing disaster risk reduction strategies is crucial. These measures, such as early warning systems and community preparedness initiatives, can build resilience and mitigate the impact of future shocks on human capital development. Despite financial constraints, investing in disaster risk reduction is a proven cost-effective approach to safeguard livelihoods, protect communities, and promote sustainable development. Prioritizing these strategies can strengthen the Governments' ability assist the governed to cope with climate-related disasters, reduce vulnerability, and create a more secure environment for its them, ultimately enhancing long-term progress and prosperity. Achieving Sustainable Development through Balanced Investments: Strategically balancing short-term humanitarian needs with long-term investments in human capital is crucial for the Somalia Governments to pave the way for sustainable development outcomes nationwide. Strengthening the education system - curriculum and overall education reform - expanding healthcare access, promoting the necessary vocational training, and creating economic and employment opportunities are fundamental pillars for cultivating a resilient and empowered population. Collaborative efforts, innovative approaches, and a commitment to investing in human capital as a driver of progress are essential for achieving sustainable development goals in Somalia. Conclusion: Tackling the immediate humanitarian needs while investing in crucial areas like education, healthcare, and economic opportunities can put a positive trajectory in Somalia's overall development agenda. This will specifically lay a strong foundation for human capital development, leading to sustained progress and growth in the country. Granted, balancing short-term humanitarian needs with long-term investments in human capital is a complex, but it is an equally vital endeavor for Somalia's sustainable development journey. In addition to that leveraging a combination of immediate relief efforts and enduring investments in human capital development a foundation for resilient communities, educated workforce, and sustainable economic growth can be simultaneously realized. Through realistic and practical strategic planning, commensurate resource allocation, and effective community participation, Somalia can navigate the dual challenges of addressing the pressing humanitarian needs while laying the groundwork for a prosperous and sustainable future.
