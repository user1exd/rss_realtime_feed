        "content": "By: PTI Geneva May 28, 2024 00:30 IST Follow Us Facebook Twitter whatsapp World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday referred to the Global Traditional Medicine Centre set up in India and the first global summit on traditional medicine hosted by the country as he underlined that the year 2023 was a productive one in the UN health agency's work supporting access to medicines and other health products. \"We also established the Global Traditional Medicine Centre in India, and hosted the first global summit on traditional medicine,\" Ghebreyesus said in his remarks as he presented his report to the 77th World Health Assembly in Geneva. In March 2022, the Government of India and the UN health agency had signed an agreement to establish the WHO Global Centre for Traditional Medicine. This global knowledge centre for traditional medicine, supported by an investment of USD 250 million from India, aims to harness the potential of traditional medicine from across the world through modern science and technology to improve the health of people and the planet, the UN health agency had said in a press release at the time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said the agreement between the Ministry of Ayush and WHO to establish the Global Centre for Traditional Medicine (GCTM) - world's first - at Jamnagar, Gujarat, is a commendable initiative. He laid the foundation stone of WHO-GCTM in Jamnagar in April 2022. Speaking on the occasion, Modi had said that the WHO-GCTM is recognition of India's contribution and potential in this field. \"India's traditional medicine system is not limited only to treatment. It is a holistic science of life. India takes this partnership as a huge responsibility for serving the entire humanity.” WHO had convened the Traditional Medicine Global Summit in August last year in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. The summit was co-hosted by India, which held the G20 presidency in 2023. It was held alongside the G20 Health Ministerial meeting. The summit explored the role of traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine in addressing pressing health challenges and driving progress in global health and sustainable development. Ghebreyesus had arrived in Gujarat to attend the global summit on traditional medicine and was accorded a warm welcome. Praising India for its \"rich history\" of traditional medicine like Ayurveda and yoga, Ghebreyesus had stressed the need to integrate this ancient medicinal knowledge into the national health system of countries. \"India has a rich history of traditional medicine through Ayurveda, including yoga, which has been shown to be effective in alleviating pain. The Gujarat Declaration, the main outcome of this summit, will focus on integration of traditional medicines in national health systems, and help unlock the power of traditional medicine through science,\" the WHO chief had said. In his address to the World Health Assembly Monday, Ghebreyesus said 2023 was a year of many challenges, but also of many achievements. He said the year 2023 was a productive one in WHO's work supporting access to medicines and other health products. \"We prequalified 120 medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and other products last year for HIV, malaria, multidrug-resistant TB, Ebola, polio and Covid-19, as well as the first long-acting insulin analogues,” he said. He noted that one of the biggest disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic was to routine immunization programmes in many countries, resulting in backsliding coverage and outbreaks of measles, diphtheria, polio, yellow fever and more. \"In April last year, we launched 'The Big Catch Up' with UNICEF and Gavi, to support countries to shut down outbreaks and restore immunization programmes at least to pre-pandemic levels,” he said. In May last year, the WHO chief had declared an end to both Covid-19 and mpox as global health emergencies. “We continue to call on all countries to maintain and reinforce the capacities for surveillance, detection and response that they built during the pandemic. These investments must not go to waste.” © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd First uploaded on: 28-05-2024 at 00:30 IST Here’s Your Exclusive Pass To Premium Stories CLAIM NOW Deepak Tijori on not asking Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan for help Entertainment May 16, 2024 08:01 IST Deepak Tijori, a veteran actor and filmmaker, spoke about his 30-year journey in the industry and the challenges faced by independent producers.

        "content": "After suffering his earliest-ever defeat at the French Open, a tournament he has won a record 14 times, Rafael Nadal said it is unlikely for him to play at Wimbledon next month, even as he eyes a chance to turn out at the Olympics, taking place at his beloved Roland Garros later this year, one last time. “I can’t confirm anything, but I don’t think it’s smart (to play Wimbledon) after everything my body has been through,” he was quoted as saying by AFP at his post-match press conference. “It will be difficult playing on grass, considering that right after Wimbledon are the Olympic Games.” Nadal, hoping to be competitive in his first round against an in-form opponent, showed invariable signs of rustiness after playing only 15 matches since the start of 2023. He bowed out 3-6, 6-7(5), 3-6 to in-form fourth seed Alexander Zverev. The Spaniard was competitive, especially in the second set which he served for before slumping in the tie-breaker, but Zverev’s shotmaking, fitness and power proved too much to handle. Advertisement READ | French Open: Clay god Rafael Nadal’s exit starts end of unprecedented Roland Garros stronghold Nadal said his body had been through the wringer in recent times. “My body has been a jungle for two years. It has been a big fight, waking up as if a snake or a tiger had bitten me. I need to prepare myself and clear my ideas about a calendar. My main goal is to prepare for the Olympics and to prepare well to be healthy here,” he said, per tennismajors.com, at the press conference. The soon-to-be-38-year-old said he takes positives from Monday’s loss to the German. “My feeling is that I wasn’t that far. I was at a good level (in the match),” Nadal added. “If it was the last time I played here, I would be at peace with myself. I tried to do everything I could to play here. At least I did. Even if I lost, that’s part of the business... I don’t know what’s going to happen in the next few months.” Nadal also had the unusual experience of being watched by active players, in competition at the French Open this year, who were in attendance at Court Philippe Chatrier to bear witness to his potentially final outing. “Happy that it happens, it means that I have a positive legacy here,” he said.",

        "content": "The Maharashtra government will not proceed with all the recommendations from the recently proposed Maharashtra State Curriculum Framework for School Education, said State Education Minister Deepak Kesarkar. The framework had stirred a controversy for using lines from Manusmriti as reference in one of the chapters in the draft, a move that Kesarkar clarified had not received governmental or the steering committee’s approval before being made public. Speaking at a press conference in Mumbai on Thursday, Kesarkar expressed regret in excluding Marathi as a compulsory language. “It happened because the draft was made public without following the proper procedure,” he said. Advertisement Kesarkar also said that the exclusion of English as a compulsory language for Class 11 and 12 was “because the government is working to offer higher education in regional languages, including technical education”. After the minister’s clarification, the SCERT issued a press release late Monday stating that Marathi and English language would be compulsory from Class 1 to 10. It also clarified that Hindi, Sanskrit and other Indian and foreign languages are being offered from Class 6, while Classes 11 and 12 students will have to learn two languages — one Indian and the other foreign. Last week, the State Council of Educational Research and Training unveiled the new Maharashtra State Curriculum Framework (SCF), advocating the integration of Indian Knowledge System (IKS) into School Education (SE). It proposed including texts such as the Bhagavad Gita and Manache Shlok — a composition by Samarth Ramdas Swami — for memorisation enhancement through recitation competitions. A chapter on “value education and disposition” from SCF, which aimed at character-building for students, sparked controversy as it began with a Sanskrit verse from Manusmriti, an ancient Hindu legal text describing the social system. This inclusion drew criticism from various quarters regarding the intent behind the decision. Advertisement Kesarkar addressed the issue, stating, “It was an error on the part of the steering committee that placed the draft in public domain without state government approval. The people involved have expressed regret for this. Let me make it clear, the government does not want to propagate any text and will not include any of this in textbooks.” After the matter came to light, several educationists questioned the decision to the Manusmriti reference. “There are numerous Sanskrit verses conveying similar meanings, yet the draft selects one from Manusmriti. This decision appears either politically naive or intentionally provocative, potentially offending certain segments of the society,” said a renowned educationist. While language policy for Classes 3 to 10 lacked clarity; for Classes 11 and 12, English was categorised as foreign language. Chhagan Bhujbal, Maharashtra Cabinet Minister, also expressed concerns, saying the inclusion of Manusmriti in the curriculum could send a wrong signal among Dalits and OBCs. “Such actions could impact us electorally. This initiative must be halted. Though seemingly insignificant now, it could pose future challenges,” Bhujbal said.",

The Atlantic hurricane season, starting in June is expected to be more active than usual due to near-record warm Atlantic Ocean temperatures and cooler surface water in the Pacific.",

        "content": "The Bombay High Court on Monday asked CIDCO to stall its move to remove the hoarding concerned and instead suggested they come up with a policy or regime for hoardings located within their jurisdiction or area. The court was hearing a plea by advertisement agencies challenging the notices issued by City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) to remove alleged illegal hoardings in Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area (NAINA). A vacation bench of Justices NR Borkar and Somasekhar Sundaresan also remarked that civic authorities said nothing to the advertising firms until the Ghatkopar hoarding collapse incident. Firms including Devangi Outdoor Advertising and Harmesh Dilip Tanna, proprietor of Gargee Graphics, had approached the High Court stating that CIDCO did not have the jurisdiction to send such notices. The petitioners claimed they had erected the hoardings legally after obtaining necessary permissions from authorities. Advertisement Despite this, they said they have received notices for removal of hoardings within 24 hours or face action under Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act (MRTP). As per petitioners, the authorities have warned them that if hoardings were not removed, they would dismantle them and recover costs from the owner. The notices by CIDCO come in wake of the collapse of a hoarding on a petrol pump in Ghatkopar on May 13, which killed 17 people. CIDCO purportedly issued notices to several hoarding owners after the unfortunate incident. Advocate for the petitioner firms, Mohsin Khan, argued that the notices were issued without a show-cause notice, which violated the principles of natural justice. Khan also claimed that authorities failed to verify the structural stability of the hoardings before issuing the notice, hence the action amounted to being arbitrary and ex-facie illegal. However, CIDCO’s lawyer submitted that the authority had issued notices to several owners of hoardings after discovering they had been installed without requisite permissions. The lawyer claimed that the same exercise was crucial as it was within the Navi Mumbai airport region. The corporation also claimed that the hoardings erected since 2018–19 had applied for permission in 2023, including those by the petitioners. Advertisement The bench sought to know if the authority had conducted any structural audit of all hoardings within its domain, and whether the authority was planning to bring a regime or policy in place for illegal hoardings within its area. These hoardings are not brought back to CIDCO, the bench said, and until the Ghatkopar incident, nobody said anything. In these circumstances, the bench asked if the corporation should at least not study whether the hoardings pose any danger, instead of bringing them down? “Have a reasonable policy view, otherwise case by case people will come. If you decide to demolish everything, that is also different. We are placing this on May 30. Till next date, if it is not pulled down, we are asking you to hold it,” the bench said.",

        "content": "The move by the National Assembly to replace the current national anthem with the former one through an expeditious legislative process suffered a setback on Monday. Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi, who attended a public hearing on the matter organized by the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, warned that the issue of the National Anthem, should not be treated with legislative fiat. He said as commendable as the move by both Chambers of the National Assembly may be, enacting a law on National Anthem or replacing the current with the old demands that, Nigerians are carried along. Fagbemi said: “In some cases, national anthem emerges from open national competition among interested citizens. In other instances, the proposed national anthem is subjected to plebiscite or referendum, before its eventual adoption or declaration. He argued that “The essence of the foregoing is to secure the buy-in and confidence of the people and to ensure that the anthem meets their collective aspirations and suits their contemporary socio-political conditions.” “Against the background of the foregoing, I am of the considered opinion that the revered issue of choice of a national item should not come into being only by legislative fiat, or presidential proclamation alone. According to him, “the decision to change Nigeria’s National Anthem whether by replacing it with the old one or a new one, should be subjected to a wider process of citizen participation through zonal public hearings, resolutions of the Federal Executive Council, Council of State, National and State Assemblies, etc. “The outcome of this process is bound to be a true reflection of the wishes of the generality or majority of Nigerians.” Former minority leader of the Senate, Eyinnaya Abaribe, said he was totally against the move because the second stanza of the National Anthem is the country’s national prayer. He also revealed that his senatorial district was totally against the move, as there are more pressing issues that require the attention of the Federal Government. He said: “While we support the efforts of the Federal Government under President Bola A. Tinubu to ameliorate the difficulties that Nigerians face today of biting inflation, crippling unemployment and widespread insecurity, we do not feel that it is a priority to embark on a homegrown National Anthem 46 years after its adoption by Nigerians. “The reasons given for such unseemly haste to revert back to the colonial era anthem ark rather nebulous and mostly self-serving. “Reverting to an anthem that harks back to our troubled past as a nation does not enhance unity. Rather it reminds us all of nomenclatures such as ‘Tribes, Tongues’, Natives’ which divides us as a nation and which led to the unfortunate civil war. “The present anthem has a second stanza that is used as our National Prayer. Thus, going back to the old anthem will make the nation be put even further apart as it will mean we will not have a National Prayer. The lawmaker contended that the present National Anthem was accompanied by a pledge which all children and patriots recite at official functions. “Will reverting back to the old anthem not mean abrogation of the pledge since they go together? He queried. “The peoples of Abia South Senatorial District are desirous of policies and plans to reduce the pump price of petrol from the present 1.000 naira per litre in Aba, the 224 naira per kWh of electricity, the more than 100% increase in food prices than going back to an anthem written by a colonial citizen of Britain and bequeathed to Nigerians at our independence in 1960. Therefore, the people of Abia South Senatorial District in their entirety reject the bill to revert back to the old anthem.” In his submission at the public hearing , the Minister of Information and National Orientation, Alhaji Mohammed Idris Malagi, recommended that the scope should be expanded to include a robust issue on national identity rather than limiting it to change of national anthem. The Minister who was represented by the Director-General of National Orientation Agency ( NOA) , Mr Lanre Issa-Onilu, noted that some lines in the old national anthem does not make a complete meaning. “The issue of national anthem is just a sub-sect. What we should be looking at is the National Identity Act. “The challenge we have today is that we do not have a value national identity which the national anthem is one of them. It is not about singing in schools, it is about learning it and imbibing it.” Also cautioning the National Assembly on expeditious passage of the bill, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), called for wider consultations for Nigerians to accept whatever National Anthem is proposed and buy into it . According to him, the National Assembly should widen the scope of participation in the process of coming up with such an Act for general acceptability . He however supported the move to replace the current “Arise O Compatriots National Anthem” with the “Nigeria, We Hail Thee”, the country started with, in October 1960. He said such a move was long overdue since the current National Anthem adopted in 1978 , does not have the required gravitas and not inspirational to fire the passion and zeal for Nationhood among Nigerians. Nigeria, according to him, will not be the first country in the world to replace current National Anthem with the old one as over 20 countries like Russia, Austria, Chile, France, Saudi Arabia, China, Brazil, Iran, Iraq etc, have done so at different times in the past.

        "content": "Was Johnny Wactor Married? Wife, Family Details and Cause of Death Revealed By Johnny Wactor’s death has left many deeply shocked. The talented actor was most well known for his role in General Hospital and many fans are curious about the actor’s personal life in the wake of his sudden death. Here are all the details of his personal life and what happened to him. Did Johnny Wactor have a wife? No, John Wactor wasn’t married and didn’t have a wife. Wactor had always kept his personal life away from the public eye, making fans curious whether he was in a relationship or not. As per , in 2022, he was allegedly linked with Kaitlin Sullivan, following their posted close moments on his social media handle. The two never openly confirmed their low-key relationship. Their shared images also now seem to be deleted, indicating that they might have parted ways earlier. Moreover, it was reportedly known that he was single and was focused on his acting career before his untimely death. Johnny Wactor cause of death As per , Johnny Wactor died when he was shot by one of the three suspects who came to rob a vehicle’s catalytic converter on Saturday near Pica Boulevard and Hope Street. Wactor’s mother Scarlett spoke with and gave out details on what happened to her son. She revealed that he and his co-worker were returning from their bartending duties at a rooftop bar around 3 am or 3:30 am. That’s when they saw three men whom he thought were towing his car. However, when Wactor interrupted them, a masked man shot him. Wactor was quickly taken to a local hospital. However, it was too late by then and he didn’t survive. Johnny Wactor’s death was confirmed by his agent David Shaul in an official statement, released by Variety, where he shared his kind words. “Johnny Wactor was a spectacular human being. Not just a talented actor who was committed to his craft but a real moral example to everyone who knew him. Standing for hard work, tenacity and a never give up attitude. In the highs and lows of a challenging profession he always kept his chin up and kept striving for the best he could be. Our time with Johnny was a privilege we would wish on everyone. He would literally give you the shirt off his back. After over a decade together, he will leave a hole in our hearts forever,” Shaul said. The police have opened an investigation and are on the search for the three suspects, who ran away from the crime scene. Shazmeen is a writer, entertainment journalist, and movie aficionado at core. She holds a degree in multimedia and mass communication, specializing in advertising, but her ardor for cinema led her into entertainment journalism. While her cinematic preferences know no bounds, she specifically has fondness for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, psychological thrillers, horror, and films with profound philosophical undertones.

        "content": "Katie Price shared a post detailing 'five reasons the narcissist hates you' months after her split from Carl Woods. The former glamour model, who is currently dating Married At First Sight UK star JJ Slater, was previously engaged to Love Island star Carl. The duo were in an on-ff relationship since they first started dating in 2020. They were believed to have split up again in November last year but sparked reconciliation rumours the following month when they were seen together . Not long after, Katie was seen enjoying cosy nights out with JJ before confirming their relationship on social media. Katie, who doesn't shy away from sharing cryptic posts about her exes, recently took to her social media to share a post about narcissism on her Stories. The post read: \"Five reasons the narcissist hates you: 1. You've stopped falling for their lies 2. They've lost the control they once had over you 3. You've cracked their facade and see them for who they really are 4. You're no longer desperate for their approval 5. Their schemes and tricks don't work on you anymore.\" Katie shared a new post about narcissism on her page ( Image: Instagram/ @katieprice) The duo, who were in an on-off relationship for a few years, split last year ( Image: Getty Images) Back in February, Carl made a few digs about the split as he praised himself for getting himself through the tough period. Carl vowed to keep a 'low profile' and focus on himself after the breakup. Taking to his Instagram stories, the former Love Island star made a number of digs at his ex-fiancée. In one story post, Carl showed off his adorable new puppy as he joked that his new pet pooch was 'doing his head in'. However, he also commended his dog's immense 'loyalty' as he said it was the 'most important thing'. In another story, Carl re-shared an inspirational video which said: \"God knows when to send you exactly what you need. Being private, staying low-key, and not telling everyone everything is self-care. Seek respect, not attention.\" Carl then appeared to reference his split with Katie as he re-shared yet another inspirational video. \"I love you enough to let you go,\" the video started. \"Go find that person that you say is better than me. Everything hurts when you love somebody. I love for real.\" Meanwhile, Carl and Katie's other ex Kieran Hayler united at Silver Leas Polo in Hertfordshire and looked all smiles as they shared a video of their outing on social media. However, one of their mutual pals present couldn't help but point out the meeting was \"awkward\", while jokingly putting a hand to their mouth as the camera panned around. This isn't the first time Kieran and Carl spend time together as they previously celebrated Easter Sunday as a duo - which allegedly left their famous ex furious.

        "description": "At her wit's end after serious ongoing health problems couldn't produce a treatment or accurate diagnosis, one myeloma patient tells Minreet Kaur about her struggle to get her doctors to listen",
        "content": "Fatigued, breathless, filled with constant aches and pains in her ribs, and entirely lacking in energy, sales assistant Pritpal Kaur knew she was deeply unwell. “I could have slept all day,” says the 73 year old from Hillingdon, West London, of her symptoms, which began in May 2023. “I was back and forth to my GP surgery telling them about what was happening to me, but they offered no solutions.” Then one morning, things took a dramatic turn. “I couldn’t move at all,” says Pritpal. “I was meant to get up for work but I was in so much agony I was screaming. My daughter Minreet helped me to slowly get out of the bed and took me straight to the GP, who finally saw I was in so much pain that I was sent to A&E.” There, preliminary tests and scans found nothing, so Pritpal was sent home with a referral for an ultrasound to check for gallstones, which also came back clear. “At this point I couldn’t even take a full breath,” she recalls. “Eventually I was sent for a CT scan, which showed a narrowing of one artery, so I was diagnosed with mild angina and given blood thinners, but I continued to feel worse and worse.” Dunelm's 'most comfortable' hanging egg chair is 'perfect for British weather' \"Cancer really just wasn’t on my radar\" ( Image: COLLECT) Over the next few months, Pritpal developed severe lower back pain and cramps all over her body. “I went back to my GP yet again. This time I was fobbed off with the line that it was all down to old age and arthritis . “That just didn’t make sense to me. A few months before, I had been fit and active. I had run the London Marathon in April that year, so I knew it had to be something more serious.” At her wits’ end, in August Pritpal put in a complaint with PALS (the Patient Advice and Liaison Service), which offers confidential advice, support and information on health-related matters, at her local hospital. After explaining her symptoms once more, and that she felt she was getting worse, the cardiology team assessed her again and confirmed angina wasn’t the root of her issues. Returning to her GP surgery in tears of pain, Pritpal was sent for a blood test that picked up irregularities, while a bone density scan uncovered lesions and holes. An urgent referral to the hospital’s haematology department followed. “Despite all my symptoms, hearing the doctor talking about blood cancer was still a huge shock. I’d never heard of myeloma before. He said they would need to do a bone marrow test to confirm the diagnosis, but I still believed I would be given the all clear,” says Pritpal. “I am such an active person, I eat healthily, I’m a vegetarian and don’t drink. Cancer really just wasn’t on my radar.” There are over 24,000 people living with myeloma in the UK, with about 5,900 people diagnosed each year. According to Myeloma UK, 50 per cent of those with the cancer waited over five months for a diagnosis, with 31 per cent diagnosed via an emergency route such as a trip to A&E. Pritpal with her husband Rajinder ( Image: BBC) These are some of the longest delays out of any cancer in the UK. Pritpal waited over two weeks for her bone marrow results and when they came, in September 2023, the news was not good. “In an instant, my life turned upside down,” she recalls. “I just thought ‘this is the end of my life – how will my husband, Rajinder, cope?’ “I was told that if I didn’t have chemotherapy my bones would crack and I could go into kidney failure and die. If I’m honest, I didn’t want to have the treatment. I was scared because in the Asian community there’s a lot of negativity around chemo, but I spoke to my family and decided it was the best thing to do.” Myeloma is currently an incurable cancer, although treatment can be very effective at controlling the disease. Seven months on, consultants are telling Pritpal she has responded really well. “I hope there is light at the end of the tunnel as I continue on the treatment which is for life,” she says. “I just want to get back to walking and swimming, and be back at work. I miss my colleagues and having some kind of normality.” Unsurprisingly, Pritpal says she is still angry at the delays she experienced in her diagnosis. “I could have been diagnosed much earlier,” she says. “ I now have a hunchback and have lost height because of the damage the cancer has done. I wasn’t checked for myeloma, even though I had all the symptoms.” Pritpal is now campaigning to raise awareness of cancer, particularly among the Asian community where, she says, “It is a taboo – cancer isn’t talked about. “When I told people I had myeloma, some wouldn’t give me a hug and some even stopped talking to me. It’s as if they feel it’s contagious. It has been really hard. People I thought would be there for me didn’t even ask how I was. It’s an isolating place to be. “Cancer is tough to live with, but it’s even harder when you are from a community where there is so little understanding of it. Some won’t tell others if they have it because they feel they will be judged. There are others who mistrust the NHS and put off getting checked for symptoms. I would have left it too if I hadn’t been in so much pain. “We need to speak up more and help others. Raising awareness is so important. I would hate for someone else to be in my position. If something doesn’t feel right, get it checked.” For more information, visit Myeloma UK at myeloma.org.uk, or call their infoline on 0800 980 3332 Frankie Bridge fans obsessed with 'amazing' £45 linen River Island dress",

        "content": "Speaking in a recent interview with , the Newcastle-born footballer was asked which stadium he would love to play in and the Ipswich star responded with “St James’ Park”. Davis continued by saying: “It’s incredible how it’s turned around, everyone up there in Newcastle is so happy at the minute.” When asked if his biggest ambition is to play for the Magpies, the defender responded by saying “Definitely.” Newcastle have been linked with a move for Davis in recent months with stating that the Tyneside club and West Ham are keeping an eye on the 24-year-old as a result of the impressive season he has had at Portman Road. The left-back has featured in 44 matches for Ipswich this season, producing two goals and an eye-catching 21 assists. With a contract expiring in 2025, a big offer could see Ipswich sell the star, and it remains to be seen if Newcastle make the defender’s dreams come true. Newcastle interested in Ipswich Town’s Leif Davis Left-back has been a problematic position for Eddie Howe this season with the Magpies boss often having to play Dan Burn in the role due to a lack of options. Howe began to trust Lewis Hall towards the end of the campaign and the 19-year-old responded positively. The defender is set to join Newcastle permanently from Chelsea this summer and that will hamper any potential deal for Davis. The Tyneside club have no need for the Ipswich star at present unless the full-back is happy to play a support role.",

        "content": "CHENNAI: Mitchell Starc bowled a sensational opening spell to fire Kolkata Knight Riders to their third Indian Premier League title with a eight-wicket thrashing of Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Sunday final. Kolkata bowled out Hyderabad for IPL’s lowest total of 113 in a final as Australia’s left-arm quick Starc returned figures of 2-14 to live up to his top billing in the world’s most lucrative T20 tournament. Starc went to Kolkata for a record $2.98 million in the December auction and ended the IPL with two stellar performances, including a match-winning 3-34 in the first play-off to hammer the same opponent. Kolkata’s batsmen had it easy and despite Sunil Narine’s early departure, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, who made 39, and Venkatesh Iyer, on 52 not out, helped the team home with 9.3 overs to spare after a partnership of 91. Iyer, a left-handed batsman, reached his 50 in 24 balls and hit the winning runs to trigger celebrations for Kolkata, who remained the most dominant team after they ended top of the table with 20 points in the league phase. Skipper Shreyas Iyer was unbeaten on six, and at the other end, when Kolkata players came rushing on to the pitch and the stadium fireworks went off. “Great night for KKR. What a game, what a season,” player-of-the-match Starc said. “Probably the two most exciting teams in the final. We have had a fantastic squad of bowlers and batters, our staff have been fantastic to get everyone peaking.” On the pressure of his high price tag, 34-year-old Starc said: “There’s been jokes about the money. I am experienced, that’s helped with all the expectations.” Players and national teams now move into the T20 World Cup starting June 1 in the West Indies and the United States. ‘Mom is watching’ Afghanistan’s Gurbaz, who left the tournament midway through to be with his ailing mother back home and returned for the play-offs, said: “My mom is watching from home. “She is feeling good now. I asked mom before the match if she wanted anything. She said just the win,” added the wicket-keeper-batsman. Kolkata’s co-owner and Bollywood superstar actor Shah Rukh Khan was in attendance and congratulated his champion players after he suffered from a heat-related illness in the first qualifier in Ahmedabad. It was Kolkata’s second title triumph at the venue, after they won their first trophy in 2012, and a near-capacity crowd at the 36,000-seater stadium cheered on. Narine, a left-hand batsman and a right-arm spinner, ended as the player of the series with 488 runs as an opener and 17 wickets. Gambhir effect Apart from the big signing of Starc, they got Gautam Gambhir as mentor after the former India batsman led the team to their first two titles, including in 2014. Hyderabad skipper Pat Cummins won the toss and elected to bat first and go with his team’s strength of scoring big, after they racked up IPL record totals of 277 and 287 in this year’s edition. Hyderabad took Cummins for $2.5 million in the same auction and made him captain after he led Australia to two titles, including the World Test Championship and the ODI World Cup last year. “So many (positives), the style with which the guys played especially with the bat. Lot of skills to get to 250 three times,” said Cummins. “I loved how brave the guys were. It was a lot of fun, great season.” But it was Starc who took the limelight as he struck in his first over when he bowled in-form Indian batsman Abhishek Sharma, for two, on a delivery that pitched in the middle and caught the top of off stump. Travis Head followed his fellow left-hand opener Abhishek to the dug-out, caught behind for his second duck in three matches off fast bowler Vaibhav Arora. Starc struck again and the opposition top-order was in disarray at 47-4 inside seven overs. Andre Russell took down Aiden Markram for 20 and wickets kept tumbling as fellow South African Heinrich Klaasen fell for 16. Cummins, who was dropped on 10 by Starc, took the team past 100 before falling for 24 off Russell, who ended with figures of 3-19. — AFP",

        "content": "Following the U.S. imposing tariffs on electric vehicles, Canada might be looking at doing something similar. In an interview with CBC , Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry of Canada François-Philippe Champagne said that the Canadian government isn’t ruling out imposing tariffs on Chinese EVs. Following that, industry leaders from various automotive manufacturing arms in Canada have also expressed a desire for Canada to follow through on this. This may lead to pressure on the cabinet to impose similar tariffs as the U.S. Other parts of the world, like Europe, have seen their auto markets change lately as low-cost EVs made in China hit the market. China has stronger programs and incentives, along with potentially cheaper labour, which has allowed it to expand quickly into the EV space. Since most other automakers are focusing on high-end EVs instead, the market is jumping on the opportunity to go electric for a reasonable price. In a bid to protect its giant auto industry of 39 million workers, the U.S. has imposed stronger tariffs on Chinese EVs to keep prices in line with American-made competition. While Canada’s auto industry is much smaller at 500,000 workers, there is still a precedent from the U.S. that we impose something similar. Source: CBC , Global News",

        "content": "SAN DIEGO — In the highest-scoring final game in Mountain West Championship history, Fresno State’s offensive explosion at the plate was too much for San Jose State in a 16-11 slugfest on Sunday afternoon at Tony Gwynn Stadium. The Diamond ‘Dogs captured their second MW tournament title in program history and their first since 2019. The Bulldogs (33-27) secured the MW’s automatic bid in the NCAA playoffs with the victory. On Friday, they will face host and No. 14 national seed UC Santa Barbara (42-12) of the Big West in a first-round game. The Bulldogs had to overcome four home runs and seven RBI from Hunter Dorraugh of San Jose State (24-33) to win the title game. It was quite a turnaround for Fresno State, which fell 3-2 in the tournament opener to Air Force on Thursday and extended its losing streak to six straight. The Bulldogs staved off elimination with a 6-1 win over New Mexico on Friday. The next day, they sent regular-season champion Air Force home with a 10-3 win and forced the NCAA-deciding tournament berth rematch with San Jose State by dropping the Spartans 8-5. Sunday’s Bulldog Heroes Tyler Davis and Justin Stransky brought in half of Fresno State’s runs as both went 3-for-5 with four RBIs. Jaykob Acosta got the win, striking out seven and allowing one run in 3 2⁄3 innings in relief of Jake Dixon, who started his second game of the MW tournament. Murf Gray was named the MW Championship Most Valuable Player. The sophomore was 11-for-21 at the plate in five games, driving in seven RBIs and scoring eight runs. Seven of his 11 hits went for extra bases, recording five doubles and two home runs. Gray was joined on the All-Tournament Team by Acosta, Stransky, Noah Beal, Tommy Hopfe, and Jake Riding. The title game box score is . How It Happened The Spartan offense got going early, scoring the first run of the game with a solo home run in the bottom of the first. A double down the left-field line almost allowed the Spartans to score another run, but the relay from Bobby Blanford to Gray to Davis, the catcher, was in time to get the runner out at home. Fresno State’s bats got hot in the third as Michael McKernan doubled down the left-field line with two outs on the board. Ben Newton drove in McKernan, a single to right field, and crossed the plate himself after a two-run bomb from Hopfe. Blandford and Stransky hit back-to-back home runs in the fourth to keep the Diamond ‘Dog offense rolling. San Jose State responded with a solo shot to center field in the bottom of the frame to halve the Bulldogs lead at 6-3. The hits kept coming in the fifth as Grady Morgan doubled to bring in Hopfe. Singles from Davis and Stransky plated another three runs as the advantage grew to eight. Acosta sent the Spartans down in order in the bottom of the fifth, finishing it with back-to-back strikeouts. Fresno State batted around in the sixth. The ‘Dogs loaded the bases with no outs. Eddie Saldivar hit a sacrifice fly to center to bring in McKernan. After Morgan was hit by a pitch, a single from Gray brought in Newton. With a 2-0 count, Davis ripped a shot down the left line to clear the bases. A pitching change did not cool the bats as Blandford singled and Stransky doubled to score Davis. After the Bulldogs were held scoreless in the ninth, Hopfe allowed back-to-back singles to start the bottom of the inning. The senior closer then shut the door with a pair of flyouts bookending a strikeout.",

        "description": "A Mirror poll has revealed the public want rapid action to stop kids accessing harmful content on social media, as Molly Russell's dad says it's a 'matter of life or death'",
        "content": "Social media firms should be forced almost immediately to stop children seeing harmful content, voters have demanded. A Mirror poll has revealed the public want rapid action to prevent algorithms bombarding kids with material relating to suicide and eating disorders. Six in 10 (60%) want this to happen by the end of July, while a further 22% said it should be before the end of this year. Just 2% were against it, according to the survey conducted by Whitestone Insight. Most people are also in favour of forcing online giants to introduce robust age checks on social media, such as requiring photo ID. Some 43% want this by the summer, while 26% believe it should be in place by the end of this year. Only 8% say they’re happy to wait until some point next year. Just 8% were against the proposal. The idea of banning under-16s from having smartphones is not widely supported, however. Some 43% are against, while 36% are in favour. Ofcom has put forward proposals that would require tech firms to stop their algorithms recommending harmful content to children and introduce robust age checks. But the regulator has said its final code may not be published until summer 2025, after which companies will have three months to assess the guidance. Parliament will need to approve the code, which could also take time. The dad of Molly Russell , who took her own life at age 14 in 2017 after being exposed to harmful content online, last night said the issue was a “matter of life or death” as he responded to the poll findings. Molly Russell took her own life at age 14 in 2017 after being exposed to harmful content online ( Image: PA) The Online Safety Act was originally proposed by Theresa May in 2019 but it took years to become law due to political chaos and divisions over the legislation. While it finally became law in October, Ofcom can't use new powers to hold social media firms to account until the end of a lengthy consultation on updating its guidance. Ofcom earlier this month published its draft Children’s Safety Codes of Practice, which sets out more than 40 practical measures tech giants must implement to meet new legal duties. If tech companies fail to comply with the guidance when it is introduced, they could be fined up to 10% of their global turnover or have their services blocked in the UK. The mother of murdered teen Brianna Ghey has warned that more young lives could be lost due to delays to the social media crackdown. Earlier this month, Esther Ghey told the Mirror : “I totally understand Ofcom’s view that we need to cross the Ts and dot the Is, and everything needs to be perfect so social media companies can’t come back and take legal action. But during this time we’re potentially losing more children’s lives. Also, there are children who are struggling with their mental health, there are children who are self-harming and we do need to try to get this done as soon as possible.” Whitestone Insight interviewed 2,024 adults in Britain online on May 15 and 16. 'There is no time to waste,' says dad who lost his daughter The dad of a 14-year-old girl who took her own life after being exposed to harmful content online says it is a “matter of life or death” whether a clampdown on social media takes place urgently. Molly Russell’s father Ian said there is “no time to waste” as he responded to our exclusive poll findings. Molly, from Harrow, in north west London, saw more than 2,000 harmful posts about suicide, self-harm and depression in the last six months of her life. Mr Russell said: “It’s only effective regulation that will finally make big tech address the preventable harm they cause to children and families. The cost of years of industry inaction should be measured in lost young lives, and that’s why getting world-leading regulation in force is nothing less than a matter of life or death.” Molly Russell's dad Ian warned there is no time to waste ( Image: Daily Mirror) The campaigner added: “There is no time to waste to protect young people from harm. Social media companies have consistently put their bottom line before taming toxic algorithms and the results have been devastating. The next Government should commit to new legislation to strengthen the Online Safety Act regime as this will ensure we see the swiftest and most decisive change. Effort wasted on other, hastily conceived policies is unlikely to be as effective and may end up causing more harm than good.” An inquest in 2022 concluded that Molly died from an act of self-harm while suffering depression and the negative effects of online content. Coroner Andrew Walker said the images of self-harm and suicide she viewed \"shouldn't have been available for a child to see\". *If you're struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open 24/7 on 116 123.

The cattle were bunched up around the trailer and it hit them all,” county coroner George Crocket said, as reported by the Colorado Sun . The outlet noted that Morgan’s father-in-law and wife were both in the vicinity and survived. They had spent the early part of the day branding cattle. By early afternoon storm clouds engulfed the sky as they were feeding the herd. Crocket described the incident as unusually deadly. “I’ve seen horses get killed, but it’s usually one at a time,” he said, according to the Sun . He added that his grandfather once lost seven cattle to a lightning strike. The outlet described Morgan as an outspoken rancher who was vocal about issues stemming from the reintroduction of wolves in the area. “We need to get our way of life out to the people because they don’t understand our livelihood, the emotional impact and the financial impact,” he said in 2022. Elsewhere in the country over the weekend, more than two dozen tornadoes touched down in five states, killing at least 20 people and injuring scores more. Texas was especially impacted, with more than 100 injuries reported and disasters declared in 106 counties, the Associated Press noted . In Cooke County, two young children from the same family were fatally wounded. Deaths were also reported in Oklahoma and Arkansas, with additional twisters sighted in Missouri and Kansas. Arkansas also suffered from a landslide over the weekend that off traffic on some sections of a highway in both directions.",

(Herald file photo) Prince Albert Carlton will have a new MLA following the next election after Joe Hargrave announced he would not seek re-election. Hargrave made the announcement Monday morning. He was originally acclaimed as the PA Carlton candidate in November 2023. “My family and I have given this a lot of consideration and have decided I just can’t commit to another four years as MLA,” Hargrave said in a statement. “I want to thank my family, friends, and most importantly, the constituents of Prince Albert Carlton for your support over the past eight years. It has been an honour to serve you and to serve with Premier Moe and all my caucus colleagues.” The Saskatchewan Party said it would nominate a new candidate “in the coming weeks.” Hargrave was the owner/operator of Riverside Auto Group in Prince Albert and served as a manager with BMO for 20 years before entering provincial politics. He was first elected in the 2016 provincial election, then re-elected in 2020. Hargrave served in a number of portfolios during his time in office, most recently as Minister of SaskBuilds and Procurement and Minister responsible for the GTH and Provincial Archives of Saskatchewan. He also served as Minister of Highways before resigning the position in 2021 following complaints about a trip he took to California to prepare to sell a piece of property during the COVID-19 outbreak. The Saskatchewan Party has 28 of 48 candidates nominated. Hargrave is the 14th sitting Sask. Party MLA who is not seeking re-election. -Advertisement-",

        "content": "There was nothing that could’ve gotten her to do more “tool time.” Patricia Richardson, who starred in “Home Improvement” as family matriarch Jill Taylor, shared that she used the large pay gap between her and Tim Allen to get out of shooting another season of the hit ABC show. The 73-year-old made it clear at the time that Season 8, which they filmed in 1998, would be her last. “I told everybody, there’s not enough money in the world to get me to do a ninth year. This show is over. It needs to end,” she told the LA Times . According to the outlet, both Richardson and Allen, 70, agreed that it was time to end the beloved show — but ABC made an offer to get them both to come back for a a 25-episode ninth season. The network offered $1 million per episode for Richardson and $2 million per episode for Allen, and, according to Richardson, Allen was all for accepting the offer. Richardson claimed she countered, telling the network that she’d stay if they agreed to pay her the same $2 million per episode that Allen was offered. “I knew that Disney would in no way pay me that much. That was my way to say ‘no’ and was a little bit of a flip-off to Disney,” she said. “I’d been there all this time, and they never even paid me a third of what Tim was making, and I was working my ass off. I was a big reason why women were watching.” As she expected, the offer was turned down, resulting in the show ending in 1999 with Season 8. But this series of events led to tension between her and her co-star. “I was mad at Tim because he was leaving me alone being the only person saying no, which made me feel terrible and like the bad guy,” she said, “and he was upset with me for leaving.” The Post has reached out to Allen’s rep for comment. “Home Improvement” co-creator and executive producer Carmen Finestra, meanwhile, told the LA Times that he couldn’t “remember one discussion” about continuing the show without Richardson. “It just couldn’t have worked,” he said. Executive producer Elliot Shoenman added, “Without her, it just didn’t make any sense.” Allen and Richardson reportedly don’t keep in touch, but the pair reunited in 2015 to film two episodes of his series “Last Man Standing.” She praised his talent to the Times and said she “never stopped loving working with him.” Richardson also recently responded to Allen’s claims that the entire “Home Improvement” cast was on board for a reboot, saying she was never asked about the possibility. “It was so weird. I would hear he was coming out publicly and saying this stuff about everyone was on board to do a ‘Home Improvement’ reunion, but he never asked me and he never asked [series co-star] Jonathan [Taylor Thomas],” Richardson said on an episode of the “Back to the Best” podcast. “I called Jonathan one day and said, ‘Has he asked you about this?’ He went, ‘No,’ ” she said of Thomas, who played her son Randy on the sitcom. “So why is he saying everyone is on board when he hasn’t talked to you or me?” Richardson said about her conversation with Thomas.",

He's born for this situation. He's born for the clutch situations, so we just give the ball to him.\" Irving and Dončić both scored 33 points in Game 3, but the former saved his best for when the lights shined the brightest down the final stretch. Kyrie Irving Fourth Quarter Game 3 Stats Points 14 FG 5-7 3FG 1-1 Dončić was not too shabby himself, knocking down all three of his shots in the final frame for seven points. Throughout the series, Irving averages 10.3 points on 50 percent shooting from the field, while Dončić puts up nine points on 64.3 percent. This star backcourt has two of the best closers in the NBA, and they are putting on a show in the 2024 playoffs. In Game 2, Irving missed two key free throws inside the final two minutes. Instead of feeling sorry for letting the team down, he from the left corner to make it a one-possession game.

Irving and Dončić's Leadership Helps Young Mavericks No team has ever lost a playoff matchup after being up 3-0. However, Irving says the Mavericks cannot focus on statistics.

        "content": "Food · Posted 1 minute ago There Are More Than 300 KitKat Flavors In Japan — Here Are The Top 19 You Absolutely Must Try At Least Once Green Tea KitKats are a must. by Jen Shiori Adams BuzzFeed Contributor Link Facebook Pinterest Twitter Mail Japan is one of the biggest food capitals in the world, so it makes sense that they'd have over 300 varieties of KitKats sold in stores across the country. I know that choosing from 300 different flavors might sound a bit overwhelming, so I've tried my best to narrow it down for you. As someone who has tried dozens of KitKat flavors, here are my recommendations for the 19 you need to try at least once: 1. Otona no Amasa Nestlé / Oyatsu Cafe / Via youtube.com It felt necessary to start this list by mentioning that Japan has a line of KitKats that is catered to the mature palettes of grownups. Otona no Amasa literally translates to \"sweetness for adults,\" and it's basically a lower sugar version of the classic KitKats. What's unique about this collection is there are several flavors offered, including dark chocolate, strawberry, matcha, white chocolate, raspberry, and caramel, so if you're not a fan of super sweet chocolates, look no further. 2. Strawberry Nestlé / Grub Exotic / Giphy / Via giphy.com If you love sweet, fruity candies, you'll love these KitKats. The strawberry flavor tastes exactly like the bits you would find in a cereal like Cap'n Crunch's Crunch Berries. The photo above is part of the Otona no Amasa collection so it's a less sweet version, but the classic strawberry flavor is sold in most stores across the country. 3. Sake Nestlé / KitKat Japan / Via kitkatjapan.com I'll admit I was a little hesitant to try sake-flavored KitKats, but they were surprisingly pretty good. The taste of sake is present yet subtle, so even those who don't like the distinct flavor of the rice wine would enjoy it. Plus, the uniqueness of this flavor makes for a great gift to bring back to your friends. 4. Gold Jen Adams Gold KitKats are a combination of the original milk chocolate and caramel-flavored KitKats. Both flavors are already good on their own, but something truly magical happens when you eat the two of them together. 5. Strawberry Short Cake Jen Adams Fun fact: Strawberry short cake is a really popular dessert in Japan because it's red and white, like the Japanese flag. Interesting, right? These KitKats are made of white chocolate swirled with freeze-dried strawberry bits, sandwiched in between wafers and a layer of sweet cream. Compared to the classic strawberry-flavored KitKats, they're a little more tart (from the freeze-dried strawberry pieces). But don't worry, the tartness balances out perfectly from the sweetness of the white chocolate. 6. Chocolate Orange Jen Adams Whoever invented chocolate orange-flavored KitKats needs an immediate raise because these are delicious. I was honestly a little shocked at how much I liked these; chocolate and oranges don't really sound like the best combination. But apparently, these KitKats taste like Terry's chocolate orange candies that are sold in the UK, although I've never tried those, so I can't confirm or deny. 7. Cookies & Cream Nestlé / Yami Buy / Via yamibuy.com If you've ever tried a Hershey's Cookies 'n' Creme Bar , you'll know how delicious the flavors of white chocolate and cookies can be. Now, imagine that with an added wafer in the middle, and you have a Cookies & Cream KitKat. Definitely a must-try for those who love chocolates on the sweeter side. 8. Ume Nestlé / Grub Exotic / Giphy / Via giphy.com Ume-flavored KitKats are a seasonal spring treat. If you aren't familiar with Ume, it's a Japanese plum that's usually pickled, dried, or fermented before eating. I'll admit, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when I tried these for the first time, but they had an interesting flavor for sure. They're sweet, tangy, and just one of those weird flavors you have to try at least once. 9. Apple Pie Nestlé / Japan Candy Store / Via japancandystore.com Another seasonal flavor that's only available in the fall is apple pie. Think of the dessert's cinnamon-y sweetness, and now imagine that in chocolate form. It's amazing. 10. Café Latte Nestlé / Rocket Fizz Lancaster / Via rocketfizzlancasterca.com If you used to be obsessed with mocha Frappucinos like I was, you have to try these. 11. Lucky Red & White Jen Adams Lucky Red & Whites are a combination of white chocolate and milk chocolate KitKats. While that might not sound super exciting or relevant to their name, here's a quick ✨sociology lesson✨: In the late '90s, KitKat Japan gained popularity with students after branding themselves as the \"antidote\" to stress and anxiety during final exam season. So, from a consumer perspective, these little chocolates have been associated with good luck for a long time. Plus, the Japanese pronunciation of KitKat (Kittokatto) sounds almost identical to a Kyushu dialect term, Kittokatsutoo, meaning \"you will definitely win.\" These things prompted KitKat to come out with the Lucky Red & White KitKats. There's a little red and white knot symbol on its packaging, which symbolizes good luck in Japanese culture. Each of these individually wrapped KitKats have a different good luck omen on them, so they make for a special snack. 12. Hojicha Tea Nestlé / KitKat Japan / Via kitkatjapan.com If you love the taste of Matcha KitKats, I would highly recommend giving the Hojicha-flavored ones a try. Hojicha and matcha are both green teas, but their preparation styles are different, which gives them their own distinct flavors. Hojicha tastes a lot nuttier, so it tastes really nice as a KitKat. 13. Wasabi Nestlé / Tokyo Lens / Via youtube.com Wasabi-flavored KitKats might not be the first thing that comes to mind when it comes to dessert, but — as the saying goes — don't knock it 'til you try it. The spiciness of the Wasabi is only subtle and definitely not potent enough to clear your sinuses. 14. Matcha Tiramisu Nestlé / Grub Exotic / Giphy / Via giphy.com I've personally never actually tried this flavor, but I have no doubts that this KitKat would heal something in me. The description calls out the perfectly balanced flavors of mascarpone cheese and bittersweet matcha, which sounds amazing. BRB, filing this under my list of reasons I need to go to Japan this summer. 15. Rum Raisin Nestlé / TheJapanChannelDCom / Via youtube.com Like Rum Raisin ice cream , but in chocolate form. 16. Whole Wheat Biscuit Nestlé / PapiEats / Via youtube.com If you take anything away from this list, let it be about how underrated this flavor is. Whole Wheat Biscuit KitKats are inspired by the taste of English digestive biscuits, and they're coated with a sweet white chocolate. The wafers are made from whole wheat flour and toasted grains. What's interesting is this flavor was created to encourage more healthy grains into people's diets. 17. Milk Tea Jen Adams Another British-inspired flavor, Milk Tea KitKats are the perfect dessert to bring to your next tea party. The black tea extract and white chocolate really balance each other out, so you get a nice, subtle tea flavor. 18. Sweet Potato Nestlé / KitKat Japan / Via kitkatjapan.com These KitKats are inspired by Yaki-imo (roasted sweet potato), which is a pretty common snack in Japan. They kind of remind me of the taste of roasted chestnuts; they're a little nutty yet still pretty sweet. Definitely worth a try. 19. And finally, Umeshu (Plum Wine) Nestlé / KitKat Japan / Via kitkatjapan.com Last but not least, we have Umeshu, or plum wine. Yes, they're a little similar to the Ume KitKats mentioned earlier, but the plum flavor is more mellow in this. Both flavors are good, but this one is better for those who aren't fans of strong fruity flavors.

        "description": "Three people will receive honorary degrees, and two others will be named Fellows of the University at convocation ceremonies this week.",
        "content": "THUNDER BAY — When Lakehead University marks the achievements of nearly 2,000 graduates at its Thunder Bay campus later this week, it will also recognize five individuals for their unique contributions to their fields and to their communities. Lakehead announced Monday that it will confer honorary degrees on Rosie Mosquito, Dr. Samantha Nutt and Patricia Ningewance Nadeau, and will name two other people Fellows of the University. Honorary degree recipients: Rosie Mosquito, a member of Bearskin Lake First Nation, has devoted her life to community development, political advocacy and the advancement of Indigenous rights. In 1986, she became the first female chief in the western part of Nishnawbe Aski Nation. The university stated in its announcement that she has navigated the intricacies of government throughout her career, leveraging her expertise to champion Indigenous causes. She served as executive director of NAN from 1994 to 1996, and has held other pivotal roles including senior policy advisor to the Ontario Regional Chief and executive director of Oshki Wenjack Education Training Institute from 2004 to 2018. One of her proudest accomplishments is the passing of the Indigenous Institutes Act in 2017, provincial legislation that was negotiated during the nine years she chaired the Indigenous Institute Consortium. Mosquito remains an active participant in NAN, with the Chiefs of Ontario and with the Assembly of First Nations. Dr. Samantha Nutt is an award-winning humanitarian, bestselling author and founder and president of War Child U.S.A. and War Child Canada. The university said she has worked for over two decades with children and their families on the frontlines of many international crises, including in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone and Darfur, Sudan. Dr. Nutt is a leading authority on public health, war, international aid and foreign policy, and is an acclaimed public speaker in North America. She is also a staff physician at Women's College Hospital in Toronto, and an assistant professor at the University of Toronto. She previously received the Order of Canada, the country's highest civilian honour. The university stated that her international work has benefited millions of war-affected children. Patricia Ningewance Nadeau (Waabibizhikiikwe) is Bear Clan from Lac Seul First Nation and a survivor of the residential school system. She is a translator, Ojibwe author, and teacher, and her company – Mazinaate – has been publishing Indigenous books and resources since 1998. An assistant professor at the University of Manitoba, she is actively involved in promoting and preserving the Ojibwe language. According to the university, her grandson speaks and teaches Ojibwe, while her son is director of operations at Dakota Ojibwe Tribal Council, and is a producer of the Ojibwe language version for the Star Wars film A New Hope . Her husband is a former lawyer and a future fluent speaker of Ojibwe. Patricia Ningewance Nadeau was honoured with the Order of Canada in 2022. Fellows of the University: Walberg has been an ambassador for Lakehead University for over two decades, including eight years as a member of the Board of Governors. The university said his most recent efforts include shaping Lakehead's future capital campaign and successfully championing the internationalization of the university. Dr. Kotalik is a physician-bioethicist, and chair and founding director of the Centre for Health Care Ethics at Lakehead. According to Lakehead, his experience as a practising oncologist and CEO of Thunder Bay Regional Cancer Centre informed his vision to establish a firm grounding in health-care ethics in local academic and health-care institutions. Convocation ceremonies are scheduled for May 30 and 31.",

        "content": "PARIS (Reuters) - Rafael Nadal exited what could be his last French Open to an outpouring of love and support with a first-round defeat by Alexander Zverev, wishing to be back at Roland Garros for the Paris 2024 Olympics. \"I hope to see you again, but I don't know,\" Nadal told an ecstatic crowd after his straight-sets loss on Monday. \"There's a big percentage I will not be back here but I am not 100% sure. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that motivates me.\" It will the third time since his debut at Roland Garros in 2005, that Nadal, whose body has been martyred by 23 years of professional tennis and who left the tournament with a crushed foot after his record-improving 14th title two years ago, does not get to celebrate his June 3 birthday in Paris. The French, who tend to arrive on court Philippe Chatrier fashionably late on the back of a long lunch, skipped coffee and digestif to fill the arena before the king, racket in hand as usual, stepped onto the court to deafening roars. Spain's Nadal stuck to his routine, avoiding the lines and crossing them with his right foot, sprinting to the baseline during warm-up and positioning his two bottles diagonally aimed at the court. On a rainy day in Paris, organisers closed the roof, adding to the intimacy of the moment. On a court he knows like no one else, Nadal struggled to find his mark early on, netting a routine drop shot and serving a double fault to give Zverev the opening game. The German, who after winning the Rome Masters was the worst possible draw for Nadal, kept his foot on the gas pedal to take the first set even if the Mallorcan showed glimpses of his best with a couple of spinning forehand winners down the line. As soon as Zverev eased the pressure, however, Nadal converted his first break point to take a 3-2 lead in the second set. \"Rafa! Rafa!\" went the crowd, again, as world number ones Iga Swiatek and Novak Djokovic, as well as fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, joined the party. Nadal served for the set but Zverev levelled and forced a tiebreak, which he comfortably won. There was another break for Nadal in the third set, and some 'I-can-still-do-it' fist pumps after a few jaw-dropping winners, but two years after Zverev left their semi-final match on a wheelchair with a broken foot, the German was too good this time. There was a sense of anticipation on the morning of the Nadal v Zverev clash as Swiatek, gunning for a fourth title here, kicked off her campaign with a 6-1 6-2 demolition of French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean. Swiatek has now won her last 15 matches in Paris following her back-to-back wins in 2022 and 2023. Coco Gauff also made a strong start, dispatching German Julia Avdeeva 6-1 6-1 for her 50th Grand Slam match victory. The 20-year-old American, who won the U.S. Open last year to break her Grand Slam duck, is looking to claim her first French Open title after losing the 2022 final in Paris. In the men's draw, Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, seeded second, barely broke sweat as he downed American Chris Eubanks in straight sets, just like former runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas did with Hungarian journeyman Marton Fucsovics.

        "content": "KOCHI: On the 30th, the High Court will again consider the case filed by the former employees of the State Warehousing Corporation demanding their rightful pension. The case is being considered for the 100th time. The petitioners, aged up to 85 years, have been in a legal battle for 23 years. A petition filed in the High Court in 2001, seeking pension payment received a favourable response only when the case was considered in 2010. The corporation approached the Supreme Court against this with a petition but was dismissed in 2017. However, the court order remained unimplemented. At this stage, the pensioners filed a contempt petition in the Supreme Court. The petition was withdrawn after the corporation announced that the court verdict would be implemented immediately, but the pension hike was still not implemented. The pensioners then approached the Supreme Court but the petition was referred to the High Court. The High Court ruled that a minimum of Rs 5,000 and a maximum of Rs 15,500 including dearness allowance till April 1, 2018, should be paid. The court back then also ordered the corporation to complete all dues till then within three months. The High Court will now consider the appeal filed in the Corporation Division Bench and the petition of the pensioners. 45 pensioners died during the legal battle while 603 are still hoping for a favorable result.",

        "content": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Efforts to reduce the availability of alcohol in the state on one side. Measures to increase the number of bars on the other. 801 bars at present. 14 new applications in various districts under scrutiny. 97 bar licenses were issued after the second Pinarayi government came to power. UDF had shut down all but 29 five-star hotels in 2016 before leaving. Four-star bars among the closed bars were allowed to function as per the decision of the left government. 200 new licenses were also granted. By the end of the Left government's term in 2021, the number of bars reached 671. Now there are 801 bars, including those licensed by raising the classification and new ones. High profit business The constant argument of the bar owners is that there is no loss-making business like the bar business. However, even a normal bar has an average daily sales of Rs.1.5 to Rs.2 lakh. Depending on the quality of the bar and the speciality of the location, it can go up to five or six lakhs. 15 to 20 percent of the sale goes to the owner's pocket after all expenses including the share of license fee. Common man's favourite Jawan rum is priced at Rs 640 per litre at Bevco Shop. Jawan rum is sold at bars at peg rate. Rs 65 per peg is the minimum rate. One litre is 16.5 pegs. A litre of Jawan rum is sold for Rs 1072.50. Profit from this is Rs.432. Depending on the quality of the bars, the peg rate can increase and so can the profit. A typical bar sells 750 to 850 pegs of Jawan rum a day. As the price of liquor increases, the peg rate and profit will rise. Burden of donation Owners get amazing profits but donation is a burden. Bar owners have to donate huge sums of money to major political parties during elections. The amount determined will be collected from each bar and handed over by the owners association. Earlier it was up to 25,000, 50,000, now it has become lakhs. Contribution to local leaders is on top of this.",

The government counsel argued that the crime was not serious and that the petitioner might have filed the plea considering the importance of those involved in the case. The counsel also informed the court that several cases have been registered with the Cantonment Police on the grounds of obstruction of official duty and a similar investigation is going on in this case as well. The court dismissed the petition after considering the police report.",

The disciplinary action against Sabu is amid his retirement from the police force on May 31. Thammanam Faizal organized the feast on May 26 at his residence in Puliyanam in Angamaly. Faizal's house and premises were under the surveillance of cops. After receiving intel, Rural Police chief Vaibhav Saxena instruced Angamaly SI to check out the place. The sub inspector reached the place while Sabu was feasting with Faizal. On seeing the official, Sabu hid in a bathroom. Faizal told the SI that the other two cops are his workers. All three were taken to the police station, where it was revealed that the other two with Faizal are cops and they came with the DySP. However, Sabu told the Alappuzha police chief that he was at his residence during this time. On checking the call details of the police officers, it became clear that didn't contact Faizal, who testified that the said DySP didn't come and there was no feast. Jollymon, a driver of Alappuzha Police special branch, and CK Deepak, a CPO, were suspended for visiting the goonda leader's house.",

        "description": "Flashing your lights to let other drivers know of police speed camera vans may seem considerate, but is not looked on kindly by road authorities and can land Brits with a £1,000 fine",
        "content": "Motorists flashing headlights at approaching drivers often means one thing - police camera vans ahead. But doing so risks landing you a hefty rule, due to a little-known rule. The heads up over speed camera vans isn't looked on kindly by police, and is actually considered an offence. A surprising 40% of people were unaware of the rule, while 20% confessed to doing it in the past. Those found guilty could face a nasty £1,000 fine. Virgin Media offers gamers the chance to get £250 but you'll need to act quickly While some drivers might question the harm, the police aims to observe natural road conditions - especially at known speeding hotspots where safety issues may have been flagged. Other frowned-upon behaviours involving flashing headlights include intimidating other drivers, such as when approaching in the outside lane of a motorway, reports Birmingham Live . Rule 110 of the Highway Code explicitly states: \"Only flash your headlights to let other road users know that you are there. Do not flash your headlights to convey any other message or intimidate other road users.\" In areas notorious for parking issues, police are often vigilant as numerous drivers fall foul of this rule. Nick Powell from the AA stressed the significance of being conversant with the Highway Code: \"It's important that every driver is fully aware of the Highway Code, to ensure they keep themselves, and others, safe while on the roads. A lack of understanding from even one driver can impact the safety of every other vehicle, cyclist, and pedestrian they share the road with, as well as the people or pets they might have in their car.\" He also recommended motorists to regularly brush up on their knowledge of traffic laws: \"Motorists should take the time to refresh their knowledge of traffic rules and regulations, no matter how long they're been driving, and should also avoid any common mistakes, such as speeding or swearing at other motorists. \"Drivers are accountable for the safety of all their passengers too, so they need to ensure they don't overfill the vehicle, that any pets are secured, and that every single person is wearing a seatbelt.\"",

        "content": "Home | Editorials | Editorial Growing Isolation Of Israel Editorial: Growing isolation of Israel The move by Spain, Norway and Ireland signals a significant shift in Europe against Israel’s excesses in Gaza By Telangana Today Published Date - 27 May 2024, 11:45 PM Benjamin Netanyahu The decision by Spain, Norway and Ireland to recognise an independent Palestinian state is yet another testimony to the strengthening international opinion in favour of a permanent two-state solution to the vexed conflict. The move also reflects increasing public outrage over an unjust war being carried out by Israel on Gaza leading to massive devastation and civilian death toll. With over 140 countries in the world, including India, coming out in support of the Palestinian cause, Israel is facing international isolation at a level never seen in the past for its military offensive that violates all norms. This is reminiscent of the isolation that South Africa’s apartheid regime faced in the 1980s. One hopes that the latest assertion by the Western European nations would bolster the Palestinian cause and provide a fillip to the efforts towards a two-state solution, where both Israel and Palestine can peacefully co-exist together. The far-right regime in Tel Aviv has been expanding settlements in the occupied West Bank and is continuing to bombard Gaza without either toppling Hamas or bringing home all its hostages. The closely coordinated announcements by Spain, Norway and Ireland, signal a significant shift in Europe against Israel’s excesses in Gaza, widely condemned as genocidal. Notably, Norway, a key player in the Oslo Accords of 1993, has emphasised that recognising Palestine is crucial for peace in West Asia, asserting that a two-state solution is in Israel’s best interest. Ireland and Spain have echoed this sentiment, underscoring the need to break the cycle of violence that has worsened since the October 7 attack by Hamas and the subsequent Israeli counter-assaults. The latest recognition is an act of powerful political and symbolic value and comes close on the heels of the International Criminal Court issuing arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and three Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes. With the International Court of Justice hearing South Africa’s appeal to stop Israel’s attacks in Rafah, the global clamour for accountability and justice is growing. Hopefully, these developments will inspire other Western countries to follow suit and step up international pressure for a permanent ceasefire and meaningful negotiations to find a lasting solution. The growing support for a Palestinian state among European nations is a huge straw in the wind that will grow into a hurricane if Israel does not change course. Tel Aviv, on the other hand, contends that the establishment of a Palestinian state would pose an existential threat to Israel. On its part, India has been maintaining a consistent policy, advocating for direct negotiations to establish a sovereign, independent Palestine coexisting peacefully with Israel. It has reiterated its long-standing support for a two-state solution, though Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s tweet condemning the initial Hamas attack was interpreted by some observers as a shift in the country’s stance.

Puskar) ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list on Monday after the reigning NL MVP sustained a season-ending torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. Acuña was hurt in the Braves' 8-1 win at Pittsburgh on Sunday. After opening the game with a double, Acuña started toward third on a stolen base attempt. His left knee gave way when he stopped in an attempt to return to second base. Atlanta announced Sunday night an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require surgery. Acuña tore his right ACL on July 20, 2021 . He returned on April 28, 2022, after missing Atlanta's first 19 games of the season. Atlanta has lost two top players to season-ending injuries in the first two months of the season. All-Star right-hander Spencer Strider's season ended on April 13 when he had internal brace surgery to repair the ulnar collateral ligament in his pitching elbow. Acuña's injury came just as the Braves were looking forward to having two starters return to their lineup. Third baseman Austin Riley and catcher Sean Murphy started in Monday's game against Washington. Riley missed two weeks with tightness in his left side and Murphy had been out with a strained left oblique since March 30. “There are few players in this league that are on a level he is,” Riley said. “It's a joy to watch him every night and to have that happen, you feel for him.” Riley said he and other key players “are going to have to step up and pull our full weight. He'll be missed for sure.” The Braves have won six straight NL East titles and won the 2021 World Series as Acuña was rehabbing from his first season-ending injury. The Braves entered Monday's games in second place in the division, six games behind Philadelphia. “We have more than 100 games left and we're 10 games over .500,” Murphy said. “We're still in a great spot. I don't think there's any reason to be worried about the Atlanta Braves.” Even so, Murphy added “I don't think there's anyone else in the big leagues who could just step in and do what Ronald does.” Manager Brian Snitker chose second baseman Ozzie Albies as the team's new leadoff hitter. Jared Kelenic and Adam Duvall, who have been sharing time in left field, each started against the Nationals. Duvall replaced Acuña in right field and Kelenic started in left field. “You hate it,” said Snitker of Acuña's injury. “It's part of it. You try to look at it that now we're going to give somebody a chance to do something special in his absence. ... Jared is going to get some regular at-bats. I think he's ready to take that next step.” Snitker said “I feel worse for the kid than for us that he has to go through this again.” Acuña was voted the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases, becoming the first player to have at least 40 homers and 70 steals in a season. The 26-year-old from Venezuela was hitting .250 with four homers, 15 RBIs and 16 steals this season. The Braves recalled outfielder J.P. Martinez from Triple-A Gwinnett and infielder Joey Wendle was designated for assignment. Martinez will be the fourth outfielder. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb Charles Odum, The Associated Press See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

The 39-year-old star joined the Saudi club in January 2023, after signing a contract for two-and-a-half years. As the Saudi Pro League comes to its end, with Al Hilal winning the title, Cristiano Ronaldo is set to become the top scorer of this season with 33 goals on his name. This recognition is expected to be formally given at the end of Al Nassr's game with Al Ittehad at King Abdullah Sports City. Cristiano Ronaldo is not only finishing this season with Saudi Arabia but the forward holds the record for the highest number of goals in the UEFA Champions League. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner is in high spirits to complete the number of 900 goals as he was just 9 nets away from writing his name into the books of football history as the best player. His total tally is 891. He is also at the top of the list of the best international football players ahead of Pele, Lionel Messi and many more with 128 strikes under his name.",

        "content": "The Attorney-General of Federation ( AGF) and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi, SAN has called for crucial reforms and enhanced cooperation within the judiciary across West African nations. The AGF made the call at the opening ceremony of the Statutory Meeting of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in Abuja, which had judicial leaders from the sub-region. Fagbemi commended the Chief Justices and judicial representatives from various ECOWAS member states for their vital roles in the administration of justice. He noted the shared challenges faced by national courts, including issues of judicial autonomy, funding, and infrastructure, and urged the council to use this regional platform to address these concerns collectively. “The challenges confronting the judiciary or the justice system in general across the States are identical,” Fagbemi noted. “I therefore humbly enjoin your Lordships to utilize this regional platform, as an avenue for peer review and cross-fertilization of ideas, to achieve greater independence of the judiciary, a more prosperous and safer sub-region.” Fagbemi also advocated for a reform-oriented review of the practice and procedure of the ECOWAS Court of Justice to mitigate conflicts with national courts and enhance the court’s effectiveness as a regional judicial body. The Attorney-General emphasized the judiciary’s role in promoting the rule of law and democratic governance, especially in light of recent pressures on these principles. He called on the judiciary to help prevent military incursions into governance by ensuring adherence to free and fair elections and constitutional governance. “As the ECOWAS block continues to work towards achieving uniform economic policies and institutions, the judiciary should not be left behind,” Fagbemi said. He proposed that the ECOWAS Judicial Council foster a credible network for promoting uniform rules of practice and procedure, thus reducing legal conflicts across the region. Notable judicial figures at the opening ceremony included the Chief Justices of Nigeria, Olukayode Ariwoola, and that of Cabo Verde, Cote d’Ivoire, Benin, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, as well as representatives from Senegal and Togo, and the President of the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice. The meeting is aimed at enhancing judicial collaboration in addressing regional challenges and promoting the rule of law, economic integration, and democratic governance in West Africa.

        "content": "KUWAIT: The Kuwait Society for Smoking and Cancer Prevention (KSSCP) announced the opening of an anti-smoking clinic at the Life Science College of Sabah Al-Salem University City on the occasion of World No Smoking Day. KSSCP board member and treasurer, Dr Hussa Majid Al-Shaheen, in her opening speech, lauded the efforts of the university in completing the clinic. Dr Al-Shaheen spoke about the dangerous harms smoking (of all types) causes, be they physical or psychological, in addition to the social harms. She said the clinic has been successful in assisting smokers and those who want to quit smoking. “The clinic creates an opportunity for those who wish to stop this harmful habit, as youths are the target of the tobacco mafia around the world. The fierce marketing campaign to promote smoking among the young generations through the launch of e-smoking devices and promoting them as means to stop smoking calls for concern because the opposite is true and they are not good for the body,” she added. University Deputy Rector for Planning Asaad Al-Rashid said the opening of the first specialized clinic is the first initiative of this kind at Kuwait University. He appreciated the efforts of all concerned parties to open the clinic on the university campus. This will create awareness about the dangers of smoking. Head of the Health Cities at the Ministry of Health, Dr Amal Al-Yahya, said the opening will prevent smoking in the university city, adding that Sabah Al-Salem University City was approved as a healthy university. Meanwhile, Chairman of the Board of KSSCP, Dr Khalid Al-Saleh, said that treatment of addiction is among the most important strategies of smoking control programs. “Many smokers find it difficult to stop by themselves. They will benefit from the services that are available at the smoking prevention clinics. The goal is to help smokers who wish to stop, create awareness about the dangers of smoking, and dispense medicines that help stop smoking,” he explained.",

        "content": "The devastating losses for wine and some fruit producers in the Okanagan in the past few years has some growers shifting their focus and looking to diversify. At operations like Paynter’s Fruit Market in West Kelowna, Gatzke’s Orchards in Lake Country and McMillan Farms in Kelowna they are banking on vegetables, flowers and other ground crops. “We’re planting so many more musk melons, cantaloupe and watermelons this year, because of the loss of the peaches,” Paynter’s owner/operator Jennay Oliver told Castanet after extreme cold in January wiped out her peaches and apricots. Alan Gatzke said his peach, apricot and cherry crops were also significantly damaged, but because he has a diversified farm, it’s easier to plant more vegetables and other ground crops. Ron McMillan has decided to put in more sunflowers, to supplement his usual crop of pumpkins that has been impacted by heat and cold in recent years. He also considered adding hops to his fields, but couldn't find a reliable buyer. He says climate change has been top of mind for growers in the Okanagan for quite some time. “I think this is a wake-up for people who are non-farmers. I think the farmers have been realizing something has been going on for a while, have been sounding the alarm, but not everybody’s been listening,” McMillan said. Gatzke adds that there’s no doubt in his mind that the weather has been more volatile in the last decade, pointing to the 2021 heat dome and temperatures below -25 over the past two winters. McMillan says growers will have to adapt to the increasingly severe weather events. “One thing you’re going to see is there’s going to be a lot of changes going on as people try to find ways to make this work. “It’s here and we have to adapt and keep trying to do things to keep ahead of it,” he adds. For those who put all their eggs in one basket, finding a new source of revenue will be tougher. The BC Ministry of Agriculture and Food says it’s common practice for producers to diversify to mitigate losses, but ground crops also face challenges developing a sales model and end market for their products. The ministry suggests looking at direct to consumer sales through farmers markets, restaurants and local retailers. Producers looking for information about Ministry support or accessing programs should contact our AgriService BC at 1-888-221-7141 or . Vineyards and fruit growers in BC can tap into a this year to help them grow hardier, climate resistant varieties. It’s anticipated approximately 1,000 producers will access the fund. The ministry is also working with industry associations to develop planting guidelines that position the province to adapt and perform will in the face of the changing climate, pest, disease and market pressures.",

        "content": "The Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru visited the Cocoland Sugar Development Project in Abau, Central province on Sunday. He was received by the chairman of the Yaosoeng Sugar and Cane Consultant Company, Prapat Jenlapwattanakul and his team, the landowners, community leaders, and the people of Cocolands. Mr Maru described his visit as ‘‘a very useful visit’’. After visiting the project site, Mr Maru said: “I do appreciate that there is enough grassland for the project, there is enough State land to build the sugar mill, and the local people are very supportive of this project.” Mr Maru explained the processes that will now follow which include putting together a NEC Submission before the cabinet for endorsement. ‘‘The Cabinet will basically approve that the Government must support this project and it will be developed as an SEZ meaning the company will be given incentives to invest here including tax holiday and duty-free exemptions. ‘‘This is subject to phase two which is negotiations between the company, the landowners, the DDA, the LLGs, the local MP, the Provincial Government, and the State, to agree to the elements of the project like benefits for landowners, new wharf, power supply, etc which will be captured in the project agreement. The project agreement will be signed and subject to the negotiations. ‘‘After the signing of the project agreement, the State will give the land title to the company. ‘‘The company will need the title to have security of land tenure so they can go to the banks to raise capital to build the sugar mill and to start this project. ‘‘The shareholders of this project the State through Kumul Consolidated Holdings, the provincial government, and other investors,” Mr Maru explained. The proposal is for a 40, 000-hectare sugar farm, a processing mill, and a power plant. This follows a successful trial in Abau on the proposed sugar farm land. The plantation will produce 3 million tonnes of sugar every year with the target market to be PNG and other countries, especially Indonesia.",

        "content": "An old letter of recommendation written by Vadgaon Sheri MLA Sunil Tingre, recommending Dr Ajay Taware for the post of Medical Superintendent, Sassoon Hospital, has come back to haunt the MLA as police arrested Dr Taware for his role in allegedly throwing away the blood sample of the juvenile involved in the Porsche crash. The letter was written by Tingre on December 26, 2023 to the Minister for Medical Education and Research Hassan Mushriff and Dr Taware was appointed as the Medical Superintendent in the same year. In his letter, Tingre recommended Dr Taware as personally known to him . “During the Covid-19 crisis he had done commendable work. I request you to take proper steps at your level to appoint him as the Medical Superintendent,” the letter read. Back then, Dr Taware was working as the Head and Professor of the Department of Forensic Science, post which he became the Medical Superintendent. Advertisement Dr Taware was removed twice from his post of Medical Superintendent, once for his alleged role in the kidney transplant racket involving the Ruby Hall Clinic in 2022 and another time in April this year due to the rat bite incident in the hospital. The letter had surfaced when the police had busted the major drug cartel involving Lalit Patil which was allegedly being run from the Sassoon Hospital. Back then, Tingre had said as public representative many people ask for recommendations and he had issued the same. Following the recent incident, the letter has resurfaced again. Mushriff was unable for comment despite repeated calls to him as he was busy in a party meeting in Mumbai . On Monday, Dr Taware and Dr Srihari Harnol were arrested by police for allegedly tampering with the blood sample of the juvenile who was driving the speeding Porsche which killed two software engineers. Police had claimed the blood sample of the juvenile was thrown away in the dustbin and replaced by someone else’s blood sample. The matter came to light when DNA from both the samples did not match.

        "content": "CALGARY — Steve Blake has a powerful message — don’t give up on your dreams no matter what life throws your way. The Calgary golf professional is gearing up for playing in Canada’s lone PGA Tour Champions event of the season while battling inoperable Stage 4 lung cancer. “You may be handed a death sentence, but it doesn’t mean life’s over,” said Blake, whose received the shocking diagnosis in September. “You’ve still got a lot to give, so get out there and give something.” Blake was given a sponsor exemption on Monday, his 56th birthday, to play in his hometown at the 2024 Rogers Charity Classic at Canyon Meadows Golf and Country Club from Aug. 16 to 18. “The more I have something like this tournament coming up to look forward to, the more alive I feel,” Blake said. “I don’t feel like I’m sick. I feel like I’m just this normal guy who’s going to practise for this tournament coming up and hopefully I’ll be around for the next one and so on and so on. “As devastating as something can sound, I think if you believe that you can conquer something, you will, especially if you have good support staff and family (and) friends.” Blake, who also competed at the PGA Tour Champions event in 2018 when the tournament was known as the Shaw Charity Classic, decided to apply for another exemption while in the midst of undergoing eight months of chemotherapy treatments. He is looking forward to playing the sport he loves, possibly alongside fellow Canadians Mike Weir and Stephen Ames. “It’s incredible,” Blake said. “The opportunity, it leaves you speechless obviously to compete again with these guys to be on the same stage. The situation being what it is, they were very open to receive my letter and have me in there.” A non-smoker with an active lifestyle, Blake developed a nagging cough in August. “I made a deal with my wife that if it did get worse that I would go to the hospital,” said Blake. “Long story short, about 16 hours later and my wife had shown up by that time, sitting in emergency going through a bunch of tests and stuff and they came back with the diagnosis.” Blake faced his prognosis from his oncologist with his family by his side. “We knew it wasn’t going to be good,” Blake said. “He said 12 to 24 months, but I kind of really grabbed onto that and said, ‘I just want this to be the starting point. Like, I’ll see you in 24 months and then we’ll discuss another prognosis if you’ve got another one for me.’ “Being able to look forward to something like this does so much for me mentally, physically, everything, just to get me psyched up to come out here and compete again.” The devastating news was a shock to the system for Blake, his wife Kelly and their kids Connor, 25, and Brooklyn, 22, who are both accomplished athletes. “When we told the kids, they were so emotional as well,” said Kelly. “We didn’t know if Steve would be well enough to golf, let alone out here (at Canyon Meadows).” Connor is a defenceman playing hockey for the ECHL’s Adirondack Thunder, while Brooklyn is a midfielder with Calgary Foothills WFC. “I’m always looking for something to take my mind off the illness,” said Blake, who works as a financial adviser. “I’m still trying to be very active in work. I’m still trying to be very active in golf and in my kids’ sports and things like that.” After just missing out on qualifying to compete at the U.S. Senior Open Championship last year, Blake will attempt to earn a spot to play at this year’s tournament to be held at Newport Country Club in Newport, R.I., from June 27 to 30. “Having something like the U.S. Senior Open qualifier to look forward to again, just the idea of being able to go down and compete, is something that’s really special to me and my wife,” said Blake, who will tee it up for a qualifying round at Goose Creek Golf Club in Jurupa Valley, Calif., on Tuesday. “I’m fortunate I’ve played (Goose Creek) a couple times. I was close the last time I was down there. Hopefully, I just make a few more putts and we’ll see if we can get in the U.S. Senior Open again.” Blake played at the major in 2018 at the Broadmoor Golf Club in Colorado Springs, Col. Although he missed the cut with rounds of 79 and 74, it gave him confidence that he could hold his own against the likes of World Golf Hall of Fame members Vijay Singh and Bernhard Langer. “It’s just such a great opportunity to come out and compete with them,” said Blake, who carded rounds of 70, 77 and 71 six years ago at Canyon Meadows to finish well back of winner Scott McCarron. “It’ll be a little different than the last time. It’ll be similar as far as having family and friends and the crowd around, which I so enjoy having. “I know in 2018, it was let’s just not embarrass myself while I’m out here too much. It will be different, just playing for something maybe just a little bit bigger than me. I hope people see the message and see that somebody with an illness like this can still get out there and still pursue their dreams.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.

As rumours intensified about the villain of the movie, producer Chithra Laksmanan has said that South star Sathyaraj will play the villain in Sikandar. Laksmanan in an interview said that Sathyaraj, who played the role of Kattappa in Baahubali, will be up as villain against Khan in Sikandar.

        "description": "The full music video is expected to drop June 7",
        "content": "Ariana Grande debuted an unsettling teaser Monday for “The Boy is Mine,” the eighth track on her latest album Eternal Sunshine . In the 10-second clip posted to Instagram, a man turns on a faucet and plunges his face in the sink, as a grisly hand with opaque claws pries open the door. The full music video, expected to be released on June 7, comes after music videos for “We Can’t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)” and hit track “Yes, And?” came out earlier this year. All three tracks are off her seventh album, which released March 8. The “We Can’t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)” video, which came out on the album-release day, draws references to the 2004 film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , as Grande’s character begins a procedure that erases all memories of her ex. However, “The Boy is Mine” teaser has darker undertones. A post shared by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) “The Boy is Mine,” which fed online rumors around her relationship with Ethan Slater (former lead in the Broadway musical Spongebob Squarepant s), has an R&B-pop sound and shares the same name with the 1998 Brandy and Monica track. In a March interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music, Grande said she “always wanted to reimagine” the 1998 track that topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 13 weeks. In a Rolling Stone review , Grande’s Eternal Sunshine album was described as “a gorgeously exposed journey to the end of her world — or at least what she believes to be the end. It’s a divorce album that goes through all the stages of grief, and the singer navigates a new beginning with some of the most honest and inventive songs of her career so far.” On the horizon, Grande will star in the novel-turned-musical-turned- film adaptation of Wicked as Glinda, Good Witch of the East, alongside Cynthia Erivo as the Wicked Witch of the West, set to release Nov. 27.",

        "description": "More than half of the state’s perfect scorers have come from the Latur division",
        "content": "The dominance of the Latur pattern was evident again in this year's , as it registered the highest number of students in the state scoring 100 per cent marks. This year, the Latur division produced 123 students who scored cent percent marks in the SSC board examination, which is more than half of the total 187 students across the state who achieved a perfect score. This success did not happen suddenly or by chance. For over two decades, teachers and educational institutes in the Marathwada region have worked hard and evolved a system—popularly called the ‘Latur Pattern’—which has helped hundreds and thousands of students crack competitive exams like NEET and IIT-JEE and get good grades in class X and XII board exams. ADVERTISEMENT Despite the Latur division securing a seventh position among the nine divisional boards in Maharashtra with respect to overall pass percentage, its overall pass percentage this year is 95.27 per cent. However, known as a \"topper factory\" in academic circles, the Latur division lived up to its nickname even this year. Building on the much-talked-about ‘Latur pattern,’ schools across the district have managed to secure a strong presence in the elite ‘100 per cent club,’ year after year, a phenomenon that has been especially evident in the state board results post-2016 after the state education department introduced bonus marks for art and culture for the Class X exams. The state board awards extra marks to students for their remarkable achievements in the fields of art and sports in the SSC board exams. For the past few years, the state board has been declaring results based on the best of five subjects. This year, a total of 187 students achieved a perfect 100 per cent score. Division-wise, Latur had the highest number with 123 students, followed by with 32, and Pune with 10. Mumbai had eight students, Amravati had seven, while Kolhapur and Konkan each had three. Nagpur had one student, and Nashik had none. Last year, of the 151 students with 100 percent, 109 were from Latur, while six were from Mumbai. In 2022, 70 students from Latur scored 100 percent among the 122 from across the state. Of these, Pune had five and Mumbai had one student who scored 100 per cent that year. In 2020, of the 242 students who scored a perfect 100 across the nine divisions in the state, 151 were from the Latur division. In 2018, 125 students scored 100 percent marks, of which 68 were from Latur alone. The Latur pattern of study is a model that gained prominence during the 1980s as an initiative by a group of dedicated academics in the district, who aimed to enhance the quality of education in the region. After the district was established in 1982, schools and colleges began actively training students with parental support to improve learning outcomes. “It is an old model started by a group of educationists and passed on to the new generation, followed to date. The term ‘Latur pattern,’ however, was coined when the then education minister Vilasrao Deshmukh used it while felicitating meritorious students at an event during that time,\" said a teacher from a Zilla Parishad school in Latur. An official from the state board said, \"The Latur pattern has been successful for years. While it has produced many high-scoring students, we are now focusing on improving outcomes for all students. Over the years, the overall pass percentage in the division has been declining, and we are actively working to reverse this trend.\"",

        "content": "Best News Website or Mobile Service WAN-IFRA Digital Media Awards Worldwide 2022 Best News Website or Mobile Service Digital Media Awards Worldwide 2022 PARIS : Rafael Nadal exited what could be his last French Open to an outpouring of love and support with a first-round defeat by Alexander Zverev, wishing to be back at Roland Garros for the Paris 2024 Olympics. \"I hope to see you again, but I don't know,\" Nadal told an ecstatic crowd after his straight-sets loss on Monday. \"There's a big percentage I will not be back here but I am not 100 per cent sure. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that motivates me.\" It will the third time since his debut at Roland Garros in 2005, that Nadal, whose body has been martyred by 23 years of professional tennis and who left the tournament with a crushed foot after his record-improving 14th title two years ago, does not get to celebrate his June 3 birthday in Paris. The French, who tend to arrive on court Philippe Chatrier fashionably late on the back of a long lunch, skipped coffee and digestif to fill the arena before the king, racket in hand as usual, stepped onto the court to deafening roars. Spain's Nadal stuck to his routine, avoiding the lines and crossing them with his right foot, sprinting to the baseline during warm-up and positioning his two bottles diagonally aimed at the court. On a rainy day in Paris, organisers closed the roof, adding to the intimacy of the moment. On a court he knows like no one else, Nadal struggled to find his mark early on, netting a routine drop shot and serving a double fault to give Zverev the opening game. The German, who after winning the Rome Masters was the worst possible draw for Nadal, kept his foot on the gas pedal to take the first set even if the Mallorcan showed glimpses of his best with a couple of spinning forehand winners down the line. As soon as Zverev eased the pressure, however, Nadal converted his first break point to take a 3-2 lead in the second set. \"Rafa! Rafa!\" went the crowd, again, as world number ones Iga Swiatek and Novak Djokovic, as well as fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, joined the party. Nadal served for the set but Zverev levelled and forced a tiebreak, which he comfortably won. There was another break for Nadal in the third set, and some 'I-can-still-do-it' fist pumps after a few jaw-dropping winners, but two years after Zverev left their semi-final match on a wheelchair with a broken foot, the German was too good this time. There was a sense of anticipation on the morning of the Nadal v Zverev clash as Swiatek, gunning for a fourth title here, kicked off her campaign with a 6-1 6-2 demolition of French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean. Swiatek has now won her last 15 matches in Paris following her back-to-back wins in 2022 and 2023. Coco Gauff also made a strong start, dispatching German Julia Avdeeva 6-1 6-1 for her 50th Grand Slam match victory. The 20-year-old American, who won the U.S. Open last year to break her Grand Slam duck, is looking to claim her first French Open title after losing the 2022 final in Paris. In the men's draw, Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, seeded second, barely broke sweat as he downed American Chris Eubanks in straight sets, just like former runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas did with Hungarian journeyman Marton Fucsovics.",

Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people, about half of Gaza's population, displaced from other parts of the territory. On Sunday Hamas launched a barrage of rockets from Gaza towards heavily populated central Israel , setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The US National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images\" from the strike on Rafah \"are heartbreaking.\" It said the US was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. \"There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians.

        "content": "ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. It recently released a 8,000 word exposé on how 3M knew that its PFAS chemicals were in people’s bodies. The information in the article is too important to overlook, so here are its highlights. In 1997, Jim Johnson gave a 3M Corporation chemist, Kris Hansen, an unusual assignment: Hansen was to test human blood for chemical contamination. With a doctoral dissertation on tiny particles in the atmosphere, she was the right choice. What was the reason for Hansen’s assignment? Several of 3M’s most successful products contained human-made compounds called fluorochemicals. The company’s PFOS (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) had tested positive in the bodies of 3M factory workers. General population samples, too, seemed to contain the blood contaminants. Were these results a lab error? She used a mass spectrometer, which weighs molecules and makes identification possible. She and her team devoted several weeks analyzing more blood — every single one was contaminated. She updated Johnson on her team’s findings. His response was “cryptic.” Without any feedback from her supervisors, she and her team ordered fresh blood samples from every supplier with whom 3M worked. Each of the samples tested positive for PFOS. Then her boss took early retirement. Although Hansen had been told that PFOS wasn’t harmful in factory workers, she wanted to be certain. She knew from her studies and previous field research that the most reliable way to gauge the safety of chemicals is to study them over time, in animals and, if possible, in humans. What Hansen didn’t know was that 3M had already conducted animal studies, starting in the 1970s. The studies had shown PFOS to be toxic, yet the results remained secret, even to many at the company. Rats and monkeys died within weeks of PFOS exposure. In 1979, an internal company report deemed PFOS “certainly more toxic than anticipated” and recommended longer term studies. Hansen’s bosses never told her that PFOS was toxic. Meanwhile, one superior intimated that her lab testing equipment might be contaminated. After careful cleaning, the results stayed the same. 3M bought three additional and very expensive mass spectrometers, and she repeated her tests on different populations and in different venues. Each sample contained PFOS. The chemical seemed to be everywhere. On its website today, 3M describes fluorochemicals. “3M helped pioneer the science of fluorochemistry more than 60 years ago – and we’re continuing to find new ways to put these amazing materials to work ... 3M fluorochemicals are engineered for high purity, performance and sustainability – including our next-generation C4 chemistry, offering a favorable safety and environmental profile for its intended uses.” These compounds are now considered “forever chemicals.” In 2023 the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) released the first tranche of testing data for PFAS in drinking water. They found hundreds of water systems are contaminated with the toxic “forever chemicals.” About 8% of water systems that serve approximately 14 million people detected two of the most common of these chemicals, PFOA and PFOS, in their drinking water at levels that exceed EPA’s proposed drinking water limits. A colleague gave Hansen more blood samples to test, which were positive for PFOS — yet the samples came from a horse. Instead of succumbing to humiliation, Hansen questioned why PFOS was making its way into animals. Her answer was unnerving: the chemical had spread through the food chain and perhaps through water. Hansen and her team ultimately found PFOS in eagles, chickens, rabbits, cows, pigs, and other animals. They also found 14 additional fluorochemicals in human blood, including several produced by 3M. Some were present in wastewater from a 3M factory. Hansen found no recourse for the way senior colleagues kept questioning her work. Instead, she devised an experiment in which blood without PFOS might be located. She was successful — samples that showed no trace of PFOS were located in blood that had been collected before 3M created PFOS. “Apparently, fluorochemicals had entered human blood after the company started selling products that contained them,” the ProPublica article explains. “They had leached out of 3M’s sprays, coatings, and factories — and into all of us.” Hansen met a scientist who revealed to her a paper written in 1981 by 3M scientists. It outlined experiments and confirmed suspicions about 3M origins of PFOS, but 3M lawyers had urged the lab not to reveal their findings. A presentation Hansen was asked to give to 3M’s CEO, Livio D. DeSimone, “seemed to view her diligence as a betrayal: Her data could be damaging to the company.” The CEO fell asleep in the meeting. While defending herself, she recalled other scientists before her who had been unsuccessful in persuading the upper 3M echelon. Soon afterward, Hansen’s job description changed. Only experiments specifically requested by a supervisor would be permitted. Her new role would be to analyze samples for studies that other employees were conducting — and to do so without question. Yet Hansen’s research was not lost. The results of her research “were quietly making their way into the files of the Environmental Protection Agency.” By 1998, 3M officials admitted that the company had measured PFOS in blood samples from around the US — Hansen’s research — but did not believe that its products presented a substantial risk to human health. Hansen, meanwhile, was ostracized by her superiors and co-workers. Over 2 decades Hansen worked on many new tasks at 3M — except fluorochemicals. Pressure from the EPA forced 3M to discontinue its entire portfolio of PFOS-­related chemicals. In 2006, after the EPA accused 3M of violating the Toxic Substances Control Act, in part by repeatedly ­failing to disclose the harms of fluorochemicals promptly, the company agreed to pay a small penalty of $1.5 million, without admitting wrongdoing. A swath of 150 square miles around 3M’s headquarters was found to be polluted with PFAS — local fish and water supplies were full of it. In October 2022, after Hansen had been at 3M for 26 years, her job was eliminated, and she chose not to apply for a new one. She reached out to ProPublica for what would be her first public discussion of her fluorochemicals research. She expressed regret that revealing what she had known earlier in her life “would have been too much to bear at the time.” Johnson, Hansen’s former boss, not only concurred with her accounts but added multi-layered details of his own attempts to uncover flurochemicals in 3M products and their reaction in humans. 3M has now settled a lawsuit filed by cities and towns with polluted water to the tune of $12.5 billion to filter out PFAS — depending on how many water systems need the chemicals removed. “The settlement, however, doesn’t approach the scale of the problem,” the ProPublica article concludes. “At least 45% of US tap water is estimated to contain one or more forever chemicals.” The cost of removing them all will likely reach $100 billion. An April 2024 Biden-Harris rule will designate the PFAS chemicals as hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as Superfund, and “will help ensure that polluters pay to clean up their contamination.” The original story in its entirety is exempt from ProPublica’s Creative Commons license until July 19.

        "content": "Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory used additive manufacturing to produce the first defect-free complex tungsten parts for use in extreme environments. The accomplishment could have positive implications for clean-energy technologies such as fusion energy. Tungsten has the highest melting point of any metal, making it ideal for fusion reactors where plasma temperatures exceed 180 million degrees Fahrenheit. In comparison, the sun’s center is about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit. In its pure form, tungsten is brittle at room temperature and easily shatters. To counter this, ORNL researchers developed an electron-beam 3D-printer to deposit tungsten, layer by layer, into precise three-dimensional shapes. This technology uses a magnetically directed stream of particles in a high-vacuum enclosure to melt and bind metal powder into a solid-metal object. The vacuum environment reduces foreign material contamination and residual stress formation. “Electron-beam additive manufacturing is promising for the processing of complex tungsten geometries,” said ORNL ’s Michael Kirka . “This is an important step for expanding the use of temperature-resistant metals in energy resources that will support a sustainable, carbon-free future.” Image and article courtesy of ORNL , U.S. Department of Energy.

        "content": "SPRINGFIELD – The Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation is a step closer to acquiring a 1,500-acre state park in , much of which was once part of a reservation that was illegally seized from the tribe in the mid-19 th century. As the Senate worked through its last stack of bills Sunday before planning to adjourn for the summer, it voted 49-7 to pass Bill 867, which authorizes deeding the property to the tribe for $1. “Rarely do we get to make amends for the sins of our collective past,” state Sen. Mark Walker, D-Arlington Heights, the bill’s chief sponsor, said on the Senate floor. “As you might expect, this bill is to repair the 150 years we have suffered with a moral wound.” The Prairie Band Potawatomi were originally granted a reservation of about two square miles – about 1,280 acres – in the 1829 Treaty of Prairie du Chien. But around 1849, Chief Shab-eh-nay traveled west to northeast Kansas, where many other members of the tribe had relocated. While he was gone, the federal government declared the reservation land abandoned and sold it at public auction. In the 1970s, the state of Illinois used federal grant funds to buy about 1,500 acres that now make up Lake and State Park. That land partially overlaps the original reservation. Other parts of the original reservation consist of county-owned property and about 30 private homes. The bill represents one part of the Prairie Band Potawatomi’s long-running effort to reestablish its presence in Illinois. The tribe also recently acquired 130 acres in the area, and last month the U.S. Department of the Interior formally placed that land in trust, making it the only federally recognized tribal reservation in Illinois. Acquisition of the 1,500 acres of park land would greatly expand the Potawatomi’s footprint in the area. But that has made some residents who live nearby nervous about the future of the community, especially if the tribe decides to develop a casino or make other major changes to the park area. The issue has also made some state lawmakers nervous, especially those unaccustomed to working with issues involving tribal relations. “This just came up and we’re receiving a lot of opposition, and this is unique to our state,” Republican state Sen. Sue Rezin, of Morris, who represents a neighboring district, said during a committee hearing Saturday. Tribal officials have said they have no plans to develop a casino in the area, noting that a casino already exists in downtown Aurora, only about 45 minutes to the east. State Sen. Win Stoller, R-East Peoria, whose district includes the park land, said he believes residents of the area have nothing to fear from the land transfer. “The Prairie Band have committed to keeping the park open to the public and even have plans to improve the infrastructure and experiences available in the park,” he said on the Senate floor. “Local officials including the mayor of Shabbona are in support. I believe this is the right thing to do.” The bill next moves to the House, which is scheduled to reconvene Tuesday to wrap up its business for the spring session.",

        "content": "Geneva: The World Health Organization chief on Monday urged countries to nail down a landmark global agreement on handling of future pandemics after they missed a hard deadline. Scarred by Covid-19 -- which killed millions, shredded economies and crippled health systems -- nations have spent two years trying to forge binding commitments on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response. Negotiators failed to clinch a deal ahead of this week's World Health Assembly -- the annual gathering of WHO's 194 member states -- the deadline for concluding the talks. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus opened the assembly Monday, saying he was confident that an agreement would be secured. \"Of course, we all wish that we had been able to reach a consensus on the agreement in time for this health assembly and crossed the finish line,\" he said. \"But I remain confident that you still will, because where there is a will, there is a way.\" Tedros said the task before negotiators had been \"immense, technically, legally, and politically\", and that they had been \"operating on a very ambitious time line\". \"You have demonstrated a clear commitment to reaching an agreement,\" he said, adding that negotiators had \"worked long days and nights\", closing meetings as late as 4:00 am. He hailed their dedication to push forward despite \"a torrent of misinformation that was undermining your negotiations\". While missing Friday's deadline, countries have voiced a commitment to keep pushing for an accord. Negotiators are due on Tuesday to present the outcome of the talks to the assembly, which runs until June 1, and the assembly will take stock and decide what to do next. \"I know that there remains among you a common will to get this done, so, there must always be a way,\" Tedros said. \"Meaning the solution is in your hands,\" he stressed. Parallel talks have also taken place on revising the International Health Regulations, which were first adopted in 1969 and constitute the existing international legally binding framework for responding to public health emergencies around the world. The proposed amendments to the IHR, including adding more nuance to a system meant to alert countries to potential health emergencies of global concern, might have a better chance of being adopted during this week's assembly, observers said.",

That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ‘Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. — By TIM REYNOLDS, AP Basketball Writer",

        "content": "NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma issued a notice to Punjab DGP Gaurav Yadav following accusations by BJP leader Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga. Bagga alleged that Balkar Singh, an AAP MLA, engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct during a video call with a woman seeking employment. New Delhi: The National Commission for Women (NCW) has called for a swift investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct against Punjab minister Balkar Singh. The NCW has requested a report from the state police within three days. NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma issued a notice to Punjab DGP Gaurav Yadav following accusations by BJP leader Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga. Bagga alleged that Balkar Singh, an AAP MLA, engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct during a video call with a woman seeking employment. Sharma condemned the incident as an affront to the dignity of the woman involved and urged immediate personal intervention by the Punjab DGP. She said that if the allegations are substantiated, the provisions of the IPC should be applied in the First Information Report (FIR). “The accused person should be arrested at the earliest and the detailed action taken report along with a copy of the F.I.R should be communicated to the Commission within 3 days,” she said. NCW calls for strict action In a post on X, the NCW stated that Rekha Sharma called for urgent intervention from the Punjab Director General of Police (DGP) to ensure a prompt and impartial investigation into the matter. “The National Commission for Women is gravely disturbed by a Twitter post alleging inappropriate conduct by Punjab MLA Mr Balkar Singh. The reported acts, if substantiated, constitute serious violations under IPC sections 354 and 354B, directly affronting a woman’s dignity. @sharmarekha vehemently condemn such behavior and call for urgent intervention from @DGPPunjabPolice to ensure a prompt and impartial investigation. A comprehensive report to be submitted in 3 days,” the NCW said in a post on X. Balkar refuses to comment, Opposition questions CM Mann Balkar Singh refused to comment on the allegations, saying that he has no knowledge of the obscene video. “I have no comments and it is not in my knowledge,” Singh told reporters. Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Bikram Singh Majithia questioned Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann about the lack of action against Singh despite ‘all the evidence.’ Punjab is the land of gurus pirs, can there be representatives of the public who are doing unethical work in this land?” he posted on X. BJP leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa also attacked the Aam Aadmi Party over the allegations. “Would CM @BhagwantMann Ji protect Balkar Singh as well just like he shielded Lal Chand Kataruchak, despite their sex tapes being made public??? How many more characterless MLAs AAP has in its kitty???” he asked.",

        "content": "Dear Amy: My wife and I have an older dog that we got when we were first engaged. “Cassie” has grown along with us and now that she is in her elder years, we are protective and concerned about her. Well, about six months ago we fell in love with a small-breed young dog and brought her home. It did not occur to us that this might create a problem. Cassie now seems stressed and unhappy all the time. She tries to hide from the younger dog, who has playfully nipped at her. We spoke with our vet, who suggested “rehoming” the younger dog. She told us that some animal dynamics just don’t work out. We don’t want our elder dog to spend her final years stressed and unhappy. We have learned that friends of ours would like to take the young dog, but we feel so guilty about doing this. We are reaching out for some of your compassionate common sense. – Guilty Dear Guilty: Assuming responsibility for the life, health, and happiness of an animal is an almost sacred stewardship. We owe it to our animals to make the hard choices in what we believe will be in their best interests. And yes, oftentimes guilt follows the hardest choices. You are choosing to protect the more vulnerable animal, and that’s the right thing to do. Dear Amy: “M” reported a “mysterious mourner” at their father’s funeral, which took place many years ago. This mysterious mourner didn’t introduce himself to anyone, leading to speculation that he was perhaps a “love child” of the deceased dad, who had been an alcoholic. It is quite possible that the mourner was a friend from AA. – Friend of Bill Dear Friend: Several readers suggested this. Thank you! “M” was fixated on the thought of having a half-sibling out there, and, according to the narrative, this was a distinct possibility.",

By John C. Azu The Bayelsa State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal has affirmed the election of Governor Duoye Diri. In a unanimous judgement on Monday, the three-member panel led by Justice Adekunle Adeleye dismissed the petition filed by the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Timipre Sylva, for lacking in merit. The panel further held that the reliefs of the petitioners were contradictory since they did not tender any electoral material to show that any irregularity occurred during the election. The tribunal also observed that the petitioners were unable to discharge the burden of proof that was placed on them by the law. Reinstatement of Emir Sanusi done in Kano’s best interest –Gov’t BREAKING: Court orders police to evict Bayero from mini palace The panel added that the APC and Sylva failed to show, “polling units by polling units evidence of the non-compliance submitted and how it substantially affected the outcome of the election” The tribunal struck out as incompetent, all the additional proof of evidence as well as statements on oath of some of the witnesses that testified for the petitioners. Sylva had challenged the result of the November 11, 2023 governorship election which saw the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declaring the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) with 175,195 with APC’s 110,108. Sylva further contended that INEC also excluded results from three local governments of Southern Ijaw, Ogbia and Nembe. Governor Diri commended the judiciary for upholding his victory and the wishes of the people. He vowed not to be distracted in his commitment to serve the people of the state. Meanwhile, Sylva has vowed to challenge the outcome of the election at the Court of Appeal after meeting critical stakeholders of the party. “No quantum of miscarriage of justice will make us lose confidence in the Nigerian judicial system,” he said.

This week, the pregnant beauty brand founder posted a series of snaps , one of which included a selfie of her wearing a small strawberry sticker on her forehead. The strawberry design may have looked a bit familiar to some, as Bieber, 27, sent customers a sheet of the stickers when they ordered her strawberry glaze Peptide Lip Treatment upon its release last summer. But the one that she was sporting in her Instagram post was much smaller, with Jenner pointing out in the comments: 'R these rhode pimple patches or am I tripping?' Her observation sent Rhode fans into a tizzy, as they enthusiastically replied to The Kardashians star, 28. In a new series of snaps, Hailey Bieber posted a picture of herself wearing a strawberry sticker on her forehead - which Kendall Jenner believes may be a part of her latest Rhode Skin drop Jenner commented on the photo, writing, 'R these rhode pimple patches or am i tripping?' 'ABSOLUTELY,' one user wrote. Another agreed, 'Omgeeeee good catch @haileybieber can I place an order.' 'Right?! Kendall thinking what I was thinking!!!!' someone else chimed in. One more person even seconded, 'The design is TOO CUTE TY KENNY FOR SAYING LMAO.' Bieber herself even replied to Jenner, leaving her with a cheeky string of side-eye emojis. Jenner and Bieber have been friends for more than a decade, and even 'sealed' their friendship by molding a pot to the shape of their bodies during a pottery class earlier this year. The pals posted the adorable moment on their Instagram stories. 'Friendship sealed @haileybieber,' Jenner captioned the video at the time.

Bieber announced her first pregnancy earlier this month in an adorable Instagram video post with her 30-year-old husband, Justin Bieber.

Bieber wore a skintight, long-sleeved white lace dress that came with a matching head scarf to debut her bump to the world.

        "content": "Revenue worth $100 million to be generated through the export: PTC ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tobacco Company Limited (PTC) has announced the launch of its ‘Made in Pakistan 3.0’ initiative, marking a significant milestone in the company’s history of economic contribution. This initiative aims to export PTC’s modern oral tobacco-free nicotine pouches, Velo, to Japan, potentially generating $100 million annually through all its exports, as estimated by PTC. The launch event was attended by Federal Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan, along with guests from both the public and private sectors and members of the media. Recognized as Pakistan’s first multinational company, PTC has been a cornerstone of the nation’s economy. Over the past five years, the company has contributed over Rs 680 billion to the national exchequer, earning the prestigious ‘Highest Taxpayers Award’ in 2024 in recognition of its substantial fiscal contributions. In April 2019, PTC embarked on its ‘Made in Pakistan’ initiative, aligned with the Government of Pakistan’s export ambitions, focusing on exporting cigarettes and processed tobacco to various countries. This venture has generated over $157 million since its inception, significantly bolstering the Pakistani economy. Building on this success, the ‘Made in Pakistan 3.0’ initiative aims to further enhance Pakistan’s economic standing. The introduction of nicotine pouches to the Japanese market represents a pivotal step in PTC’s commitment to innovation and growth, potentially adding an additional $50 million annually through foreign exchange earnings. Federal Minister Jam Kamal stated, “Today marks a new chapter in PTC’s history. The ‘Made in Pakistan 3.0’ initiative not only exemplifies PTC’s dedication to economic progress but also showcases Pakistan’s capability to produce high-quality, innovative products for the global market.” Minister Kamal added, “Pakistan has always been an ideal destination for foreign investors. The government is doing its best to facilitate large-scale investors at all levels. Today’s event is a testimony to the government’s extended support under the premiership of PM Mian Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif.” British American Tobacco Group’s Regional Director for Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa, Michael Dijanosic, remarked, “It is a proud moment as PTC prepares to export modern oral nicotine pouches to key markets like Japan. This achievement highlights our strong partnership and marks a major step forward for both BAT and Pakistan. Expanding into international markets creates new revenue streams and opportunities, reinforcing our position as global leaders.” PTC’s Managing Director and CEO, Ali Akbar, added, “We are thrilled to expand our reach with Velo and contribute further to the economic development of Pakistan. Our commitment to excellence and innovation drives us to continuously seek new opportunities and markets. I would like to further request the Government of Pakistan to continue extending their valuable support by framing the right regulatory and fiscal regime for this segment, enabling it to flourish. Sensible regulations will certainly determine the long-term success and sustainability of this business.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

        "content": "A JEALOUS man from Mberengwa District in the Midlands Province who fatally stabbed a rival suitor with a knife two years ago following a feud over a woman who had ditched him has been sentenced to an effective 18 years in jail. Hardlife Mudzingwa of Duna Village under Chief Mataruse killed Blessing Mxotshwa of Number 2 Village 19, Tokwe Valley in Shurugwi a week after his ex-girlfriend, Alice Makonese ditched him. Bulawayo High Court judge Justice Bongani Ndlovu who is on circuit in Gweru convicted Mudzingwa, Mberengwa, of murder with constructive intent. Mudzingwa had tendered a plea of not guilty. In passing the sentence, Justice Ndlovu condemned Mudzingwa’s conduct saying he deserved a lengthy prison term. “The conduct of the accused was deplorable and lacking maturity. It appears the use of lethal weapons is now being normalised in the Midlands province hence the need to nip it in the bud “An innocent life was unnecessarily lost and courts have time and again bemoaned loss of life through violence. For all these reasons, I find the following sentence appropriate, the accused is sentenced to 18 years imprisonment,” he ruled. Justice Ndlovu said Mudzingwa should have simply respected Makonese’s choice and moved on with his life. Prosecuting, Ms Chipo Hungwe said on April 8, 2022, at stand number 15, Village 14 in Tokwe 3, Valley in Shurugwi, Mudzingwa had an altercation with the deceased resulting in stabling him with a homemade knife on the collarbone and left shoulder. According to a post-mortem report, which was submitted by the State, the cause of death was due to assault, haemorrhagic shock, penetrating abdominal wound, and perforated lower abdominal aorta. In her testimony, Makonese said she had ended her relationship with Mudzingwa and was now in a new relationship with Mxotshwa, which irked Mudzingwa. She told the court that on the fateful day at about 3pm, she met the now deceased at Baba Nigel’s homestead and the two proceeded together to her house where they slept. Makonese heard someone trying to open the door but failed since the door was locked. She said the intruder then entered the house through the window. Makonese told the court that she realised that it was Mudzingwa whom she ordered to leave since they were no longer in a relationship. The court heard that Mudzingwa forced his way into the bedroom and had a scuffle with Mxotshwa and he overpowered him. “He took out a homemade knife from his pocket and tried to stab Mxotshwa, but Makonese grabbed the knife by the blade, and her palms were cut. She jumped out of the house through the window,” said Ms Hungwe. Makonese informed her neighbour Laiza Kombora before she returned home to collect her child and found Mxotshwa’s body lying in a pool of blood. She took her child and proceeded to Ishmael Mudzana’s homestead where she informed him of the incident. The two made a report to the police leading to the arrest of Mudzingwa. Mudzingwa was represented by Mr Tafadzwa Komboni of Jumo Mashoko and Partners.",

        "content": "How Mike Tyson's mystery illness could be deadly... and what it means for his upcoming fight against Jake Paul READ MORE: Mike Tyson, 57, suffers medical scare during flight to Los Angeles By Maiya Focht For Dailymail.Com Published: 14:09 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 14:26 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Fans of heavyweight champion fighter Mike Tyson , 57, are concerned about his health following an alarming scare on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles on Sunday . Tyson, who is set to fight 27 year old Jake Paul in a mere two months, became inexplicably dizzy and nauseous — symptoms that are said to be linked to an ulcer, thought to be in his abdomen. Paramedics boarded the plane in California to deliver immediate medical attention to Mr Tyson. The debacle has led to speculation as to what exactly has happened to cause these odd symptoms, and whether or not it means he will have to delay the long-awaited fight. Concerningly, some research suggests that Tyson could be at risk of developing a more sinister condition, including a catastrophic internal bleed. Mike Tyson suffered a medical scare during a flight from Miami to Los Angeles on Sunday. Stomach ulcers are small sores that develop on the lining of the stomach or small intestine and can cause a host of GI symptoms, from nausea and bloating to vomiting and dizziness. One of the most severe and rare complications of an ulcer is the potential for the sore to turn into a rupture - splitting your stomach or colon open in what's called a perforation, according to the NIH . This is a rare complication, affecting approximately 2 to 14 percent of people with ulcers. When the stomach or colon splits open, the acid and bacteria that they normally contains may spill out into the body, which can lead to a life-threatening condition known as sepsis. Initial symptoms can present a bit like a fever, causing dizziness, nausea and a high temperature. An ulcer stomach perforation and is fatal in about 30 percent of cases. The risk may be a concern to Tyson's doctors, as being hit in the stomach can also cause perforation, particularly in ulcerated regions. Having an ulcer or getting punched in the stomach, 'doesn’t mean you will have a gastrointestinal perforation, but your risk of having one is higher,' according to doctors from the Cleveland Clinic wrote . GOT A HEALTH-RELATED STORY? EMAIL: Health@dailymail.com Advertisement However, more likely is simply that the altitude made the typical symptoms of an abdominal ulcer much worse. The everyday symptoms of an ulcer include burning stomach pain, heartburn and bloating, according to Mayo Clinic . But some people develop more troubling symptoms, like nausea, vomiting or dizziness. Elevation can make GI conditions, like ulcers, worse, according to a 2022 review from exercise scientists at The University of New Mexico. This may be because a change in air pressure affects the amount of vital oxygen available to the body's cells, the authors wrote. If your gut cells have less oxygen, they might not produce the same amount of protective coating that they normally do - which is the body's natural defense against stomach acid and ulcer. Even temporary changes in elevation that happen over the course of a flight could be enough to disrupt your gut, a 2014 study from the University of Zurich found. Despite popular ideas that pin the condition on stress or coffee, ulcers are usually caused by a bacteria, called H. Pylori, according to Mayo Clinic. You can get this bug by contact with an infected person, or bad food or water. Doctors don't quite understand how the bacteria causes ulcers, but estimate that it behind the roughly 4 million cases of the problem in the US. Smoking, drinking alcohol or using over the counter pain medicines like aspirin or Advil can all increase your likelihood of developing an ulcer. Tyson will take on Jake Paul in his return to the ring on Netflix later this year. One study , which looked at data from over 50 million hospitalizations, found that Americans who regularly used cannabis were 18 percent more likely to have ulcers as compared to those who didn't use the drug. Mr Tyson is the founder of Tyson 2.0 a weed company that is worth an estimated $400 million dollars. The entrepreneur has been known to smoke $40,000 worth of pot a month from his California cannabis ranch. It's such a common habit of his, in fact, that he publicly swore it off in previous months to prepare for his July match against Mr Paul. Whatever caused Mr Tyson's ulcer, it might be a dangerous liability ahead of his first fight in years. There's no official recommendation for when professional fighters should put down the gloves. There's no official recommendation for when professional fighters should put down the gloves, and anyone who steps into the boxing ring is at risk for brain damage, Dr. Gail Rosseau, a neurosurgeon at North Shore University Health System in Illinois, told the Grio . But those stakes become much higher as a fighter ages. 'The older you are when you sustain a traumatic brain injury [as in boxing], the less likely you are to recover to your pre-injury status,' Dr Rosseau said. She added: 'the typical time course for recovery from the same blow is longer in the older age group.'

        "content": "May 27, (THEWILL) – Alexer Perez Gopa, the estranged wife of Harrison Tare Okiri, aka Harrysong, has fired back at the singer over his recent claims about her. The singer recently accused her of infidelity, claiming she got pregnant for another man while they were still married. But in a series of posts on her Insta stories, Alexer denied the claims made by Harrysong. In the now-deleted posts, she also alleged that the singer is always broke because he is a chronic cheat. Alexer claimed he infected her with sexually transmitted diseases as a result of his infidelity. She asked the singer to come forward with evidence of her infidelity, adding that she was ready to undergo a DNA test for all her children. Alexer also made several allegations against Harrysong, claiming he bedwets. “Do you all know that Harrysong bedwets? Yes, celebrity wey dey piss for body. Oh, so sorry to break it to u all. I also get to deal with this daily, while calling him my lord. You said I convinced you to get married to me? A 20-year-old girl, convincing a full-grown man to get married to her? “Please make me understand, never knew I was married to a robot who couldn’t make decisions for himself. Same you who told me your ex-girlfriend used charms on you and now your eyes are open since u met me. So, it’s now me that forced marriage on you, really? I never knew my mum married 6 husbands wow, chronic. My mum only remarried when she lost her husband, as I speak, she is happily married with her dowry paid in full. “Since when did it become a crime for a widow to remarry? And what do the words “till do us part” mean? Pained soul, why are you trying to project your insecurities on me? We all know your mum gave birth to 6 children for 6 different men. None of which she was married to. And you, a product of incest. Imagine having 5 siblings and you don’t know who their fathers are. Why throw stones when you live in a glass house? “Wait, did you just say my mum lives in an uncompleted building? Please, you all can go and verify. My mum is sitting comfortably in the house her husband built, let us not forget the house she built for herself. Now Harrysong show me your house, the only legacy your dad left on earth is a mud house which you have no plans of renovating. “Ever since I knew you, we have been on rent. A reasonable man will sit down with his wife and plan a future but Harrison’s plans are always centred on women. If I start to mention the amount of side fowls, both old and young, I know, Instagram will not even contain the names. They even go as far as calling me to threaten me because of you. Harrison is always broke because he is a chronic cheat. “Now let’s come to me, if you are a man or men that I had sexual relations with while I was married to Harrysong, please step forward with evidence. And if there is any way we can run a DNA test on all my kids, including the one I lost, I am open to it because I fear nothing. A clear conscience fears no accusation. “Like I said, you keep projecting your insecurities on me. Harrison, how many times did I get to treat STDs because of you? The only sexually transmitted infections I did not get to treat weekly were HIV and Hepatitis B. You are on Nedu’s podcast spewing shit about me, same Nedu that you warned me about. Same Nedu you said was cunning and was a bad friend when Soso got you arrested,” she wrote. Harrysong married Alexer in March 2021 and they have two children. Their marital crisis unfolded in January after an alleged WhatsApp chat between them surfaced on social media. The chat showed the singer asking his wife to abort a pregnancy. In another conversation, Alexer accused Harrysong of having several side chicks, which he admitted and claimed that they were better than her. The alleged chat, however, prompted a statement from Harrysong. The singer, in the statement, admitted that they were going through a marital crisis while pleading with the public to respect his family’s privacy. Alexer also opened up about their marital issues, adding that Harrysong abused her verbally and physically.",

        "content": "White House issues stark warning to Israel over 'devastating' air strike on Rafah that killed two senior Hamas terrorists and dozens of civilians as Middle East tensions boil 'The devastating images following an IDF strike in Rafah last night that killed dozens of innocent Palestinians are heartbreaking,' White House said READ MORE: Israeli troops exchange fire with Egyptian soldiers By Emily Goodin, Senior U.S. Political Reporter At The White House Published: 19:05, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 19:17, 27 May 2024 e-mail 30 View comments The White House on Monday issued a warning to Israel over an air strike that killed dozens of people in a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah. 'The devastating images following an IDF strike in Rafah last night that killed dozens of innocent Palestinians are heartbreaking,' a spokesperson for President Joe Biden 's National Security Council said. 'Israel has a right to go after Hamas , and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians. But as we've been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians. We are actively engaging the IDF and partners on the ground to assess what happened, and understand that the IDF is conducting an investigation.' At least 45 people were killed by the blast and subsequent fires, according to the Gaza health ministry, including 23 women, children and older people. The ministry said that 249 people were wounded. Israel's strike on Rafah killed at least 45 civilians Yassin Rabia, a Hamas commander, and Khaled Nagar, another senior Hamas official, were the targets and were killed. Israel's military said it was investigating the civilian deaths. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the civilian deaths a 'tragic accident.' Netanyahu said the Israeli Defense Forces tried to minimize civilian deaths by asking Gazans to evacuate, but 'despite our supreme effort not to harm uninvolved civilians, a tragic accident occurred to our regret last night.' He accused Hamas of hiding among the general population, saying: 'For us, every uninvolved civilian who is hurt is a tragedy. For Hamas it's a strategy. That's the whole difference.' The strike caused a fire that blazed through the camp in the Rafah governorate's Tal Al-Sultan area, reducing tents and shelters to ashes. Footage released by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society showed chaotic nighttime scenes of ambulances racing to the attack site and evacuating the wounded, including children. As Palestinians cleared the site on Monday, only blackened metal sheeting and charred planks remained, the tent shelters having been all but obliterated. The strike came after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to immediately halt its offensive of Rafah and officials are trying to restart ceasefire negotiations. A Palestinian man and his children sit in a destroyed room following the targeting or a residential building by an Israeli airstrike in Rafah in the southern Gaza President Joe Biden's administration admonished Israel over the attack It caused caused international outrage. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was 'outraged' over Israel's latest attacks. 'These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,' he said on X. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling must be respected. 'International humanitarian law applies for all, also for Israel's conduct of the war,' Baerbock said. Additionally, Israeli forces exchanged gunfire with Egyptian troops along their shared border that resulted in the death of at least one Egyptian soldier. The IDF this afternoon reported a 'shooting incident' at the border close to the crossing into Gaza, adding that it was discussing the issue with the Egyptian authorities but revealed no further information. 'A few hours ago, a shooting incident occurred on the Egyptian border. The incident is under review and discussions are being held with the Egyptians,' the military said this afternoon in a statement. Cairo quickly confirmed the shooting as a military spokesman said authorities had opened an investigation into the incident.

The storms, so far, have killed at least 21 people, after tornadoes and severe weather struck the central and southern United States. Among them were four children, spurring a statewide emergency declaration in Kentucky, as the mass of severe weather is set to move east Monday. More than 100million people across the East Coast are thus at risk, including the Tristate - where thunderstorms and possibly even a tornado are in the forecast. New York City will be under a red alert from 6pm Monday due to the threat of severe thunderstorms - which is expected to last into the early hours of Tuesday. People in the Big Apple will experience torrential rain, hail, and gusty winds, and hail - which may produce flash flooding. Seven people have died in northern Texas , eight in Arkansas, two in Oklahoma and four in Kentucky - with a fifth person 'fighting for their life,' the Blue Grass State's governor revealed in a press conference called Monday. Scroll down for video: A tornado spins in Eddyville, Kentucky, Sunday - part of a system of severe weather that's so far killed at least 21 people in four states Seven are dead in northern Texas, wreckage was strewn across a property Sunday the day after a deadly series of tornados hit Valley View and much of the rest of the central United States 'Sadly we can confirm that we have lost at least four Kentuckians from last night's storm,' Gov. Andy Beshear said at the emergency conference from the Kentucky Emergency Operations Center. 'That means we know that there are at least four families this morning that have suffered the loss of a loved one less than 24 hours ago that are hurting. 'We ought to rally around them and do everything we can to carry them and the days the weeks and the years to come,' he added - before revealing the uncertain fate for the fifth person is 'fighting for their life.' The four fatalities included a 67-year-old woman in Mercer County, a 62-year-old woman in Hardin County, a 48-year-old woman in Hopkins County, and a 34-year-old man in Jefferson County - all of whom went unnamed. The update brought the nationwide death toll over the Memorial Day Weekend up to 21, after a woman and two of her children saw their home struck by a tornado Saturday night in Valley View, Texas, killing all three. 'It was a really terrible thing,' Benito Esparza, the sole survivor's brother, told CNN in Spanish Monday, of the fate of sister-in-law Laura Esparza and her children Marco, 10, and Miranda, 16. His brother, Refugio Esparza, survived the tornado, but suffered a broken leg and pelvis. 'He lost three people, his wife and two kids,' Benito Esparza said. 'It's not easy.' The mass of severe weather is now set to move east, leaving more than 100million across the East Coast in places like New York City (seen here Monday Morning) are at risk One of at least 20 powerful tornadoes spotted Saturday and Sunday - this one seen in North Texas later Saturday in Cooke County Another eight have died in Arkansas, two in Oklahoma and four in Kentucky - with a fifth person 'fighting for their life' in the Blue Grass State, Gov. Andy Beshear revealed in a press conference called Monday. The update brought the nationwide death toll over the Memorial Day Weekend up to 21, after a woman and two of her kids saw their home struck by a tornado Saturday night in Valley View, Texas. Pictured: Laura Esparza (center) and kids Miranda, 16, and Marco, 10 He added how two of Refugio's older children were not at the home at the time of the tornado, which first surfaced outside the Dallas-Fort Worth area overnight Saturday, and saw at least seven killed. That made it the deadliest tornado in state history since 2015 - leaving residents to dig through the tons of rubble and debris left behind. That distinction was not lost on Benito, who spent Monday morning sifting through the remains of his brother's home for what was left. 'It's a very big disaster for everyone, as you can see,' said Esparza of storm's ongoing effect, as recovery efforts to continue. He further recalled how his three family members died after their trailer was thrusted across a street - a scene that was sadly not unique across the country Saturday and Sunday. There were more than 20 tornado reports within that span ranging from Texas to Missouri, bolstered by several detailing the damage left behind and, of course, the casualties. Elsewhere in Texas, violent storms overtook 18-wheelers, destroyed homes, and brought down power lines - even crushing a Shell station in Cooke County. This left 125 people trapped for a period Saturday night, officials said - revealing how all miraculously were retrieved uninjured. Several of the deaths were reported in Valley View in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park That made it the deadliest tornado in state history since 2015 - leaving residents to dig through the tons of rubble and debris left behind. The area as it was Sunday, as recovery efforts persist Also hit was nearby Denton County, where search and recovery efforts are still underway There, the storms inflicted some of their worst damage - in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas. The system then threatened to bring more violent weather to parts of the Midwest, affecting counties in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kentucky. A slew of deaths in those states were recorded Sunday, mostly from falling trees. One such death was confirmed in Mercer County early Monday, before the governor confirmed four overall had died. That person was pronounced dead along with another in Louisville , where Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed it was a storm-related death. Hours later, the state's governor revealed the tally was up to four - a number that very well could still rise, he said. The trees and homes damaged in those states were hit not only by tornados, but by winds that reached 135mph in some places, leaving some 500,000 without electricity across Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kentucky, and Texas. Out of the 21 who died, seven of the storm-related deaths came from Cooke County, Texas, as well as eight across a range of areas in Arkansas. Juana Landeros, who rode out deadly tornado with her husband and her 9-year-old son when it rolled through the previous night, salvages items from her destroyed home Sunday More damage in Denton county is seen here, as much of the central US was not spared by the twisters A man looks at a damaged car after a tornado hit the day before, Sunday in savaged Valley View The storms left a wide trail of destruction Sunday, before moving northeast into Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky Guadalupe Virgin statue lays among the rubble of a destroyed home in Valley View, which was one of the town's most affected by the tornados and more than 100pmh winds Wreckage is strewn across a property the day after a deadly series of tornados hit the central United States, in an aerial view over the north Texas town near Oklahoma Several cars are seen heavily damaged outside the remains of a Shell gas station, after it collapsed in on itself trapping more than 100 people taking shelter. Miraculously, they all survived unscathed, officials said Another two were recorded in Oklahoma's Mayes County, where trees have been uprooted by twisters all over town, with powerlines down and structures flattened. In Arkansas, The National Weather Service in Tulsa said a survey team found EF-3 damage near the town of Decatur, where at least one tornado hit. Another two hit Beaver Lake and others in Benton County, where three of the eight casualties were recorded. A 26-year-old woman, moreover, was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, as recovery efforts in all four states continue. In addition to the incident described by Esparza, the dead in Texas included two other children, ages 2 and 5, and three other family members also found together in a tornado-struck home in Cooke County. The severe weather, meanwhile, is not over, after it pushed east into the Midwest and the Ohio Valley over the course of Sunday. Missouri was the state hit hardest Sunday, where residents of Mehlville reported a violent storm and possible tornado that destroyed dozens of houses. This saw cities like Chicago, Indianapolis, Nashville, Tennessee, St. Louis, and Cincinnati hit by strong showers and damaging winds, but no tornados, as of writing. It is set to finish off today over the East Coast, where risk of severe weather was issued to mid-Atlantic strongholds such as Baltimore; Washington, D.C.; and Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina. Damage is seen to Tom Jones' home after the roof blew off during a storm Sunday in nearby Claremore, a community just across the border in Oklahoma view storm damage to their next door neighbor's home in the small town, which is located in the foothills of the Ozark Mountains People view more of the storm damage Sunday in the same community, after the weather moved east to other states Two deaths were recorded in Oklahoma's Mayes County (seen here Sunday), where trees have been uprooted by twisters all over town, with powerlines down and structures flattened People view the damage at the town's First Baptist Church, after a curfew was put into effect the night before Businesses in Arkansas were also damaged from the storm, with Home Town Flea Market in Rodgers left in ruins Sunday Eight people overall died as a result of the weather in the state, which left the city in Benton county 'unrecognizable', officials said Missouri was the state hit hardest Sunday, where residents of Mehlville reported a violent storm and possible tornado that destroyed dozens of houses Meanwhile, clean-ups in several counties in those five states continue, as officials continue to look for any others hurt by the disasters There, 27 million people are at risk of strong to severe thunderstorms, with more than 110 million people are at risk of severe weather in general. That includes south of New England, where there is a level 2 out of 5 threat. Meanwhile, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, DC, are at risk for tornadoes, but the chances for any to develop are low, officials said. The travel hubs of Atlanta, New York, and Philadelphia will also have to contend with the prospect of damaging storms, and even the odd tornado. This will likely lead to delayed or canceled flights Monday, as Memorial Day winds to a close. Travelers are urged to check the current weather conditions of the states they are heading to.

New formations of soldiers and “expanded activities” at depots and warehouses in settlements north of Ukraine ’s second city, Kharkiv , have been identified by the Institute of War Studies. Volodymyr Zelensky warned that “thousands” of troops were preparing for a fresh assault, and issued a fresh plea to the West to allow them to fire Western missiles into Russia to halt the advance. A US think tank, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) , however, concluded that the build-up may also be to “stretch and fix Ukrainian forces” which are struggling to hold positions across the front lines. function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) READ MORE: Ukraine dealt blow as Putin's troops claim to have captured key village [LATEST] On a visit to Spain on Monday, Mr Zelensky secured another £850,000 military aid package (Image: Getty) Ukrainian officials are frustrated that they have been banned from striking targets inside Russia with Western missiles, arguing that this has given Russian forces a safe area to prepare ground attacks and fire missiles at Ukrainian cities. Following an attack toward Kharkiv on 10th May, officials have warned that the Kremlin also plans to attack Sumy, which lies 100 miles from Kharkiv. On 3rd May, the UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron said it was up to Ukraine to decide how to use British weapons and insisted it had a right to strike targets on Russian territory. Meanwhile, over the weekend Poland and Sweden gave permission for Ukraine to hit targets inside Russia , along with the secretary general of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg. Pressure is now building on the US to follow the UK, despite concerns that this will escalate the war. Germany and Italy have both ruled out such permission. Don't miss...

On a visit to Spain on Monday, Mr Zelensky secured another £850,000 military aid package but the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sanchez , did not give Ukrainian commanders permission to fire Spanish weapons at Russia . “Spain has been supporting Ukraine for two years. Unfortunately, Russian aggression continues and we have to increase our support,” Mr Sanchez said at a joint press conference. So far, Ukraine has been using domestic drones to hit targets across Russia , mainly oil refineries, railways and military airfields. However, on Monday, sources confirmed that it had struck a Russian nuclear radar station near the border with Kazakhstan, 1,000 miles away. This became the second Ukrainian strike against Russia ’s nuclear missile infrastructure in four days, which comes as a concern to its Western allies, who are worried about further escalation .

        "content": "A flood advisory was issued by the National Weather Service on Monday at 2:02 p.m. in effect until 4 p.m. for Bergen, Essex and Hudson counties. The weather service comments, \"Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.\" \"Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas,\" says the weather service. \"Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood deaths occur in vehicles. Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law enforcement and request they pass this information to the National Weather Service when you can do so safely.\" A flash flood warning is issued when a flash flood is imminent or occurring. If you are in a flood-prone area, move immediately to high ground. A flash flood is a sudden violent flood that can take from minutes to hours to develop. It is even possible to experience a flash flood in areas not immediately receiving rain. A flood warning is issued when flooding is imminent or occurring. A flood advisory is issued when flooding is not expected to be bad enough to issue a warning. However, it may cause significant inconvenience, and if caution is not exercised, it could lead to situations that may threaten life and/or property. A flood watch is issued when conditions are favorable for flooding. It doesn't guarantee that flooding will occur, but it signifies that the possibility exists. In flood-prone regions or while camping in low-lying areas, understanding and following the weather service flood safety guidelines can be a lifesaver: 1. Move to higher ground: 2. Adhere to evacuation orders: 3. Disconnect utilities and appliances: 4. Steer clear of flooded basements and submerged areas: 5. Swift evacuation for your safety: 6. Stay away from floodwaters: 7. Seek high ground if trapped: During periods of intense rainfall, the risk of flooding increases, particularly in low-lying and flood-prone areas. It is imperative to avoid driving through any water on the road, even if it seems shallow. According to the weather service, most cars can be swept away by just 12 inches of rushing water. Prioritize your safety by staying informed and prepared. When heavy rain sets in, the risk of flooding and hazardous driving conditions rises. Whether it's prolonged rainfall or rapid runoff, being prepared is essential. Here are some valuable safety tips from the weather service to ensure you stay safe in heavy rain: Beware of rapid water flow: Maintain safe driving distances: Slow down and stay cautious: Choose your lane wisely: Visibility matters: Watch out for slippery roads: Keep a safe distance from large vehicles: Mind your windshield wipers: By following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down. Stay informed about weather conditions and heed advice from local authorities to make your journey safe and sound.

        "description": "Mike Tyson apparently got sick on a flight to L.A., but does this mean his fight with Jake Paul is in jeopardy?",
        "content": "The eyes of the boxing community quickly turned to “Iron” Mike Tyson on Sunday evening after word spread that the 57-year-old former champion suffered a medical emergency on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles. Tyson has been the center of conversation ever since he agreed to box Jake Paul in July, with everyone from UFC boss Dan White to recent Road House co-star Connor McGregor voicing an opinion on the bout. Naturally, the moment that news of Tyson’s medical flare up made the rounds, fans became concerned that this might jeopardize the sporting event, so Tyson’s reps had to weight in. First, Mike Tyson’s reps had to clear up a prevalent rumor that the boxer’s medical emergency was the reason that the flight to L.A. was delayed more than two hours. As it turns out, the flight was delayed due to an air conditioning malfunction, and had nothing to do with Tyson’s health. As for Mike Tyson’s Sunday night complications, his representatives have said, in a statement issued to The Mirror : Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great. He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare up 30 minutes before landing. He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him. However, it’s false reporting that his medical attention caused the flight delay. This two hour delay was due to air conditioning issue on the aircraft. That’s all well and good, but what does this mean for Mike Tyson’s planned fight against Jake Paul in July? Will this be the beginning of Tyson making excuses as to why he won’t get in the ring with Paul? Even though Mike will be 58 when he steps in the ring, most still think he’s lethal with gloves on. Jake Paul went so far as to call Tyson “a killer.” Well, have no fear, as Tyson’s reps confirmed to The Mirror that the bout will go on, as planned. Passengers who rode the flight with Mike Tyson reported to In Touch that messages were conveyed to the flight that medical professionals were needed, with about 30 minutes to go in the flight. When the plane landed in Los Angeles, the passengers apparently were delayed another 25 minutes while paramedics boarded the plane to attend to Tyson. Said one eyewitness: He was in first class, but we were an exit row. They asked us to stay on the plane and landed so paramedics could enter. [The stewardess] said something like, ‘He’s a really important passenger so we wanna make sure he’s OK.’ I knew it was him, but I just mouthed the words ‘Mike Tyson’ and she nodded her head yes. Wherever Mike Tyson goes, he’s going to command that attention. But he also brings that heat, especially when trash-talking his opponents , or claiming he’ll “go raw and naked” for his anticipated battle in Texas. Listen, I don’t care how old Mike Tyson is. I’m never stepping in a ring with the man. Godspeed, Jake Paul. Godspeed. Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News",

        "description": "The three current Habs who took part in world championship — Kaiden Guhle, Cole Caufield and Juraj Slafkovsky — return home empty-handed.",
        "content": "Article content Last year, Canadiens goalie Samuel Montembeault left the IIHF World Championship, held in Finland and Latvia, with a gold medal around his neck after playing for Team Canada. This year, former Canadiens forward Tomas Plekanek left the world championship in Czechia with a gold medal as an assistant coach with Czechia. The Boston Bruins’ David Pastrnak scored the winning goal at 9:13 of the third period Sunday as Czechia beat Switzerland 2-0 to become only the fifth country to win the world championship on home ice. David Kampf added an empty-netter in the final minute in front of 17,413 fans who went wild at the O2 Arena in Prague. The victory kicked off a huge celebration throughout Czechia, including at the Old Town Square in Prague. Fans in Czechia will be thrilled for Plekanec, as will fans in Montreal. Plekanec played in 11 world championships for Czechia, but never won a gold medal. He did win two silver and three bronze medals. The 41-year-old retired as a player last October because of an injury after playing nine games with Kladno in the Czech Extraliga, posting 1-3-4 totals. Plekanec played 15 seasons with the Canadiens and ranks seventh on the list for career games with the club with 984, trailing only Henri Richard (1,258), Larry Robinson (1,202), Bob Gainey (1,160), Jean Béliveau (1,125), Claude Provost (1,005) and Andrei Markov (990). Montembeault took a pass on playing at this year’s world championship , saying he wanted to take some more time to rest his body and then have a full summer to work out in preparation for next season. Canadiens captain Nick Suzuki also took a pass , instead getting engaged to longtime girlfriend Caitlin Fitzgerald at a luxury resort in the Dominican Republic. Canadiens defenceman Mike Matheson also took a pass because his wife, Emily, was pregnant and she gave birth to the couple’s second child on May 17. There were three Canadiens players who took part in this year’s world championship and they all came home empty-handed. Team Canada, with Canadiens defenceman Kaiden Guhle, lost 4-2 to Sweden in Sunday’s bronze-medal game. Guhle missed the game with TSN’s Gord Miller reporting the defenceman was injured while blocking a shot during Saturday’s 3-2 shootout loss to Switzerland in the semifinals. Guhle finished the tournament with 1-4-5 totals and a plus-4 differential in nine games. Former Canadien Sven Andrighetto scored the shootout winner for Switzerland in the semifinals. Team USA, with Canadiens forward Cole Caufield, lost 1-0 to Czechia in the quarterfinals. Caufield finished the tournament with 4-4-8 totals in eight games. Slovakia, with Canadiens forward Juraj Slafkovsky, lost 6-3 to Canada in the quarterfinals. Slafkovsky finished the tournament with 0-8-8 totals in eight games to finish second in team scoring behind Libor Hudacek (5-5-10). “Maybe it’s distorted by the information that I didn’t score a goal, but we did other things,” Slafkovsky told Slovakian reporters . “It could have been better. Sure, it could have been better. Maybe I expected more from myself, but not every championship is as expected. The other boys did well, which I’m glad for, and when it was necessary, they made the decisions. In such a short tournament, it doesn’t matter who scores the goals.” Slafkovsky played on the same line with former Canadien Tomas Tatar, who said the 20-year-old is the most popular player in Slovakia. “He’s huge,” Tatar told Luc Gélinas of RDS, who was in Czechia to cover the tournament. “He has a great personality, which is awesome to see. He’s humble, he’s fun to be around.” Among those cheering on Slafkovsky in Czechia were his two grandmothers. “They didn’t have a chance to come to Montreal yet,” Slafkovsky told Gélinas. “It’s great to see them here and hopefully they have a chance to come (soon) to Montreal.” The 22-year-old Guhle is hoping his performance at the world championship might lead to him earning a spot with Team Canada for the 2026 Olympics as NHL players return to the Games for the first time since 2014. “Obviously, that’s in the back of my mind,” Guhle told Gélinas. “’26 would be pretty crazy I think for me. Olympics, it’s a dream. Ever since I was a kid watching the Olympics was something that I always dream of. Seeing Sidney Crosby score the golden goal in 2010 (in Vancouver), it’s still something that I think about and still have in my memory. Would definitely be a dream come true getting to play for the Olympics and play for Canada.” The next major international competition for NHL players will be the Four Nations Cup , slated for Feb. 12-20 in Montreal and Boston with teams from Canada, the United States, Sweden and Finland. The tournament will replace the NHL all-star weekend, but it won’t include the two countries who played in the world championship final. Pastrnak isn’t happy about that and after winning the world championship posted a photo on Instagram of himself in the Czechia locker room with a gold medal around his neck, the trophy in one hand and a beer in the other, writing: “Maybe Four Nation invite now?” scowan@postmedia.com x.com/StuCowan1",

        "content": "Patna: A law student in Patna died after he was brutally beaten up by over a dozen masked assailants outside his examination centre on Monday evening, police said. The deceased was identified as Harsh Raj, a student of BN College. He had gone to a law college in the Sultanganj area for an exam and was intercepted by the assailants just outside the examination centre when he came out. The assailants fled from the scene after thrashing him. The victim was admitted to the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) where he succumbed due to multiple injuries. Preliminary investigation revealed that the victim was involved in a heated exchange of words with some persons a few days ago, and this could be the reason for the deadly attack. However, the police said they are investigating the matter. “A student named Harsh Raj, who had gone for an exam in a law college located in the Sultanganj police station area, was lynched by more than one dozen masked criminals. The body has been sent to the PMCH for post-mortem. The matter is being investigated. Nearby CCTV footage is being examined,” ASP, Patna City, Sharat R.S. said. Harsh Raj was a resident of Vaishali and was doing his graduation in the state capital.",

        "description": "The head of the National Consumer Protection Agency (BPKN), Mufti Mubarok, said that increasing the price of airline tickets would burden the public.",
        "content": ", - The high price of airline tickets is still widely discussed by the public, especially after Garuda Indonesia president director proposed to increase the price of airline tickets due to high operating costs. The head of the National Consumer Protection Agency (BPKN), Mufti Mubarok, rejected the idea, saying that increasing the price of airline tickets would burden the public. \"Expensive ticket prices will make consumers scream,\" he said on May 25, According to Mufti, ticket prices were already expensive before the increase. He claimed that airlines often violate government-imposed fare caps without strict sanctions from the regulator. \"High operating costs are a classic reason for airlines to raise ticket prices,\" he added. Irfan Setiaputra, president director of Garuda Indonesia, is aware that his proposal to raise the fare cap could trigger public protests. He appealed to the public not to compare domestic ticket prices with international ones, particularly in terms of services. He argued that airplanes are not the main means of transportation, but are used by certain groups who sometimes have certain interests. He hopes people can understand that airplanes come at a high cost. \"As much as 30 percent of our costs are for jet fuel, 30 percent for [aircraft] leases, and 20 to 30 percent for maintenance. Should we have a zero budget for maintenance?\" he said on Wednesday, May 22. Several international airlines offer programs that turn layovers into stopovers at no additional cost. Check out this list. National flag carrier PT Garuda Indonesia records a surge in revenue growth of up to 18.07 percent.

State airliner Garuda Indonesia launched the GarudaMiles Diaspora Indonesia Program in Hong Kong which offers discounts on ticket prices. The Central Statistics Agency or BPS stated that airfares in Ramadan in March 2024 experienced deflation of 0.97 percent. KPPU has scheduled summons to seven airlines to clarify airplane ticket price hikes. The Business Competition Supervisory Commission (KPPU) highlights the spike in ticket prices offered by airlines ahead of the Eid al-Fitr holiday.",

According to a coming before council, if approved definitions will be assigned for “short-term rental” and “principal residence” and the current definition of “bed and breakfast” will be changed to distinguish it from “short-term rental.” Short-term rentals would be permitted in single-family dwellings, to a maximum of one secondary suite or coach house on any lot, in multiple unit residential dwellings, and a maximum of one lock-off suite on any lot provided the property is also the owner’s principal residence. They would be allowed in residential zones, mixed-use zones, agricultural zones, and comprehensive development zones that permit a dwelling unit except caretaker units. Moreover, clarification on short-term rentals would be added to Surrey’s Business License Bylaw specifying that owners on demand by city hall would have to provide evidence that the short-term rental is the owner’s principal residence, that only one booking is allowed at a time, that patron records are kept for two years and that the rental is registered with the provincial government. Also, an annual license fee of $350 will be charged with the duration of short-term rentals being less than 90 days and no limit on the number of bookings per customer each year. A bed and breakfast must not have more than six guests and not more than three guest bedrooms and where boarding and lodging is concerned only two people may be accommodated.",

        "content": "DUBAI: The Arab Media Summit kicked off on Monday in Dubai, with Kuwait represented by Minister of Information and Culture Abdulrahman Al-Mutairi. Under the patronage of UAE Vice President and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammad bin Rashed Al-Maktoum, the summit seeks to contribute to enhancing and developing media content and build bridges of communication and understanding between Arab members of the media, writers, and intellectuals. The summit will continue until Wednesday and is considered the biggest media gathering in the region, where it will discuss the reality and future of the media and create cooperation opportunities between different Arab institutes. On that matter, the President of the Dubai Press Club (DPC) and the organizing committee of the Summit, Dr Maitha bint Eissa Buhaimed, told KUNA that the Summit will continue until May 29 and is considered the umbrella for key events and initiatives. “Focused on knowledge exchange and dialogue in the media industry, the summit will include the 22nd Arab Media Forum, the second Arab Youth Media Forum, the 23rd Arab Media Award, and the fourth Arab Social Media Influencers Award,” she said. “This year’s AMF will bring together a large number of thought leaders, media personalities, editors in chief, influencers, scholars, writers, experts, and content creators from the UAE, the region, and across the world to discuss the future of the region’s evolving media landscape,” she noted. The agenda on Tuesday will include the participation of Kuwait’s Minister of Information and Culture, Abdulrahman Al-Mutairi, in a dialogue session titled “Kuwait to a New Media Decade,” in which he will point out the importance of media cooperation to cope with the comprehensive development that Kuwait is witnessing. — KUNA",

        "content": "Jane Seymour has been widely admired for avoiding cosmetic surgeries and embracing natural beauty as she ages. However, the Harry Wild star revealed her \"best facelift\" during an interview with People Magazine published on Monday, May 27. Sharing the secret to her youthful appearance at the age of 73, Seymour said, \"The best facelift is a smile. If you want to look young, just smile from ear to ear.\" In addition, she follows a Mediterranean diet, practices intermittent fasting, and engages in Gyrotonic training and pilates to maintain an active and healthy lifestyle. The British actress also admitted that once, at the age of 40, she considered a cosmetic procedure for her under-eyes because photographers kept saying she had bulgy eyes. However, doctors informed her that it was actually a muscle issue, which couldn’t be fixed surgically. Referring to this, she quipped, \"I’ve enjoyed quite a good career considering the bulgy eyes.\" \"I’ve been playing a lot of amazing roles recently, including two women with Alzheimer's who have very emotional scenes. If you’re going to be that emotional, you need every muscle in your face,\" Seymour explained. \"So I have nothing against people doing anything they want to do, but for me personally, it is not helping me in my craft, unless I’m playing somebody who’s had Botox, in which case, I would be all over it,\" she added.",

        "content": "View of the Pasig River where the Pasig River Expressway is expected to emerge. INQUIRER.net MANILA, Philippines — San Miguel Corp. (SMC) might still pursue the P81.53-billion Pasig River Expressway (Parex) as it puts the project only on hold for further review, taking into consideration the public’s opinion before proceeding. Ramon Ang, SMC president and CEO, told reporters on Monday in Pasay they were “clarifying” the concerns of the public about the project. “[If] it will benefit more people, why not,” he said when asked if they would still go ahead with the project after postponing it for further review.This showed Ang’s easing of stance about the tollway project as he previously said in March they were dropping it due to adverse public opinion. In 2021, the scientist group Advocates of Science and Technology for the People said the proposed elevated expressway would cause damage to the river as it would block the natural sunlight and “affect the remaining food chain of Pasig River.” Private-sector group Ilog Pasiglahin, in a statement in March, said it was critical to preserve the Pasig River as it is also connected to other bodies of water, including Manila Bay, Laguna de Bay, and the rivers of Marikina, San Juan, and Taguig. Toll Regulatory Board Executive Director Alvin Carullo told the media last week the project was on the final engineering design stage. The planned Parex project is a 19.37-kilometer six-lane expressway passing through the Pasig River from Radial Road 10 in Manila and the proposed South East Metro Manila Expressway at Circumferential Road 6.Following the cancellation of the Parex project, SMC announced they broke ground for the 76.8-km Pangasinan Link Expressway, which is seen to support economic activities by linking the eastern and western corridors of the province. —Tyrone Jasper C.

        "content": "Philippine National Bank (PNB) — INQUIRER.net photo MANILA, Philippines — Philippine National Bank (PNB) will be raising $300 million via a medium-term note offering, to build up its coffers for its financing requirements. In a disclosure on Monday, the Lucio Tan-led lender announced that its board had approved the issuance of the note, with an option to upsize, from its $2-billion euro medium-term note program. The bank, however, has yet to disclose further details about the offer period and interest rates attached to the notes, among others. PNB’s euro medium-term note program was established in 2018 to provide a funding source for the company. In 2019, the listed financial institution raised $750 million via the offshore bond market, drawing down from the program. The offered fixed-rate senior notes maturing by September 2024 have a coupon rate of 3.27 percent per annum. READ: PNB raises $750M via offshore bond issuance The bank also tapped the medium-term note program for the launch of $300-million fixed-rate senior note offerings with a coupon rate of 4.25 percent annually and a tenor of five years. Last month, credit watcher Moody’s Ratings affirmed the bank’s foreign currency senior unsecured medium-term note program rating at “(P)Baa3,” which means moderate credit risk. Moody’s also noted that PNB’s nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio has remained “stable” at 7.3 percent as of end-2023 compared to 7.2 percent in 2022. An NPL ratio indicates how much loans extended to clients have remained unpaid and a lower figure means less credit risk for the lender. Should NPLs rise, banks allocate a bigger credit loss provision, which will eventually hurt their bottom line. In the first quarter, PNB grew its net income by 10 percent to P5.3 million as interest income improved by 17 percent to P16.08 billion. Total assets stood at P1.196 trillion as of end-March, while net loans and receivables amounted to P610 billion and deposit liabilities reached P916.4 billion.

        "content": "A recent decision of the Supreme Court is cautionary to people who sign contracts without reading or understanding their content. The case involved a woman who died of hypertension shortly after she finished her exercise routine at a fitness center. Her husband sued the center for negligence on the grounds that it failed to take her blood pressure and for not having a doctor on-site at all times. The lower and appellate courts decided in favor of the husband, but the high court reversed their rulings and dismissed the claim for damages. It said the center was not negligent because she stated in her application that she was not suffering from hypertension despite her duty to inform it of any medical problem before engaging in any exercise activity. In addition, the center’s records and handouts to its members showed that it had no obligation to take their blood pressure and have a doctor on standby at the premises at all times. This case brings to mind the dismissive attitude of many Filipinos toward written contracts in business transactions that require the accomplishment of supporting documents. Thus, for example, transactions with banks, insurance companies, and car dealers are accompanied by various kinds of documents that spell out in detail the duties and responsibilities of the parties, including the consequences that may arise in case those terms are not complied with. Because those papers often consist of several pages and are written in legalese or arcane business words that can cause a nosebleed to a layperson, their signatories often hardly read them and simply affix their signatures. They assume that the other party would act in good faith and would not take advantage of the trust they’ve given them. Besides, requesting clarifications or asking questions may not sit well with the counterparty who may want to conclude the transaction as soon as possible and receive his or her commission, if any. Those documents may be described as “contracts of adhesion” or agreements that have been prepared by the party with whom a transaction is being forged and, for obvious reasons, contain fine print that is favorable or advantageous to it. These are often cleverly concealed in “provided, however” clauses or references to other provisions elsewhere in the document that require close reading. Under these circumstances, the party being asked to sign them is put in a “take it or leave it” position, with the chances of making changes or adjustments in their terms practically nil lest they result in unsustainable precedents. Although going through those papers may look tedious or time-consuming, it is prudent that they be read carefully and when some items are unclear, to ask for clarification. There should be no room for shame or embarrassment about requesting explanations, if warranted, because once the document is signed (and in most cases, notarized) it becomes binding on the parties. Belated claims that a party did not understand the meaning of some of the terms and conditions or had misinterpreted the consequences of failure to comply with them will not receive a favorable ear if the contract becomes the subject of litigation. Bear in mind, however, that business transactions cut both ways. That is, they would, if satisfactorily completed, be mutually beneficial as they would serve the interests of the contracting parties, so the right to be enlightened on vague provisions should be exercised. Another flaw in the treatment of documents in business transactions is ignoring or making light of disclosure requirements or provisions that request relevant personal or professional information. Because these data are relevant to the transaction under consideration, it is essential that they are accurate or up to date, otherwise the failure to do so could be cited as legal basis to invalidate any claims that may arise from the subject documents. Going back to the case of the disallowed claim for damages, the high court had no choice but to dismiss it because if the rules were bent for humanitarian reasons, it would create an unfavorable precedent on the principle of sanctity of contracts that businesses feel very strongly about.

        "content": "Bureau of the Treasury MANILA, Philippines — Rates on short-dated securities snapped four straight weeks of decline during Monday’s sale of Treasury bills (T-bills) amid hawkish signals from the US Federal Reserve. Auction results showed the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) was still able to fully raise its target amount of P15 billion via T-bills sale. The offer attracted total demand amounting to P38.3 billion, 2.5 times larger than the original size of the issuance. Michael Ricafort, chief economist at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp., said T-bill rates “corrected slightly higher” after some Fed officials hinted at a delayed rate cut, which may have an influence on the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ own easing moves. “Treasury bill average auction yields corrected slightly higher after slightly declining for four straight weeks, after consistent higher-for-longer signals from most officials and from the Fed minutes recently that reduced the odds of a rate cut,” Ricafort said in a commentary sent to journalists. READ: Less hawkish central bank tempers T-bill rates According to the BTr, the 91-day T-bill fetched an average rate of 5.719 percent, more expensive than 5.712 percent in the previous auction. The yield on the 182-day debt notes stood at 5.886 percent, higher than 5.864 percent previously. The 364-day T-bill fetched a rate of 6.043 percent, up from the previous auction’s 6.007 percent. The Marcos administration plans to borrow P585 billion from local creditors in the second quarter of 2024—the same as the financing program in the first quarter. Under the plan, the government is targeting to raise P195 billion via T-bills and P390 billion via Treasury bonds. Overall, the Department of Finance had announced a bigger borrowing plan for this year at P2.57 trillion—from the old program of P2.46 trillion—as the government raises funds to plug a bigger-than-previously-expected budget hole of P1.5 trillion.

        "content": "A new drama has unfolded amid the “ghost employees” scandal haunting the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). On Monday, Monetary Board (MB) member Benjamin Diokno said he “strongly objects” to the “allegation” that the BSP was “politicized” during his term as central bank governor from 2019 to 2022. He issued a strongly worded statement related to the scandal hounding his two fellow MB members—Bruce Tolentino and Anita Linda Aquino, whose offices allegedly hired ghost employees who may have been on the BSP’s payroll for over a year. READ: BIZ BUZZ: MB seats going vacant soon? Diokno took over the BSP as governor in 2019 when he was appointed by former President Rodrigo Duterte, who also picked Tolentino and Aquino as members of the MB, the highest policy-making body of the BSP. “I’m proud of what I did as BSP governor,” Diokno said, adding that Duterte “has respected the independence of the BSP during the most difficult period in the Philippines’ recent history.” “President Duterte never called me to influence monetary policy. It was never politicized,” an incensed Diokno said. Sources said the BSP wants to recover a “significant” amount of salaries and bonuses paid to the ghost employees, as well as give the MB members tied to the controversy an “orderly exit.” That said, the scandal could potentially trigger a major revamp of the MB at a time the BSP is battling stubbornly high inflation and tackling a volatile peso. And markets are watching how the BSP would come out of this crisis that has brought reputational risks to an institution revered for professionalism. —Ian Nicolas P. Cigaral During the Philippine Economic Briefing in Pasay on Monday, tycoon Ramon S. Ang made his stance clear on the country’s territorial dispute against China in front of top government officials. The chief of San Miguel Corp.—an industry giant with diverse business interests including Petron Corp.—told the country’s economic managers the contested West Philippine Sea would benefit the country in terms of oil production. “We have a very big reserve at the West Philippine Sea. That’s why they’re very interested in the Philippines,” said Ang, who was standing tall and poised in the middle of the Philippine International Convention Center’s reception hall as he delivered his short speech. “Let’s not let go of it. We should claim our territory,” he stressed. A round of applause filled the room after. The Department of Energy estimated in 2021 that the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone has 6.2 billion barrels of oil reserves. — Tyrone Jasper C. Piad The government is eyeing bigger private sector participation in the capital buildup of Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), as the state-run lender moves to beef up its buffers following its hefty contribution to the country’s nascent sovereign wealth fund. The Department of Finance’s (DoF) version of a bill seeking to amend DBP’s 26-year-old charter included a proposal to allow the lender to float 30 percent of its capital stock for public ownership, instead of the 20-percent minimum requirement that corporate regulators currently impose to publicly listed firms. READ: IPO seen to strengthen LandBank, DBP Such a proposal came from the DoF, not from DBP, according to Michael de Jesus, company president and CEO. The bank official said such an amendment would give DBP “more flexibility” in raising capital and “encourage” investments from the private sector. De Jesus said that, at the end of the day, the government would still own more than 67 percent of DBP. ”It’s still a super majority,” he said.

At the heart of the charter amendment is the increase in DBP’s authorized capital stock to P300 billion, from the current P35 billion. The proposed capital hike, in turn, would pave the way for the bank’s stock market debut. — Ian Nicolas P. Cigaral",

        "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Cyberattacks targeting Philippine businesses surged by over threefold last year as threat actors stepped up their game amid increasing digitalization, according to Kaspersky. In a statement on Monday, the Russian cybersecurity firm reported that web-based attacks aimed at local enterprises surged to 1.69 million last year from 492,567 in 2022. Web attacks come in different forms, including the typical phishing emails embedded with suspicious web addresses linking to fake websites. The goal of cyber attackers is to illegally obtain sensitive and personal data they can use to take over one’s bank, e-wallet, and other accounts. Perpetrators have remained active because of financial motivation. With a successful account takeover, they can siphon off money and transfer the amount to their own accounts. Southeast Asia, in total, dealt with more than 13 million cyberattacks last year—about the same amount it fended off in 2022. Kaspersky tracked most of the digital threats in Indonesia with nearly five million attacks, followed by Vietnam with about two million. READ: PH faces more cyberattacks from China-based hackers More than 36,000 online attacks were deployed every day last year in the region, Kaspersky noted. “As most governments in the region build and boost their policies to foster their digital economy and infrastructure, it is urgent for local businesses to prioritize strengthening their cyber defenses against threats lurking online which can hamper their efforts to harness the benefits digitalization brings about,” said Yeo Siang Tiong, Kaspersky general manager for Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, Kaspersky also blocked nearly 300,000 ransomware attacks last year in the region. Most of these were detected in Thailand with 109,315 incidents, followed by Indonesia, with 97,226, and Vietnam with 59,837. The Philippines came next with 15,312 ransomware attacks foiled during the period. READ: PH cyberdefenses building up; attacks down in 2023 Ransomware is a cyberattack whereby hackers hold an entity’s network hostage until a ransom is paid. The disruption in operations caused by such cyberattacks is detrimental to the business due to spending related to the retrieval of their data or system, in addition to opportunity costs because of the downtime.

The person driving the $1 million boat told the Coast Guard over the radio that their vessel 'struck an object in the water and was taking on water,' according to a press release . The radio mayday was made at 11:37 a.m. The Coast Guard coordinated with county authorities and 'nearby good Samaritans' to assist in the rescue. A marine unit from St. John's County Fire and Rescue reached the sinking boat first and got both people out safely. One of the boat's passengers sustained minor injuries and was transported to a hospital, Boat International reported. 'We extend our heartfelt gratitude to St. John's County Fire and Rescue for their invaluable assistance during this case,' said Senior Chief Petty Officer Ricardo Santacana, a Coast Guard Sector Jacksonville command duty officer. The yacht is seen tipping over to its starboard side, or the right side. Rescue boats surround the $1 million vessel Santacana continued: 'With the weather improving and mariners heading out onto the water, it's imperative for everyone to verify the presence of all necessary safety equipment aboard their vessel. 'This ensures that responders, as demonstrated in this case, can swiftly locate you and render assistance when an emergency arises.' Additional photos from rescue teams show that the boat took on water and eventually went vertical before slipping beneath the water. The ship that sank, called 'Atlantis,' and has a top speed of 45 knots, or about 51 miles per hour. The boat is about to go vertical moments before it completely sinks off the coast of St. Augustine Beach The yacht has clear signs of damage as it's about to capsize. The cause of the sinking is still being investigated and the owner will have to arrange salvaging plans for the wreckage It's unclear what 'object' the yacht hit, but there are at least seven reefs off the coast of St. Augustine Beach, where the vessel ultimately sunk. The owner of the capsized vessel will arrange to have it salvaged as authorities investigate what caused the crash.

The royal family has postponed engagements \"which may appear to divert attention or distract from the election campaign\" after Rishi Sunak called a surprise summer General Election for 4 July. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: \"Following the Prime Minister’s statement this afternoon calling a General Election, the royal family will, in accordance with normal procedure, postpone engagements that may appear to divert attention or distract from the election campaign. Their Majesties send their sincere apologies to any of those who may be affected as a result.\" While the D-Day commemorations on 5 and 6 June and Trooping the Colour on 15 June are expected to go ahead as planned, there is no confirmation as to whether the upcoming Japanese state visit, which was previously postponed due to the pandemic, will still happen in late June.

        "description": "An inside source has claimed Kate is focusing on her mental health.",
        "content": "A royal source has claimed Princess Kate may not be returning to work for the ”rest of the year” as she continues her cancer battle. Speaking to the Daily Beast last week, an insider close to the princess, 42 - who heartbreakingly revealed her cancer battle in March - has claimed the mother of three currently has an “empty” diary for the rest of the year, insinuating she may not return to public facing duties until 2025. “Lots of people involved in planning need to know what all the principals are doing a long way in advance,” the source said. “I am told that Kate’s diary for this year is empty. There is nothing planned. She may not appear in public for the rest of the year.” The insider continued to allege that the princess is largely focused on her mental health and is doing everything she can to avoid any compromising situations, “The key thing for her now is avoiding any kind of stress or anxiety and just getting on with the business of getting better,” they said. Referencing Prince William and the couple’s three children, Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 9 and Prince Louis, 6, the source added, “They will bail out and be off to Sandringham the moment school breaks up.” Elsewhere, Page Six has reported that parents whose children attend the same school as William and Kate’s have not seen the future Queen for months. “There have been rumours she has done drop-off, but I haven’t seen her since the video,” one parent told the outlet. “We all feel very protective of her. Ask anyone at the school — they are amazing parents.” It comes after a source shut down claims that Prince Harry sought to mend his estranged relationship with Kate and William after her cancer diagnosis, insisting any chance of a reunion is “a fantasy”. “Meeting with Harry is the last thing that William or Catherine want or need right now,” the source said. “It’s a fantasy. It’s not about apologies or who said what, it is about protecting his family. Kate is recovering from cancer, and they are avoiding stressful situations.” They continued to claim if the Sussexes believe they will “descend on Balmoral this summer” it would be “wishful thinking”. “It’s all just very sad,” the source said. Rumours first began swirling about the alleged phone call when royal expert, Tom Quinn claimed, “Since leaving the UK, Harry has actually contacted at least one royal: Kate.” He added, “She is sympathetic, but fully supports her husband and, struggling with her own health problems, has no intention of playing peacemaker.” Kate announced in March she was undergoing treatment after doctors detected cancer in her body following her major abdominal surgery in January in The London Clinic. She said in the short video: “In January, I underwent major abdominal surgery in London and at the time, it was thought that my condition was non-cancerous. The surgery was successful, however, tests after the operation found cancer had been present. “My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventive chemotherapy and I’m now in the early stages of that treatment.” The princess solemnly confessed the news had come as a “huge shock” and continued to praise her husband for his support during “an incredibly tough couple of months for our entire family”.

        "content": "A bakery that was hit with nearly 20 infractions earlier this year has been shut down by Toronto health inspectors. New King of Kings Bakery, which received 18 infractions in March but remained open after receiving a conditional pass, is closed until further notice. The bakery, which offers fresh baked goods and boasts a hot table with everything from turkey to fried fish, had previously passed with no or minor infractions prior to March’s inspection. However, New King of Kings, located at 248 Eddystone Ave. in North York, was forced to shut down after health inspectors issued it a summons and health hazard order on Friday, according to Toronto Public Health . The first of two new crucial violations pertained to the food premises being maintained in a manner permitting a health hazard, specifically insects. The other crucial infraction was that the establishment was “maintained in a manner permitting adverse effect on food,” but the bakery received a “notice to comply” action for the issue. The bakery received five additional infractions — four significant and one minor. The four significant violations were that it failed to protect against the breeding of pests, used food equipment not of readily cleanable form, did not maintain hand-washing stations with soap and paper towels and did not provide an adequate number of hand-washing stations. The one minor infraction was that its equipment surfaces were not sanitized as necessary. A detailed list of infractions at Toronto restaurants can be found on DineSafe .",

'Eamonn was desperate to return to Belfast, which he thinks of as home, but Ruth would never move. It became a bone of contention.

Eamonn spoke about his desire to return to Belfast last year, revealing how his wife was always 'very irritated' when he called it home. He said last year, when asked where he thinks of as home: 'Well, it's not Surrey. When people ask me what I'm doing at the weekend, I tell them I'm going home. 'Then my wife gets very irritated by this. She says, 'This is your home. And I say, 'No Ruth, this is where I work. This is where I have to be, but home...'

        "content": "Questioning the Centre’s position on China, Congress candidate Shashi Tharoor on Monday said the Bharatiya Janata Party’s position on Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) is only an “election tactics” adding that it must also focus on what is happening on the Chinese borders. Union Home Minister Amit Shah recently made a statement that PoK is a part of India and it will be taken back once BJP retains power. Reacting to this, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said, “These are all election tactics. Those who talk about PoK, don’t think about what impact it will have internationally. What they have done about China? On 65 patrolling points, the agreement was going well in the last 45 years. But, now at 26 points, the Chinese military is there and our Jawans can’t go, when they tried, 20 of our Jawans were killed. The government is in no position to talk about this and they are talking about the PoK. It’s nonsensical to talk such things.” On Amit Shah claiming that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has crossed 310 marks in the five phases of the ongoing Lok Sabha elections, Tharoor said, “Whatever Amit Shah says about the number of seats, we should discount it by 30-40 per cent, then we will see the reality. I think it’s (NDA to cross 400) not going to happen, BJP is in a bad state and the time has come for a change in the government”. Regarding the potential Prime Ministerial candidate for the INDIA alliance, if it comes to power, Tharoor remarked that the decision would involve consultation among the 26 parties. “Twenty-six parties collectively ponder over this matter. With so many leaders among them, there shouldn’t be much concern. After all, it’s not a Presidential system. Prime Minister Modi seems to be operating the parliamentary system as if it were a Presidential one. In a Presidential system, everyone casts their vote for a single individual.In a parliamentary system, we consider the party, various candidates, and then select a leader. In the 2004 elections, who could have predicted that Manmohan Singh would emerge as the leader?” Tharoor said. (ANI)",

        "content": "Yomi Faparusi, a Nigerian-American based in Tennessee, in the United States, is vying as an independent candidate to represent Tennessee District 5 in the US Congress. The election is slated for November 5, 2024. Faparusi, who made this known while speaking during a virtual meeting with reporters at the weekend, said his victory in November 5, 2024 election would inspire the next generation. He said there is hyper-inflation in the country, making it hard for the generality of the people to survive. He added that the middle class is disappearing, and that the American dream was threatened. Faparusi, who is a researcher, said he is contesting because America is divided and weakened, and that he was running to unite Americans across various divides. “America is so divided and weakened because politicians now run on divisive and wedge issues. Hence, I decided to run as a unifier, so that things can get done. I also hope my victory in November would inspire the next generation. “There is inflation making it hard to make ends meet; the middle class is disappearing, and the American dream is threatened. I want to tackle inflation. I want to create an environment that is conducive to small businesses, the most important units of job creation. “Congress is in stalemate, and nothing is getting done. I will work across the aisle for the common good. Americans are tired of cyclical threats of government shutdowns. “Immigration is in total disarray. Open borders are not a policy; it only makes it hard to have a comprehensive plan. Immigration is not only a social issue; it is a financial/economic issue: you don’t have papers; you can’t get a job. “The reality is that most legislators would not entertain any immigration relief package unless the border is secure. Hence, we need to secure the border and get back with a bipartisan comprehensive immigration plan. “I am running as an Independent because I do not want to be beholden to any party. I still have a political ideology. There is something called an advantage of incumbency, but incumbents lose, as I hope in November. The TN 5th district is ideologically diverse, and it needs to be represented by someone who understands and appreciates this diversity. I will represent all the people and not just a partisan segment. “I am a business owner and I know about job creation. Also, I have had to work with diverse stakeholders hence I learnt how to listen and be humble. These have allowed me to be a good negotiator in any forum. “As an immigrant and now an immigration attorney, I know the practicalities of immigration. “As simplistic as it seems, the theme of my agenda is ‘I care’. I care about your concerns, and I want to go to Washington to serve you. I hope that you will give me a chance to represent you and I will always be answerable to you, my constituents. I will advocate for your concerns and needs without fear of retribution because I have placed the people above party. At the end, everything will be okay.” Faparusi was born at the University of Ibadan, Oyo State, while his ancestral hometown is Ode-Ekiti, Gbonyin LGA of Ekiti State. He graduated as a medical doctor from the College of Medicine, University of Ibadan. He was into students’ union politics, where he served as the Hall Chairman of Alexander Brown Hall, while he was in school. He is a licensed physician (medical doctor) and a licensed attorney (Lawyer) based in Tennessee. He has a law practice where he focuses mostly on immigration law. Faparusi, who was involved in the agitation against military rule during the Abacha regime in Nigeria, fled Nigeria to escape being persecuted by the tyrannical military regime.",

        "description": "Blood and bodies are only but a fraction of the true cost of war.",
        "content": "No one wishes to endure such a moment. When the rifles shatter the silence, a jolt of disbelief grips you, underscoring the solemn significance of the salute. This is swiftly followed by the eerie strains of Taps echoing through the air. Military honors at the funeral of a fallen soldier are jarring, and surreal; standing beside grief-stricken families who wonder what it all means. It is the price that some soldiers have paid, and the burden some families bear when a Soldier comes home from combat under a flag draped coffin. This is a heartache my own family knows all too well, having lost my older brother in 1995 during a training exercise at the U.S. Army Airborne School. Although it was a peacetime incident, I intimately understand the overwhelming sorrow felt as a folded flag is handed to a mother and father, a symbol of a nation’s deep gratitude and solemn respect. This is a scene that has played out time and again in our nation’s history. The cost, in human bodies, of America’s bloodiest war, the Civil War was 498,332. Bloodier than all the previous wars combined. Fought to ensure that government ‘of the people, by the people, and for the people’ would not perish from the earth. The toll was so bloody, it required the government to establish the first national cemeteries. At various times of the year, across the country, citizens took to decorating the graves with flowers and flags to honor those who had died. Later it was formalized as Decorating Day, before eventually becoming Memorial Day as we know it today. The cost to America, in human bodies, of World War I was116,516. My own division, the Rainbow Division, represented by a rainbow patch, took heavy casualties in the war. In the bloody fields of Europe, surviving soldiers cut their rainbow patches, leaving half where their slain comrades lay. It is the reason we wear a half rainbow patch today. The scene was memorialized by the words of poet John McRae who wrote of the poppies in Flanders Fields. In Flanders fields the poppies blow Between the crosses, row on row, That mark our place; and in the sky The larks, still bravely singing, fly Scarce heard amid the guns below. We are the Dead. Short days ago We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, Loved and were loved, and now we lie In Flanders fields. 405,399. The cost to America, in human bodies, of World War II. 36,574. The cost to America, in human bodies, of the Korean War. 58,220. The cost to America, in human bodies, of the War in Vietnam. 1,190,085 . The cost, in human bodies, of all the wars that America has waged. From the Revolution through the Global War on Terror. Yet, blood and bodies are only but a fraction of the true cost of war. It fails to calculate the torment of those left behind. The families who were forever broken by their “sacrifice upon the alter of freedom,” whose pain cannot be assuaged. And the cost calculated in the loss of human potential. Not just the loss of the youth and vitality of those who made the final sacrifice, but what we collectively lost by the unrealized potential of the 1.2 million and what they could have become. Because we know something about those who serve. We know that they are likely to be married, and that 58% would have had at least one child, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics . That’s nearly 1 million children never born. Over two thirds would have gone to college and sought a degree. Most would work in management, business, science, the arts, and transportation. They would have had higher incomes than their non-veteran counterparts. We also know (according to the 2021 Veterans Civic Health Index ) that they would have been more likely to work in public service or in a charitable organization than their non-veteran counterparts; more likely to start their own business; more likely to volunteer, belong to a group, and contribute to the causes they believe in. They would have been more likely to help their neighbors, and to do things that contributed to their neighborhoods. They would have been more likely to vote, to talk to family and friends about politics, and to give money to a political party. And five times more likely to work for the Federal government. In essence, dedicated citizens, servants, and leaders. It is altogether fitting that we should take time to remember all these we lost, and thanking the military, our servicemembers, and veterans a priority. The question for us during Memorial Day is how do we best remember the past? How do we best honor the lost? By serving. By defending. By the contributions we yet make while we are living. By taking action and giving just a little bit extra on behalf of those who no longer can. And in so doing, the collective efforts of each of us adds to the memory and the honor of 1,190,085.

Now Julia Bednarek will be amongst a host of other Premier League WAGs. Snapchat is an app largely used by a younger audience and is popular for its feature of only being able to view messages once, but it was Southampton defender Jan that originally messaged Julia on the app to kickstart their romance. Julia originally hails from Poland and first met her husband and his parents in a daunting first date experience when Poland played Kazakhstan in a previous international match between the pair.

Revealing how the pair first met, she previously told Super Express: 'Janek and I met on the Internet. He wrote to me on Snapchat and that's how it started. 'We started texting each other every day, then we talked on FaceTime, because Janek was in England and I was in Poland. It was hard to meet. 'And the first time I saw him live was at the Poland-Kazakhstan match, where I first met his managers, then Janek's parents and then him!'. Sofia Lepore - Will Smallbone's girlfriend (Southampton) The girlfriend of Saints midfielder Will Smallbone is different to a host of Premier League WAGs due to the Italian possessing a university degree after graduating two-years ago. Lepore graduated from Birmingham University with a Batchelor of Arts degree in Political Science & International Relations, but has largely been enjoying the luxuries that often come with having a footballer boyfriend since. Her Instagram page shows Lepore has been an avid traveller in recent years with destinations around the globe including party island Ibiza, Dubai, and the picturesque Santorini to name a few.

Summer Godbold - Flynn Downes' girlfriend (Southampton) The girlfriend of Flynn Downes has been with him throughout the majority of his senior career at both West Ham and Southampton, and is now hoping to join the exclusive club of Premier League WAGs. Godbold is never far away from the pitch whenever the midfielder is playing and regularly celebrates with Flynn Downes, even getting onto the turf at St Marys when the Saints booked their spot in the playoff final. The stunning blonde already appears perfectly trained in the WAG lifestyle, taking snaps in luxury designer outfits and jetting off to destinations such as Dubai, Paris and Rhodes. However, Flynn Downes is currently only on loan at Southampton, with a decision yet to be made on his future by parent club West Ham.

Jones would drive Brooks to appointments for treatment on stage-two Hodgkin lymphoma and would sit with him following chemotherapy sessions, with Brooks later receiving the all-clear and returning to the pitch after 500 days in March last year. The pair are never far away from each other and got engaged last year as Brooks proposed to Jones in a luxury setting in the Indian Ocean island nation of Mauritius.

Rebekah Vardy - Jamie Vardy's wife (Leicester) Read More Rebekah Vardy says she no longer cares about Wagatha Christie trial and insists she 'knows the truth' after losing high court battle with Coleen Rooney Perhaps one of the most famous partners of a player in English football, in large part due to her involvement in the Wagatha Christie scandal back in 2022. Coleen Rooney's accusations that the wife of Leicester City star Jamie, was leaking posts from her private Instagram account to The Sun and the line 'It's Rebekah Vardy's account - sparked a media storm between the pair. Vardy sued Rooney for libel and the case came to a halt in May 2022 when the court dismissed her claim insisting that the statements by the wife of Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney were substantially true. She was left with a £3m court fee, but back in December she said she no longer cares about the trial and 'knows the truth'. Vardy is perhaps best famed for the Wagatha Christie saga which Coleen Rooney accused her of leaking messages to the Sun Despite losing her court case, Vardy said she no longer cares about the Wagatha Christie saga Vardy wrote: 'I certainly didn't expect what became known as the 'Wagatha Christie' trial. If you care, you'll know the details. If you don't, I'll spare you: thinking about it is a total waste of time and energy. All I'll say is that I know the truth, as do many others.' Rebekah has five children, three of which are fathered by Jamie, who also another child from a prior relationship. Former Premier League title winner, Jamie, is now 37, and approaching the end of his football career. However, he is still ruthless in front of goal and scored 20 goals in all competitions -- including 18 in the Championship - as he prepares to take to the top flight one more time. Before Leicester's relegation last season, he had scored 136 goals in 307 games - putting him 15th on the list of all-time top scorers since the Premier League's inception. Rebekah and Jamie have three children together, as well as both having children from prior relationships Suwilanji Mpondela - Patson Daka's wife (Leicester) Another Foxes striker returning to the Premier League is Patson Daka, who is married to Zambian sprinter Suwilanji Mpondela. They are one of the most famous celebrity couples in Zambia, with Daka set to return to the top flight of English football, and Mpondela a 100m sprinter. She computed at the U20 World Championships back in 2018, and in 2021 she along with her 4x100m relay team-mates set a new national record with a time of 43.85 seconds. In 2019, she was voted in as the inaugural chairperson for the National Olympic Committee of Zambia - making her Africa's youngest elected Athletes Commission Chair at the age of 19. The couple got married in Dubai in November 2022.

Speaking to CBS Sports , Hermansen said his absorption of other sports have helped him in his role as a goalkeeper. One of which is ice hockey - a sport that his girlfriend Sofie Rosenkilde competed in. He said from ice hockey it has improved his one-on-one blocking, positioning, and using defenders to screen the goalkeeper. Rosenkilde regularly shares updates of her life on Instagram to her more than 4,000 followers. She recently supported him at the EFL awards where he was named in the Championship Team of the Season. In a message on Instagram she wrote that she was 'beyond proud' of the 23-year-old Danish goalkeeper.

        "content": "Despite an alert issued from the administration and India Meteorological Department (IMD), fishermen were seen fishing in the Mohana near Digha area in West Bengal’s East Medinipur district on Monday in the wake of the landfall of Cyclone ‘Remal’. The IMD has issued an alert message and warned the fishermen not to venture into North Bay of Bengal along and off West Bengal and Bangladesh coasts on May 27. On the other hand, a large number of tourists visited Digha beach on Monday. The Cyclonic Storm “Remal” (pronounced as “Re-Mal”) over Coastal Bangladesh and adjoining Coastal West Bengal moved nearly northwards, with a speed of 15 kmph during past 06 hours and lay centered at 0830 hrs IST of today, the 27th May, 2024 over the same region, near latitude 22.8°N and longitude 89.3°E about 40 km northwest of Mongla (Bangladesh), 90 km east of Kolkata (West Bengal), 90 km northeast of Canning (West Bengal), 130 km northwest of Khepupara (Bangladesh) and 140 km southwest of Dhaka (Bangladesh). West Bengal Power Secretary Santanu Basu said, “South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas, Howrah, Hoogly, parts of Medinipur, Murshidabad, and Nadia districts have been affected by cyclone Remal the most. We started our restoration work early in the morning today...” “We have been able to restore 45 out of the 50 substations that were affected and 80% of the restoration work, be it in the substation level or in the downstream infrastructure with respect to the 33kV feeders or the 11 kV feeders has been restored. In certain areas in the North 24 Parganas, we have been unable to restore 6-7 substations because of the wind and rain... In South 24 Parganas we have been able to restore almost all the substations... We have engagements of additional gangs from the nearby districts which have moved to North and South 24 Parganas to help in fastening up the restoration,” he said. The Cyclone is likely to move north-northeastwards, and gradually weaken further into a Deep Depression by night of Monday. “The severe cyclonic storm ‘Remal’ has weakened since making landfall last night and is expected to downgrade into a deep depression by this evening,” the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) announced on Monday. The NDRF made the announcement based on the latest update from the India Meteorological Department (IMD). “The current information that we have from the IMD is that the severe cyclonic storm has now transformed into a cyclonic storm. The wind speed, which was earlier about 110 to 120 km/hr during landfall, now has come down to 60 to 70 km/hr,” NDRF Deputy Inspector General Mohsen Shahedi told ANI when asked about the status of ‘Remal’ after its landfall. Pointing out the downfall in the intensity of the cyclone, Shahedi said “This is a big relief and it is expected that by evening today, this will further change into a deep depression.” (ANI)",

        "content": "The Alaska House of Representatives chamber, photographed on Monday, Jan. 16, 2023 at the Alaska State Capitol in Juneau. (Loren Holmes / ADN) With days remaining before the filing deadline for Alaska’s legislative candidates, more than a third of the state’s 40 House members are poised to run for reelection unopposed. Candidates have until June 1 to formally declare their intent to run with the Alaska Division of Elections. Some candidates wait until the last minute to file their paperwork. But in large swaths of the state, lawmakers could keep their seats with little or no competition. The 2022 election led to the largest freshman class of lawmakers in two decades, with 20 out of 60 lawmakers new to the Alaska Legislature. The change was brought about in part by a one-a-decade redistricting process that put multiple incumbents in the same districts, and allowed newcomers to run outside the shadow of longtime politicians. But 2024 is set to bring far less turnover. In the Senate, every incumbent up for reelection has indicated an intention to run again. In the House, only three lawmakers have indicated they don’t plan to attempt to keep their seats — creating limiting possibilities for open races. Rep. Jennie Armstrong, D-Anchorage, whose Alaska residency was challenged during the 2022 election cycle, is not running again. Democrat Carolyn Hall is currently the only candidate registered to run for the seat. Rep. Laddie Shaw, R-Anchorage, is retiring this year at the age of 75. Multiple candidates have indicated they could run for the seat, including Girdwood Republican Lee Ellis, a craft brewery president, and Ky Holland, a nonpartisan candidate and entrepreneur. Rep. Ben Carpenter, R-Nikiski, is not seeking reelection to his House seat, instead running for a Senate seat against incumbent Sen. Jesse Bjorkman. The two Republicans differ on key issues, including education funding. Bjorkman voted to override Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s veto of a bill that would have permanently increased education spending, while Carpenter voted to sustain Dunleavy’s veto. Two Republicans have registered to run for Carpenter’s seat — Ben Elam and John Hillyer, both of Soldotna. Elam is a member of the Kenai Peninsula Borough Assembly. Hillyer is a retired Air Force general and pilot. Rep. Jesse Sumner, R-Wasilla, said Thursday that he was still undecided on whether he would run again, after winning the open seat in 2022 a four-way Republican race. He said he was weighing several factors, including his family and his business, and would likely decide whether to run close to the June 1 deadline. Where incumbents do face challengers, several races promise repeats of 2022 match-ups. Rep. Tom McKay, R-Anchorage, will again face Democrat Denny Wells. In 2022, McKay beat Wells in a ranked choice tabulation by seven votes, and the race is again expected to be very tight this year. Rep. Stanley Wright, R-Anchorage, has indicated he plans to run again. So has Democrat Ted Eischeid, who in 2022 lost to Wright by 72 votes. Rep. Dan Ortiz, I-Ketchikan, is again facing Republican challenger Jeremy Bynum. In 2022, Ortiz beat Bynum by 343 votes. Rep. Julie Coulombe, R-Anchorage, will again face nonpartisan candidate Walter Featherly. In 2022, Featherly received over 45% of the vote but was bested by Coulombe in a ranked choice tabulation , after third-place Republican finisher Ross Bieling was eliminated. Rep. Cliff Groh, D-Anchorage, will face Republican David Nelson. Groh bested Nelson in 2022, when Nelson garnered 44% of votes in the district. Rep. Neal Foster, D-Nome, will face Tyler Ivanoff, a member of the Alaska Independence Party from Shishmaref. In 2022, Foster beat Ivanoff by 92 votes. Sen. James Kaufman, R-Anchorage, will face Democrat Janice Park, who lost to Kaufman by more than 1,300 votes in 2022. Sen. Kelly Merrick, R-Eagle River, is set to again face Republican Ken McCarty, along with two other Republican challengers. McCarty, a former House member, ran to the right of Merrick in 2022, and lost to her by more than 2,400 votes. At stake for challengers hoping to unseat incumbents is control of the Alaska House and Senate. The Senate is governed by a 17-member bipartisan coalition that is likely — though not guaranteed — to survive the coming election. But in the House, Republicans narrowly gained control of the chamber in 2023 thanks to support from four non-Republican members of the Bush Caucus, which represents rural districts. Control of the chamber could easily flip, many say, if one or more seats currently held by Republicans are won by Democrats or nonpartisan candidates. A single seat can make a difference in control of the Legislature and in the outcome of key legislation, as lawmakers learned earlier this year, when they failed by a single vote to override Dunleavy’s veto of the education bill. In District 6, incumbent Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer, faces multiple challengers — including nonpartisan candidate Brent Johnson, who is currently the Kenai Peninsula Borough Assembly president. Announcing his legislative bid earlier this month, Johnson cited Vance’s decision not to override the governor’s veto of the education bill, which was broadly supported by public school educators across the state. The announcement foreshadows what lawmakers have discussed behind closed doors ever since Dunleavy vetoed Senate Bill 140 earlier this year: that opposition to veto override vote would come back to haunt some Republican incumbents in their reelection bids. Johnson said in an interview last week that he had first considered running for the Legislature more than a decade ago. But he enjoyed working on his local borough assembly and living in his Clam Gulch home. “I didn’t want to change any of that. And I held that position consistent, even though people asked me to run several times, until the failure to override the governor’s veto of education funding,” Johnson said. Vance is a conservative member of the current Republican-dominated majority, and a key backer of Dunleavy’s policies. Johnson said that if elected, he would look to join a bipartisan caucus, and to rebuke some of Dunleavy’s policies, including in the areas of education and fishery management. The Kenai Peninsula is not the only place where the veto override vote has motivated some challengers to enter a race. In District 40, which includes the North Slope and Northwest Alaska, Robyn Burke, an Utqiagvik Democrat, said she decided to run for the state House after Rep. Thomas Baker, R-Kotzebue, became one of several Republicans who initially voted in favor of the education legislation but later voted to sustain Dunleavy’s veto. “Baker’s vote virtually assured deep education cuts that make it improbable to adequately staff our schools or provide basic materials,” Burke, the North Slope Borough School District board president, wrote in an op-ed that appeared in the Daily News. Burke is one of two challengers who have so far indicated they plan to run against Baker, along with Kotzebue city mayor Saima Chase. Baker was appointed to the seat by Dunleavy after former Rep. Josiah Patkotak was elected North Slope Borough Mayor last year. Baker had not yet filed to run for the seat as of Thursday and did not respond to a message asking if he intended to. Earlier this month, Baker announced on social media that he would change his party affiliation from Republican to undeclared “to more effectively address the specific needs” of his constituents. The primary election is set to take place on Aug. 20. Under Alaska’s election system, the top-four vote getters in every legislative race, regardless of political party, advance to the general election.",

        "content": "The celebration of the “strengthening” of the Russian Black Sea Fleet was short-lived: on May 7, in fact, 2 new units were launched at the Zelenodolsk shipyards in Tatarstan (on the Volga River, engaged since 1895 in building small warships for the Black Sea and Caspian fleets). This is the small attack corvette Tayfun, one of 18 Karakurt/Project -22800-class units under construction since 2015, 7 of which are destined for the Black Sea Fleet, and it will become operational in 2025. The second unit launched is a Project-22160 OPV, the Viktor Velikiy, whose construction started in 2016. The sanctions that followed the occupation of Crimea and the war’s aftermath first slowed down work on the six Vasilij Bykov-class patrol vessels (OPVs), exposing their vulnerabilities to the point where additional weapon systems had to be temporarily installed on the flight deck. While a second batch of 6 appears to be frozen,. Both units belong to models optimized for littoral employment and have suffered several losses. Out of the four Project-22160s that were delivered between December 2018 and July 2022, the Pavel Derzhavin suffered significant damage in October 2023, and the Sergei Kotov, which had minor damage in 2023 as well, was sunk on March 5, 2024 by USV drones. The 94 m and 1. 700 t, 30 knots of speed, stealth design, and flight deck for helicopters and UAVs with telescopic hangar enhance its defensive capabilities. Similar to modular corvettes, it is equipped with a 76 mm AK-176MA gun, a VLS for Kalibr-NK medium-range SAMs, and ASW torpedo launchers among embarked or prearranged systems. As of summer 2022, it also has more 14.5 mm machine guns and remotely controlled grenade launchers, as well as a TOR-M2KM SAM system on the flight deck, albeit temporarily. The twin ASKOLD, which was partially destroyed on November 4, 2023, by Storm Shadow missiles fired by Ukrainian Air Force Su-24s while in the Zalyv Shipbuilding Yard in Kerch to finish outfitting, is expected to have been joined in recent days by the Tsiklon, delivered on July 12, 2023. The Taifun corvette will also replenish a class hard hit by wartime events: a partial replacement. Unconfirmed by Moscow or Kiev, the unofficial Russian sources claimed on May 20 that the modern corvette had been sunk the day before in an ATACMS missile attack in Sevastopol, leaving six crew members dead and eleven wounded. This made for yet another “bad day” for the Black Sea Fleet, which in two years between sunken or partially destroyed ships has seen its prewar strength reduced by 1/3, with the majority of it driven from its most advanced bases. On May 19, the Ukrainians also claimed the sinking, perhaps in the course of the same missile attack, of the minesweeper Kovorets, although again there is no certainty. In fact, it cannot be ruled out that it is still the Tsiklon. The loss of the corvette is certainly more serious: the Kovorets is in fact an old Natya that has been in service for 50 years and would be a minor loss, while the Tsiklon is a small but sophisticated attack ship, armed with an 8-cell VLS for the valuable Kalibr-NK cruise missiles, which have proven to be one of the most dangerous weapons for Ukrainian defenses. Just 67 m long and with a displacement of 800 t, the Kaakutss (stealth-designed and capable of reaching 30 knots), lacking a flight deck but capable of accommodating RHIBs and UAVs, is also equipped with a CIWS Panttsyr-M defense system, a 76 mm AK-176MA gun, remotely controlled machine guns and grenade launchers, and state-of-the-art sensors.",

        "content": "ISLAMABAD: The National Highway Authority (NHA) has increased the toll tax by 35 to 40 per cent for different categories of vehicles, effective from July 1, 2024, ARY News reported on Monday. The toll tax hike will be applicable on national highways, including M-1 (Islamabad–Peshawar Motorway), M-3 (Lahore-Abdul Hakeem Motorway), M-4 ( Faisalabad-Multan Motorway), and M-5 (Sukkur Multan Motorway) with M-15 (Hazara Motorway), and the Havelian-Mansehra Expressway. On national highways, the toll tax for cars has been increased from Rs30 to Rs40, for wagons from Rs50 to Rs70, for buses from Rs100 to Rs130, for 2 to 3 axle trucks from Rs120 to Rs150, and for large trucks from Rs250 to Rs350. For M-1 Motorway, the authority increased toll tax for cars from Rs240 to Rs360, for wagons from Rs400 to Rs550, for 13 to 14 seat coasters from Rs550 to Rs700, for buses from Rs700 to Rs1,000, for 2 to 3 axle trucks from Rs1,040 to Rs1,300, and for large trucks from Rs1,270 to Rs1,500. For the Lahore-Abdul Hakeem Motorway (M-3), the toll tax for cars has been raised from Rs350 to Rs500, for wagons from Rs570 to Rs750, for 13 to 24 seat buses from Rs850 to Rs1,150, for buses from Rs1,200 to Rs1,500, for 2 to 3 axle trucks from Rs1,500 to Rs2,100, and for large trucks from Rs1,910 to Rs2,500. On the M-5—Multan to Sukkur—Motorway, the toll tax for cars has been raised from Rs680 to Rs900, for wagons from Rs980 to Rs1,300, for 13 to 24 seat coaches from Rs1,450 to Rs1,900, for buses from Rs2,060 to Rs2,600, for 2 to 3 axle trucks from Rs2,670 to Rs3,500, and for large trucks from Rs3,290 to Rs4,500. Additionally, the toll tax on the E-35 Hassanabdal-Havelian-Mansehra Expressway has also been increased. The toll tax for cars on E-35 has been raised from Rs130 to Rs180, for wagons from Rs210 to Rs280, for 13 to 24 seat coaches from Rs300 to Rs400, for buses from Rs430 to Rs560, for 2 to 3 axle trucks from Rs560 to Rs750, and for large trailers from Rs680 to Rs900. Meanwhile, the Transporters have rejected the hike in toll tax, terming it “unacceptable” and “cruel”. The Supreme Council of All Pakistan Transporters, in a statement, said that they are already struggling to cope with the high costs of diesel, spare parts, and tires, and the additional burden of increased toll tax will cause them immense hardship. “The hike in toll tax will not only affected goods transporters but also oil tankers, public transport, interstate buses, local vans, and wagon owners, who are all facing financial difficulties,” it added. “This increase in toll tax is a cruel decision that will further burden the already struggling transport industry,” said the council. “We urge the government to reconsider its decision and provide relief to the transporters.”",

        "content": "Home | News | Telangana Rythu Bharosa May Turn Tricky Telangana: Rythu Bharosa may turn tricky Govt to insist on affidavit for tenant farmers By D.Chandrabhaskar Rao Published Date - 27 May 2024, 11:38 PM Hyderabad: The State government’s moves to insist on an affidavit in support of the land let out by pattedars to tenant farmers for extending crop investment support to the latter is raising serious concerns. It is feared that the affidavit-based consideration for benefits under Rythu Bharosa , the Congress-tweaked version of the highly successful Rythu Bandhu , could build a conflict between land owners and tenant farmers. As a consequence of this, the tenants could find themselves at the receiving end. A State-wide exercise is expected to be taken to identify tenant farmers soon. Their number could be anywhere between 17 lakh to 22 lakh in Telangana, as it varies by crop season. It is an acknowledged fact that almost every third farmer is a tenant farmer in the State. There is no blueprint finalised yet to categorise who the tenant farmer is and who would merit the crop investment support in the event of extending it to the tenants too. It was already indicated that an affidavit would be mandatory for considering the eligibility of the tenant farmers for the monetary support under the Rythu Bharosa scheme sought to be implemented from the Kharif season this year. If the affidavit is made the sole criterion for extending the benefit to the tenant farmers, they could end up losing not only the benefit but even the land being enjoyed by them on lease. Nearly 90 percent of the land leases are entertained on goodwill, and are unofficial, officials said. The farmers would not come forward to give any sort of documented official commitment in support of their land that is let out to the tenants. This would give scope for litigation, as it happened in the undivided State before 2014, officials say, pointing out that it may even pave the way for the revival of the cultivator’s column in the ‘pahani’ and revenue records once again. In view of the growing litigation and conflict situation between the landowners and tenants, the cultivators’ column was done away with during the previous BRS regime. Otherwise, farmers used to opt for plantation of species such as Subabul and Eucalyptus, though they were not environment-friendly, in their lands as they required minimal involvement of labour, instead of giving land on lease to others. This was the practice of big farmers for a long time in areas such as Madhira and Annapureddipally in Khammam district. They started giving land on lease only after the cultivator columns were removed in the pahanis. If the column is restored, there is enough scope for all lease deals being annulled within no time. In a move to wean away farmers from the BRS, which nurtured the farming community so well and so long, the Congress leadership had promised enhanced crop investment assistance of Rs.15000 per acre before the Assembly elections. It also promised the benefit to both the landholding farmers as well as tenant farmers. Though it is a welcome move, the implementation should be based on a full-fledged system that would be enjoying statutory support, felt a retired IAS officer who sought anonymity. Otherwise, he said, it could revive the situation of the 1950s and 60s when landowners were at loggerheads with tenants because of protracted litigations.

        "content": "In celebration of Al-Zour Refinery’s opening KUWAIT: Burgan Bank recently lit up its headquarters in blue from May 25 to June 6, joining numerous public and private entities in the nationwide celebration of Al-Zour Refinery’s opening on May 29 under the patronage of HH the Amir of Kuwait Mishal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah. In addition to being the world’s largest grassroots refinery, Kuwait Integrated Petroleum Industries Company’s (KIPIC) mega project marks a turning point for Kuwait’s economy and its capacity for influencing the global oil and gas industry. Commenting on the Bank’s participation in the nationwide celebrations, Hessa Hussain Al-Najadah, Senior Manager - Corporate and CSR Communications at Burgan Bank, said: “The opening of Al-Zour Refinery is a win for Kuwait’s economy and all of its respective industries. In celebration of this national milestone, we are very proud to be among many institutions in Kuwait that are lighting up their buildings in blue, which symbolizes energy. This unified act showcases the continuous support and importance of positive economic and social change in our community. As we stand at the forefront of the domestic banking and financial market, it is not hard to foresee the resounding positive impact that Al-Zour Refinery will have on our domestic economy and the overall development of our industry.” Al-Najadah also underscored the importance of mega national projects such as Al-Zour Refinery, which resonate with Burgan’s unwavering commitment to the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles. In addition to providing over 1,000 job opportunities for Kuwaiti nationals, the refinery integrates stringent green features and state-of-the-art technologies that minimize possible harm to people or the environment. These efforts include recycling and reusing wastewater, controlling emissions, monitoring the ambient air, and using smoke-free and low-noise flares. As an engaged corporate entity, Burgan Bank remains committed to encouraging and supporting all social and economic efforts that contribute to the overall development of Kuwait’s economy and propel the country toward achieving its ambitious 2035 vision.",

The difference.\" honored Grayson Murray in his speech after winning . That challenge was just a piece of the statement Higgs sent. It was a moment in time that made someone stand still and listen. He did not have to go that route but chose to. “We lost, yesterday morning, one of our own,” Higgs said. “I don’t know if you guys heard the news, but somebody who went through a lot of difficult things, somebody that was open and honest about it... I thought about this moment and how to maybe remember Grayson. This golf stuff and the result, it’s lovely, sure, but it’s not that meaningful.” Higgs acknowledges that while he does not suffer from mental battles, he recognizes those that do. The 32-year-old has not played his best in recent years. He had to go back and play Q-school last year. The former SMU golfer knows how challenging this sport is and how hard this world makes things for people. “Lord knows how many people do, and it’s only ever increasing, so if we can — Everybody here could make a difference. The difference,” Higgs said. “Brighten up somebody’s day — it could mean the world.” After the trophy ceremony, Higgs continued to explain why he made the tribute to Murray. As a professional golfer, he knows all too well how terrible people can be on and off the internet. Higgs is one of the most humble individuals. He usually keeps things light and fun. The Dallas resident claims he is not the influential type, but his words suggest otherwise. “It’s OK to not be OK — to reach out,” he said. “The world’s tough, man. Social media is awesome but also a pain in the you-know-what. People can be mean. I’m mean sometimes, too. I’m certainly not perfect, but I’m going to certainly try to live what I said.” “That will be part of my routine, part of the things that I can control outside the golf course and hopefully bring light to somebody that may be having a hard time. Hopefully, make a difference in a few people’s lives over the course of however many years I have left on this crazy planet.”",

        "description": "According to NATO, Canada ranks only ahead of Spain, Belgium and Luxembourg on defence spending",
        "content": "OTTAWA — The Liberal government’s new defence policy has landed with a resounding thud in Washington and it could be a sign that U.S. politicians are losing patience with Canada’s stinginess on defence spending, analysts say. A letter released Thursday by 23 Democrat, Republican and independent United States senators took Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to task for Canada’s defence spending, demanding that Canada meet NATO benchmarks requiring members to commit at least two per cent of their GDP to defence spending. Vice-Admiral Mark Norman, Canada’s former vice-chief of defence staff and head of the Royal Canadian Navy, told National Post that Canada has not only been shirking its responsibility to our allies for decades, but woefully taking advantage of what he described as generously charitable levels of patience from the U.S. “The current government are the ones trying to manage this problem, but this problem did not happen in the last eight years — this has been decades in the making,” he said. “We don’t take defence and security seriously, and this is a manifestation of that lack of seriousness.” The letter from the U.S. senators argues that the geopolitical situation has gotten more dangerous and will require historic levels of investment in alliances like NATO. “As a founding member of NATO, Canada is a valued ally and has long contributed to essential NATO operations around the world,” reads the letter. “However, the transatlantic Alliance now faces one of the most severe threat landscapes in its history. As a consequence, we call on all NATO allies, including Canada, to uphold their commitment to ensure a stronger, sustainable NATO by accelerating efforts to reach the two per cent defence spending target set by the alliance .” Canada has consistently fallen short of this two per cent benchmark. According to numbers released earlier this year by NATO , Canada’s 1.33 per cent ranks only ahead of Spain, Belgium and Luxembourg. Eleven NATO members — Poland, the United States, Greece, Estonia, Lithuania, Finland, Latvia, the U.K., Hungary, Slovak Republic and Denmark — all met or exceeded the two per cent benchmark. “By the end of 2024, 18 NATO countries will meet the alliance’s goal to ensure NATO’s continued military readiness,” read the letter from U.S. senators. “This is a historic investment in our collective security, led by NATO allies like Poland, a country that has already exceeded three per cent of its GDP for defence spending.” Defence analyst Richard Shimooka said the letter suggests Canada’s attempt to sell their new defence policy to American officials earlier this month clearly didn’t resonate. “This letter coming after (Defence Minister Bill) Blair’s visit (to Washington) is a pretty good indication that they heard what they saw and said ‘nah, not good enough’,” he said. Invitations for comment to the PMO were redirected to the office of Blair, who referred National Post to remarks made by the minister on Thursday — a little over a week after he returned from a two-day visit to Washington, D.C. to sell Canada’s new defence policy. “We are very significantly increasing defence spending in Canada. In fact, our defence budget will go up 27 per cent, next year over this year,” Blair told reporters. “We recently came up with a defence policy that I think applies a very significant and necessary focus on continental defence, which I would share with the concerned senators.” Blair, however, gave no timeline on when Canada would meet the two per cent benchmark, adding the government knows they’ve got “work to do.” Canada unveiled its new defence strategy, Our North, Strong and Free , earlier this year, featuring $8.1 billion in new defence spending over five years. That plan projects defence spending to reach 1.76 per cent by 2029-30, still below NATO’s benchmark. Every dollar that Canada doesn’t spend on defence is one that can be spent on other pressing priorities, Norman said. “That may be extremely attractive to the Canadian government and Canadian voters, but we’ve been funding a lot of our own domestic national priorities thanks to the benevolence, charity and generosity of the United States, who basically have been carrying the vast majority of the defence and security obligations that we should have been contributing more to,” he said. Among the more vocal critics of Canada’s defence spending was former U.S. President Donald Trump, who famously called Trudeau “two-faced” in 2019 over Ottawa’s failures to meet the two per cent benchmark. Shimooka doubts there’s much appetite to increase defence spending — despite the very real possibility of another Trump presidency. “He practices grievance-based politics,” Shimooka said of Trump, who talks frequently of pulling the U.S. out of NATO. “So what’s the grievance with Canada right now? Defence.” Shimooka noted 10 of the letter’s signatories were Republican senators, demonstrating Washington’s concerns are a cross-party issue. “If it’s a widespread view within the U.S. senate and house that Canada is a laggard in spending and they’re not happy with it, you know that this will become a bilateral issue because Trump will look for a grievance to pick at, and this is an easy one,” he said. Maintaining a good relationship with Washington, especially one that could see a change of administration later this year, is absolutely critical for Canada, Norman said. “Our relationship with Washington is absolutely essential, not only to our security, but to our economic stability, and it affects more broadly some of the key relationships we have in Europe, Asia and elsewhere,” he said. “We need to get our act together.” National Post bpassifiume@postmedia.com Our website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.

        "description": "Antiques Roadshow expert Ken Farmer was left stunned when a guest brought in a large portrait of her fifth great-grand uncle - a sea captain who was believed to be the 'youngest sea captain in the New England area'",
        "content": "An Antiques Roadshow guest shared a chilling tale about her family's \"haunted\" painting. Expert Ken Farmer was presented with a grand portrait of Aaron Delano, the fifth great-grand uncle of the elderly guest. The woman explained that the painting had been passed down through generations, from her grandmother to her parents and then to her. She said: \"We believe that he is, through both research and word of mouth, that he was the youngest sea captain in the New England area. He was born in 1767 and unfortunately, he passed away, lost at sea in 1794.\" She further detailed that during his lifetime, it was believed Delano was trading along the New England coast, journeying from Plymouth and Nantucket to somewhere in Nova Scotia. Then, the guest revealed the eerie side of the painting. \"Over the years, we have decided as a family that he's probably haunted\", she confessed. \"When I was a teenager in my home, when my parents got him, they'd hang him in the front stairway and I would swear that I could hear him open and close the front door, walk up the stairs and walk down the hall. 13 Best wedding guest dresses for summer 2024 under £100 from River Island, Mango, M&S and more Antiques Roadshow guest's tragic story of ‘haunted’ portrait worth a fortune ( Image: PBR) \"And I would think that it was my father or my mother coming home and I'd go out and there was no one there. My older sister also experienced the walking sound in the hallway. When I was taking the picture down to bring it here, my husband was helping me.\" He was on the ladder and all of a sudden, the ladder slipped and went: 'Oh! First thing he said was: 'Oh Aaron'\". Antiques Roadshow expert Ken Farmer had some interesting observations: \"It's as much an illustration of his occupation as anything else. But he's very handsome, he's young. I love his face and the way that's painted and I love the patterned cloth on his vest. There, he's using the tools of his trade. That looks like a map and that instrument is an octant which means that it would do an eighth of a circle.\" He noted that it was a bit unique for an oil painting to be behind glass but was certain that she had \"something that's very extraordinary in terms of what appeals to people who collect Americana and folk art\". Farmer went on: \"We don't know who the artist is, because lots of times, these artists were itinerant, and we don't know who a lot of them were. Just in the condition that it's in right now, it's got paint loss, if you look right here, I think there's actually some film on the glass. But most importantly, there's no loss in his face or in the instruments, and the detail of the painting that I think really makes it valuable. And so after much conversation at the folk art table, we feel like at an auction, in as-is condition, its value would be £7,000 to £8,000.\" Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .",

        "content": "Aligning with the position of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a coalition of civil society groups, the Conference of Civil Societies (CCS), has warned that the proposed amendments to the extant Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Act will weaken the Bank and its autonomy. The group therefore urged the National Assembly to resist the attempt to deliberately weaken the CBN, adding that attempting to take away the bank’s autonomy under any guise would be tantamount to throwing spanners into the effective management of the economy. Addressing newsmen on Monday in Abuja on the economy and monetary policy, the Chairperson, Conference of Civil Societies, Adams Otakwu, expressed concern about the Nigerian economy, monetary policy, and its impact on ordinary Nigerians ahead of the forthcoming anniversary of the current administration. He noted that Nigerians are desirous of having in place a vibrant economy supported by an independent central bank. He urged the government to focus on fixing the economy and not create confusion by amending sections of the CBN Act that might weaken the institution. He said, “Nigerians in the past year have had great expectations concerning a major turn-around in the economy. Particularly of interest is the rate of inflation, which has continued to rise. Only last week, the Central Bank of Nigeria increased its monetary policy rate to 26.25% to check inflation, which now stands at 33.69%. “While we, as civil society groups, continue to engage the CBN and the fiscal authorities to improve the fortunes of the economy, we are of the view that having an independent central bank in place will help to put inflation under check. “This is why we would like to sound a note of caution ahead of the proposed amendment to the CBN Act by the National Assembly, which we consider ill-timed. “Without prejudice to the proceedings of the public hearing at the National Assembly, which we shall be part of on Thursday, May 30, 2024, we, in a rare move, align with the position of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that many of the proposed amendments to the extant CBN Act will weaken the Bank as its autonomy will be severely threatened. “Studies worldwide show a direct correlation between independent central banks and adequate checks on inflation. We, therefore, urge the NASS to resist the attempt to deliberately weaken the CBN. Attempting to take away the bank’s autonomy under any guise would be tantamount to throwing spanners into the effective management of the economy. “In a few days, the current administration will be a year in office. We should focus on fixing the economy, not creating confusion by amending sections of the CBN Act that might weaken the institution. Now is not the time to push for an amendment to the CBN Act. “Our advice is that an amendment to the CBN Act, if any, should wait and be well thought out. The present Act contains enough checks that the National Assembly can trigger if it so wishes.” Otakwu appealed to the media “to continue to flag issues around exchange rate pressures, rising input prices, and security that still challenge the economy in your reports, thereby putting pressure on the fiscal and monetary authorities to play their constitutional roles in managing the economy.” ALSO READ THESE TOP STORIES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE",

        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread by Anne Wennberg, University of Oslo An international meta study reveals that there may be less of certain mold toxins in organically grown grain, compared to grain grown in the conventional manner. This, and other findings from research into agricultural products, can have major consequences. \"Up until now, the general assumption has been that grain grown using organic methods is more contaminated with mold toxins than grain grown in the conventional way and contaminated grain can pose a health risk to humans. \"An extensive meta analysis published in Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety , demonstrates the opposite,\" says professor Per Ole Iversen. He is one of two scientists from the Department of Nutrition at UiO who participated in the study. Carlo Leifert, professor of organic agriculture and currently a guest professor at the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, also both initiated and participated in the study. Iversen is the representative of human medicine in the research group and believes that the study is greatly strengthened by being interdisciplinary. \"The meta study we have just published makes it clear that organic methods of cultivation do not lead to a higher incidence of mold in crops than conventionally grown grain, and to some extent, the opposite is the case: for two types of mold, there was no difference.\" In addition, the study has also revealed a number of advantages linked to organic cultivation. \"Research into organically grown foods has been carried out for many years and many people believe that this type of cultivation is good for both livestock and farmers—and for human health—but we were not quite sure about the latter. \"Now it looks as if organically grown fruit and vegetables have a more favorable content of antioxidants and micronutrients than agricultural products produced in the conventional way, and this can be good for both you and me,\" says Iversen. Iversen believes that the study will have major consequences. \"The myth that organic cultivation has a higher risk of being affected by mold has now been largely refuted. In any case, it should not weaken the message that organic food production is to be recommended,\" says Iversen, adding that these findings are very surprising and have weight, since they are based on a large number of well documented findings from different parts of the world. Iversen and his colleagues have previously conducted a randomized, clinical study among university students , where they also found that organically grown food is advantageous compared to agricultural products cultivated in the normal way. \"We are currently carrying out a new randomized study, which examines two groups of pregnant women : one group is eating organic food while the other is eating ordinary food during pregnancy. We will then carry out a thorough study of the effect of the organic food intake on both mothers and babies for two years following each baby's birth,\" he explains. Per Ole Iversen played two roles in the extensive meta study. \"I participated in the selection of the studies to be included. In addition, I contributed with reflections from a doctor's point of view on what kind of consequences the study could have for the health of ordinary people.\" More information: Juan Wang et al, Mycotoxin contamination in organic and conventional cereal grain and products: A systematic literature review and meta‐analysis, Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety (2024).

        "content": "The equestrian sporting community is mourning one of its own. Georgie Campbell died after falling from her horse during a competition at the Bicton International Horse Trials in southwest England on May 26. She was 37. \"Medical professionals attended immediately following her fall at fence 5b however, unfortunately, she could not be saved,\" British Eventing, the sport's national governing body in the UK, said in a statement the same day. \"The horse, Global Quest, was assessed by the on-site vets and walked back to the stable and is uninjured. The organization concluded the announcement, \"To respect the family's privacy at this extremely difficult and sad time, no further details will be shared.\" Georgie was a decorated rider and competed in more than 200 events, the BBC reported. Her husband Jessie Campbell is also a fellow event rider, who competed for New Zealand at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The couple came together to form Team Campbell Eventing . They highlighted their riding career on the joint Instagram with videos, photos and updates from competitions. Less than three weeks before the incident, they posted a video of her practicing with Global Quest. The May 5 caption said with a starstruck emoji, \"Global Quest at his Best.\" Georgie has also praised the horse for other rides. In October, she shared several pictures of the 11-year-old animal, writing, \"Brilliant week with Global Quest doing what he does best—flying round the XC giving me a class ride.\" \"After picking up an injury at the start of the year and needing some quiet time we lacked a bit of match practice which showed in the dressage and [showjumping],\" she explained, \"but it was so great having him back feeling so fit and well.\"",

        "content": "Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State has paid the sum of N147 million as counterparts fund for the Livelihood Improvement Family Enterprises Project for the Niger Delta (LIFE-ND). LIFE-ND is being funded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)in collaboration with the Federal government and the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC The LIFE-ND, directly supports Nigeria’s agricultural policy and the strategic framework for youth employment and job creation. The Project is being implemented currently in the following Niger-Delta States of Abia, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo and Ondo. The State Project Coordinator, Mr John Omoruyi who made the disclosure in a statement on Monday in Benin, said the ₦147 million payment covered 2022, 2023 and 2024 counterpart funds. Omoruyi said the payment cover three years counterpart fund for the project meant to create wealth, sustainable job, and ensure food security in the participating states. Omoruyi said” the governor has been commended by the National Project Coordinator (NPC), LIFE-ND, Engr Sanni Abiodun for the prompt payment. “This is in line with the consistent desire of the federal and state governments of Nigeria and IFAD, to attain sustainable job and wealth creation as well as ensure food security in Nigeria,” he stated. He stated that Obaseki was the first governor in the country to pay its counterpart fund up to date. According to the statement, Abiodun urged other participating States to emulate Edo state Governor in this regard. Omoruyi also said that the payment of N147 million counterpart funds to LIFE-ND would enable the state access funds for the ongoing transformation of rural economy via agribusiness. “Gov. Obaseki has done well to restate his commitment to sustainable development of the agricultural sector by promoting modern farming techniques, supporting smallholders farmers, encouraging value addition and fostering agribusiness innovations. “Furthermore, this feat by the Obaseki administration will not only contribute to economic growth but also enhace food security, reduce poverty and empower rural communities in Edo State. “This is in addition to boosting agricultural productivity and value addition across four commodities’ rice, cassava, poultry and Fishery value chains,” he said. According to Omoruyi, LIFE-ND as of today in Edo State, has created jobs for 2,348 women and youth enterprises out of the targeted 4,250 across the participating ten local government areas and 100 communities across the State. He said the release of this counterpart fund by the Governor, will further create employment for over 2,500 women and youths targeted for year 2024.",

        "description": "The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum is under the spotlight again after a manager failed to consult a collections committee before purchasing a 21-star flag, supposedly from 1818 when Illinois became the 21st state to join the Union.",
        "content": "The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum is once again under the spotlight after a manager failed to consult a collections committee before purchasing a 21-star flag whose description as a rare banner marking Illinois' 1818 admission to the Union is disputed. The flag's acquisition through an online auction for more than $15,000 precipitated an investigation by Illinois' Office of the Executive Inspector General about money used for the purchase. The purchase also led to division in the Springfield museum's leadership and may have prompted the firing of an employee who said the acquisition skirted procedures. The flag, measuring 7-foot-5 by 6-foot-5, is known as a \"Grand Luminary\" because its 21 stars are arranged in the shape of a star. The museum is confident it represents Illinois' admission as the 21st state, spokesperson Christopher Wills said. Such flags are rare because the design was changed a year later when Alabama and Maine joined the Union. But Jeff Bridgman, a respected vexillologist, or flag expert, told The Associated Press its construction and materials indicate the flag was produced decades later, during the Civil War, and is perhaps a Southern exclusionary flag whose stars represent states that remained loyal to the Union. Bridgman, who stocks roughly 3,000 mostly 19th-century flags, says it is not from 1818. \"If it was,\" he said, \"I would have been after it at the auction.\" This is not the first possible blow to the museum's credibility. Its prized purchase of a purported Lincoln stovepipe hat appraised at $6.5 million went sour when evidence linking it to the 16th president was questioned. A director was fired in 2019 for sending without approval a copy of the Gettysburg Address, written in Lincoln's hand, to a Texas exhibit operated by conservative political commentator Glenn Beck. The museum's acquisitions chief, Ian Hunt, submitted a request to the executive director to pursue the 21-star flag on Nov. 6 , according to documents provided to the AP under an open-records request. The flag had been part of the prestigious Zaricor Flag Collection . Hunt won the auction on Nov. 13 and the museum paid $15,625 for the flag using the King Hostick trust fund , an endowment to finance state historic research and artifact acquisition. Museum policy dictates that purchases exceeding $2,000 be proposed for advance consideration by a collections committee composed of department heads. The panel hadn't met regularly because of a staff vacancy, but it convened to consider the flag on Dec. 7, three weeks after its purchase, and voted 7-2 in favor. Then-registrar Eldon Yeakel and research director Brian Mitchell voted \"no.\" Mitchell declined to comment to the AP. Staff comments at the bottom of the document recording the vote include concerns about the flag's authenticity and storage. The committee vote would have been closer had the acquisition not been a done deal, Yeakel said. The museum fired Yeakel May 6, citing his poor performance and rules violations, but he blamed his \"no\" vote. Wills declined comment. Yeakel said he told investigators with the Executive Inspector General that the flag purchase improperly sidestepped committee concurrence. They asked him if he knew of fraud or abuse in the transaction and whether King Hostick funds were tapped. He told them he didn't know of any fraud or abuse or the details concerning Hostick money or its intended use. Two museum employees, one current and one former, told the AP that their complaints to the inspector prompted the investigation. They requested anonymity for fear of retribution. Neil Olson, general counsel for the inspector general, declined comment on the probe. The office has not released any findings. In cases of wrongdoing, the inspector general's office can recommend corrective remedies, including discipline or dismissal. The inspector also may conduct a criminal investigation or refer a probe to the appropriate law enforcement agency. Wills said the museum has not been made aware of any complaints to the inspector general but was \"clearly allowed\" to use Hostick money for the flag. He conceded a \"misstep\" by Hunt for proceeding without committee consideration but noted museum policy only requires the committee's \"recommendation\" on pricey purchases. After the late Ben Zaricor purchased the flag in 1995, he had renowned vexillologist Howard Madaus examine it. Madaus determined the flag was made entirely of cotton in 1818-20. Bridgman considered Madaus, who died in 2007, a respected colleague and friend, but he said Madaus got this one wrong. While he hasn't examined the flag personally, Bridgman said high-resolution images show the blue canton is wool or a wool blend, typical of Civil War-era flags. It is worn in long, narrow holes. \"Cotton doesn't do that. Wool absolutely does,\" Bridgman said. A 2003 report by respected conservator Fonda Thomsen determined at least part of the flag is made of wool but \"the flag was not examined sufficiently to draw any conclusions.\" Museum officials have not yet inspected the flag, which was delivered to a conservation company for stabilization and cleaning to ensure its longevity. The estimated cost of conservation is $18,000. The AP asked other vexillologists to examine photos of the flag and judge its age. Only one responded. Dave Martucci of Washington, Maine, said via email that he is familiar with the flag and believes the \"design, construction and size\" point toward 1818, not 1861. Regardless of its history, Wills said the flag has \"a solid pedigree\" and was a sound investment. \"We're always open to learning more about it,\" Wills said. \"And if it turns out that it's from a different era with a different story, that's the way it goes. We'll tell that story. And it just so happens that that story is a good one, too.\"",

        "description": "The Town started construction on May 6 and will work on the west side of the road until winter.",
        "content": "A project rendering shows a new sidewalk design in downtown Brunswick. The town began construction for the Maine Street project on May 6 and will work on the west side of the road until winter. The construction on the east side of the street is projected to start next spring. Courtesy of Town of Brunswick Brunswick broke ground this month on a complete overhaul of its Maine Street sidewalks as the summer tourist season looms. The project has some downtown business owners worried about how the construction will affect foot traffic during the key season. The construction, which officially started May 6 and will last until crews pause work for the winter, has been several years in the making and aims to replace 5,000 square yards of 40-year-old pathways lining Maine Street. The new design will improve accessibility and add bike racks, benches, plants and new trees to the state road, according to the town. With tourist season pressing closer, town officials are encouraging people who pass through or live in Brunswick to support local businesses as sidewalk construction limits parking and changes access points to some shops on Maine Street. “It is our primary goal to get the word out far and wide that our downtown businesses are open for business during the construction,” Interim Town Manager Julia Henze said. “We are encouraging our community residents and stakeholders to help support all the downtown businesses by making a concerted effort to buy local.” • April: The town removed some trees on the west side of Maine Street, with remaining trees being monitored by the town arborist for damage as the project continues. New trees will be planted after the project is finished, according to the town. • May through fall: Construction crews will move block-by-block to replace sidewalks, starting at The Great Impasta and working south towards Pleasant Street. Demolition is already complete between Mill Street and Gilman Avenue, according to the town website, which also stated that w ork on the Gilman to Lincoln block will start this week. • Winter: Construction pauses. • Next spring: Crews begin work on the east side of Maine Street. Last week, a group of downtown business owners met with town officials, construction crews and the Downtown Business Association to discuss concerns about how the construction could hinder foot traffic and business. Town Hall acknowledged in a news release that construction would be disruptive for shops and that it will work closely with BDA to increase shop promotion. A second rendering of the sidewalk construction shows a finished pathway on Maine Street. Courtesy of the Town of Brunswick “I am very encouraged by the construction progress and cooperation with the town and BDA,” said Toby Tarpinian, owner of Morning Glory Natural Foods on Maine Street. “If we all work together, I believe the end result will pay dividends.” The sidewalk setup this summer will involve designated pedestrian walkways, ramps and entry points in construction areas, according to Ian Messier, the chief engineer for Crooker Construction. Flaggers will help direct traffic and pedestrians through the area while crews work, he added. “Construction is progressing as quickly as possible and being done on a block-by-block basis to minimize disruption,” Messier said. The town said that as work continues, crews will use parking spaces in front of businesses — a decision that it said will save time and money on the project. To get around the limited number of parking spaces, the town encouraged workers and shoppers to find alternate parking off of Maine Street. It additionally suggested that people could walk, bike or ride a bus during construction. Parking spaces will be reopened for Bowdoin Alumni Weekend, the town said.

        "content": "Two months after Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed, cruise ships are now taking off from the Port of Baltimore. A Royal Caribbean ship called Vision of the Seas left from the port on Saturday for a trip to Bermuda. And a Carnival Cruise ship called Pride destined for Greenland and Canada left Baltimore on Sunday. The two trips are notable as the first cruise ships to leave Baltimore since the port was blocked by the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge on March 26. The bridge collapsed after being hit by a cargo ship, killing six workers. The Francis Scott Key Bridge services about 30,000 people a day. \"We've been working through this process for the past two months,\" Jonathan Daniels, the director for the Port of Baltimore said in a video posted to X on May 25 by the port. One week ago, the port's terminal was the headquarters for the recovery operations for the Francis Scott Key Bridge, Daniels added. The terminal is also a massive area of tourism for Maryland, bringing in 440,000 cruise passengers a year, Daniels told the Baltimore Sun. The project to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge will take four years and is estimated to cost between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion, a spokesperson for the Maryland Department of Transportation said in May 2023.",

        "content": "One of the most gregarious and beloved players in NBA history has died at the age of 71. Two-time NBA champion and Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer Bill Walton died on Monday, the NBA announced in a news release. The following has been released by the NBA. — NBA Communications (@NBAPR) According to the release, Walton was surrounded by his family. The former UCLA star died after a “prolonged battle with cancer,” it said. “Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. “As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position.” Indeed, while modern players such as the Denver Nuggets’ may have normalized the idea of centers who have the passing ability of a point guard, Walton was an absolute anomaly for his day. His passing was the crux of his very unique skill set. Silver continued, “His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams.” Walton won two NCAA championships as a member of John Wooden’s Bruins. UCLA mourns the passing of two-time NCAA champion Bill Walton, a Naismith Hall of Fame inductee (1993) and charter member of the Hall of Fame (1984). IN MEMORIAM: — UCLA Men’s Basketball (@UCLAMBB) His two NBA championships came in vastly different roles. The 1977 Portland Trailblazers won a championship with Walton as the focal point and star of the team. The 1986 Boston Celtics — considered by some to be the greatest professional basketball team of all time — brought an older and injury-riddled Walton off the bench for effective backup minutes. Injuries plagued Walton’s career until the bitter end, but the 6-foot-11 center soon found another venture in which he would fall in love: broadcasting. Silver said he “translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball.” “But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” the commissioner said. “He was a regular presence at league events – always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” In a testament to how generally beloved Bill Walton is and was, the generally toxic landscape of NBA chatter on X was all unified in mourning over the loss. Massive loss. All time great that appreciated every era of basketball and didnt tear Any player down. Very smart basketball mind. He will be missed — Richard 🐐 (@pbp_Rich) RIP to the greatest Blazer of all time — President Curry. (@Curry4daW) Rest on Legend 🕊️❤️ — DC🥤 (@DCWale_CFC) Walton is survived by his wife, Lori, and his four sons, Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke.

        "content": "Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson's daughters Princess Beatrice and Eugenie have got all the spotlight amid Prince William and Prince Harry's rift dram as the royal sisters enjoy strong bonds with their feuding cousins. The Duke of York, who has no place in King Charles' monarchy due to his scandals, seems to be delighted to see the importance of his daughters in the royal family. Beatrice and Eugenie made headlines as they put on a united front at Prince William's party at Buckingham Palace. Disgraced royal Andrew celebrated the move by riding a horse at Windsor estate day after the event, looking happy and relaxed. The royal sisters attracted spot light for a good reason as they stood by the Firm at their difficult time, seemingly sending a message to Harry to end the feud with his elder brother and members of the royal family. They teamed up with the future King after saying no to Harry's invite for his Invictus Games service in London earlier this month. Beatrice and Eugenie, ninth and eleventh in line to the throne, did not attend Harry's milestone because that could have been a sign of a split in the royal family, There were speculation that Kate and William were hugely worried about a potential alliance between Beatrice, Eugenie and the Sussexes. Beatrice and Eugenie's move not only brought smile to their father but also helped William and Kate to get rid of the tension about their alleged alliance with Harry and Meghan. Some royal experts and historians believe Beatrice and Eugenie could play major roles in the royal family, given the the fact that the senior royals’ main asset Kate is effectively out of action as she continues her treatment for cancer. Princess Eugenie even issued a statement to highlight the importance of \"supporting family\" after she teamed up with the future King as she wrote: \"Come rain or shine, I was delighted to support my family yesterday to meet some special individuals at the Buckingham Palace Garden Party who have gone above and beyond to support their local communities and the country.\"",

        "content": "Nigeria’s largest container terminal, APM Terminals Apapa has embarked on an awareness campaign on the standard gauge rail line with a rail trip to Ibadan for its customers. About 20 of its customers comprising of importers and exporters, were present on the trip which began from Ebute Metta rail station, Lagos, ending at the Moniya Freight Yard, Ibadan. Last year, the terminal began the evacuation of cargo via the standard gauge rail line from the Lagos Port Complex Apapa to Moniya Freight Yard in Ibadan, Oyo State, to boost the handling of exports and imports. Speaking on the trip, undertaken to create awareness on the opportunities the standard rail gauge offers for the economy and ease for the customers, the APM Terminals Nigeria Inland Sales Manager, David Abbey underscored the critical role of rail in facilitating trade. He said APM Terminals’s vision of “improving life for all by integrating the world’” is one of the many reasons this product was created which gives the customers the option of rail, road and barging of containers out of APM Terminals Apapa. “The rail runs from APM Terminals Apapa to Moniya in Ibadan which connects nicely to the North. “The standard gauge rail line will guarantee safety, faster turnaround time for cargo exchange, create reliability, predictability and ease of doing business for our valued customers, in addition to creating a one-stop shop for import, storage and export consolidation through container freight station (CFS) operations at the rail terminal in Moniya Ibadan,” David said. On his part, Market and Commercial Intelligence Manager for APM Terminals Nigeria, Adetunji Igbaugba, encouraged importers and exporters to use the standard gauge rail line for fast delivery of their containers to and from Ibadan. He said the Moniya Freight Yard has 8,000 square metres of land and a warehouse measuring about 4,000 square metres which can be used for stuffing and unstuffing of boxes. “We do a lot of exports in Moniya. However, we need to continue to improve on the processes to ensure that we surpass our customers’ expectation like scheduling and reliability. We will continue to partner with the Nigerian Railway Corporation and other stakeholders to bring the needed efficiency for the customers to have a better trust in the product and service,” he said. The Executive Director, Bueno Logistics Limited, Jedson Nwankwo said the Moniya Freight Yard, consisting of two terminals (A and B), is well positioned to handle many containers. He said Terminal A is operated by Diamond Star and Terminal B operated by Bueno Logistics. Also speaking, Director of Primlaks Nigeria Ltd – Logistics Division, Bhagu Vasnani expressed appreciation to APM Terminals for the rail trip and assured of cooperation to optimize the use of the standard gauge rail line and the Moniya Freight Yard. Other exporters who were part of the trip also commended APM Terminals for the initiative.

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ‘Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.”",

READ: K-Electric warns of power cut to Sindh govt over unpaid dues Earlier, the rising temperature and prolonged power outages in different areas of Karachi made the lives of the city’s residents miserable, ARY News reported on Friday. It has been more than 12 hours since Karachi’s Garden West residents are witnessing a power outage as the electric supply has been suspended since 9 am. A resident claimed that the electricity provider for the metropolis cut off power to the area because several households in the neighborhood failed to pay their monthly power tariff bills. In a similar incident, the residents of Karachi’s Manghopir area staged a sit-in protest against electricity load-shedding. The protestors have set up a camp at the electric grid station, with many residents joining the protest. Despite several rounds of negotiations between protesters and the police, no resolution has been reached.",

After belting out lyrics at the crowded venue, she received a standing ovation from the audience. However, some social media users on X (formerly known as Twitter ) shared their thoughts on Kim and Kanye's daughter snagging a coveted role in the musical concert. One noted: 'Nepotism is literally the best thing to be born with,' while another added, 'The worst case of nepo I have witnessed.' Another penned, 'Nepotism and the synonym next to it is KARDASHIANS,' followed by laughing face emojis. 'Nepotism is so crazy lol,' one wrote.

'There's a kid out there with real talent that should've been given this opportunity. And no I'm not a hater I actually like the \"Kardashians.\"' It's unclear if North went through a standard audition process. DailyMail.com has reached out to a Kardashian spokesperson for comment. Earlier this month, it was announced that North was cast in the live-to-film concert event which ran for two nights on May 24 and May 25. The Hollywood Bowl can notably hold up to 17,500 people and tickets for the concert began at $60.

North's acting debut came after she announced her first album Elementary School Dropout in March, a nod to her dad's 2004 debut The College Dropout. The preteen was also featured on 'Talking / Once Again', from Vultures 1, Ye's collaborative album with Ty Dolla $ign.

        "content": "A joint delegation from the Nigeria Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) visited Gombe State on Monday for an investment promotion drive. Gombe State Governor, Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya, led members of the State Executive Council to receive the delegation at the Government House in Gombe. The delegation visited to seek collaboration with the Gombe State Government on the implementation of the UNDP-funded Nigerian Investment Certification Programme for States (NICPS), for which Gombe has been selected, along with Ekiti and Anambra states, for the pilot phase. While receiving the joint delegation, Inuwa Yahaya informed the guests of his administration’s sustained efforts in investment promotion since his assumption of office, citing the establishment of the sprawling 1,000-hectare Muhammadu Buhari Industrial Park and other reforms and initiatives as factors that continue to position Gombe as the best destination of choice for investors. He added that by creating an enabling business environment for all forms of investment in Gombe, the state earned the No. 1 ranking in Ease of Doing Business in Nigeria for two consecutive years by the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC). According to him, “We are delighted to receive this delegation from the NIPC, UNDP, and the presidency. This visit is timely, considering that it comes at a time when Gombe is actively seeking investors for the state. It is coming just a few months before the second edition of the Gombe State Investment Summit.” “I am proud to say that Gombe is always open to any partnership that could advance our investment drive. Since 2019, we have been making efforts to make Gombe the destination of choice for investors,” the governor said. The Governor added that “our desire to advance investment in the state led to the establishment of the 1,000-hectare Muhammadu Buhari Industrial Park, which has all the necessary infrastructure, including adequate energy for companies at the park. We have also introduced reforms and initiatives that helped us earn the PEBEC ranking as No. 1 in Ease of Doing Business in Nigeria for two consecutive years.” “We understand that investment will not come without creating a favourable climate, and this is what we have been doing and will continue to do, even if it means fostering more partnerships with entities that support us in this endeavour,” Inuwa Yahaya added. The Governor further assured the delegation of his full support for the implementation of the new initiative aimed at helping beneficiary states promote their investment potential to global investors. He stated that his administration will maintain a strong partnership with the NIPC, UNDP, and SDGs to boost Gombe’s investment drive while pledging to rally his colleagues at the Northern States Governors’ Forum, where he serves as Chairman, to join the initiative in order to collectively propel the economic prosperity of Northern Nigeria and the country at large. Addressing the State EXCO, the Executive Secretary/CEO of the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC), Ms Aisha Rimi, who led the delegation, informed Governor Inuwa Yahaya that the Nigerian Investment Certification Programme was introduced in late 2023 to support states in demonstrating their competence in providing information capable of attracting investments. She stated that, “Your Excellency, the partnership we seek with the Gombe State Government aims to strengthen the Gombe State Investment Promotion Agency by providing them the necessary capacity to promote, attract, and manage investments.” “This will ultimately enhance the overall ability to attract new investments and provide aftercare services to existing investors in Gombe State. We are proud to learn that Gombe has been making significant efforts to advance its investment drive, and we assure you of our support in achieving this goal,” she said. She commended Governor Inuwa Yahaya for the visionary idea of establishing the Industrial Park, noting that during their tour of the facility, they observed the necessary infrastructure for companies to operate there, which includes, among others, an administrative building that will house all relevant government agencies as it serves as a one-stop centre for the administrative and regulatory needs of potential investors. In her remarks, the representative of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Mrs Rose Kefas, informed Governor Inuwa Yahaya that Gombe State has been chosen to serve as the SDGs Donation Hub for the Northeast sub-region, attributing the choice to Governor Yahaya’s commitment to mainstreaming SDGs programmes in Gombe State. She added that, in recognition of Governor Inuwa Yahaya’s development efforts, the SDGs will present the Muhammadu Buhari Industrial Park at the SDGs Global Investment Forum next year in New York, United States, with the aim of showcasing the park’s capacity to global investors and attracting direct foreign investment into Gombe State. According to her, “Your Excellency, let me express my appreciation for all the support you have given to the SDGs programmes in Gombe State. Your commitment has made Gombe a shining light at the national level. We commend your efforts in advancing Gombe State.” “We are aware of the 10-Year Development Plan you have created, which is in line with our goals at the SDGs. Based on this, I am delighted to inform you that we have decided to present the Muhammadu Buhari Industrial Park at the SDGs Global Investment Forum next year in New York, United States. This will showcase its capacity to global investors and attract direct foreign investment to Gombe State,” she said. Also speaking, Fatima Umar, the representative of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), reiterated the UNDP’s commitment to supporting Gombe State in its investment promotion efforts, emphasising that the UNDP recognises the significant strides Gombe has made in creating a conducive environment for investment and is dedicated to providing ongoing assistance to further enhance these efforts. She further highlighted that the UNDP’s support would include capacity-building initiatives, technical assistance, and facilitating connections with potential local and international investors, all aimed at improving Gombe State’s economic growth and development.

        "content": "Kieran McKenna is set to stay at Ipswich and sign a new long-term contract after attracting interest from Manchester United, Chelsea and Brighton. The 38-year-old coach has guided Ipswich to back-to-back EFL promotions and a first Premier League campaign at Portman Road for 22 years, but there were question marks over whether he would remain at the club next season. Sky Sports News revealed McKenna was a candidate for the vacant Brighton job following Roberto De Zerbi's departure, while Man Utd officials met with representatives of the Ipswich boss . McKenna was also linked with replacing Mauricio Pochettino at Chelsea, but was told by phone on Sunday that the club were looking elsewhere. Sky Sports News also learned that Ipswich Town majority shareholder Ed Schwartz flew into the UK from the United States at the end of last week for talks with the club's chief executive officer Mark Ashton and McKenna. It is understood discussions were over a proposed new deal. And now the speculation around the Ipswich boss' future is set to end with McKenna poised to extend his stay at Portman Road in what would be a major boost for the newly-promoted club. Ipswich appointed McKenna in 2021, and in his first full season in charge he led Ipswich to promotion from League One to the Championship.

It was followed by a second consecutive promotion with Ipswich getting out of the Championship at the first attempt to reach the Premier League for the first time since 2002. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sky Sports' Adam Williams: On December 16, 2021 Ipswich confirmed 35-year-old Manchester United assistant manager McKenna had been appointed their new manager on a three-and-a-half year contract. \"Kieran who?\" was understandably the majority of the reaction beyond those who may not have been familiar with McKenna's work under Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick at Old Trafford alongside Michael Carrick. Softly spoken at first, but methodical, clear and honest in his media engagements, fans soon welcomed the departure from McKenna's more brash and at times, overbearing predecessors. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Promotion would prove too tough a task to achieve in the remainder of that season as Ipswich finished 11th but already McKenna had irons in the fire for his first full season in charge. Freddie Ladapo, Dom Ball and Leif Davis would be the notable summer signings and from the off, it was clear the race to win League One that season would be hotly contested. Plymouth set and maintained the pace throughout while Ipswich, Sheffield Wednesday and Barnsley tried to keep up. After slipping down to fourth on February 14 with a goalless draw at Bristol Rovers, thoughts were understandably turning to another season of disappointment with Town eight points adrift of the top two. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player But January's transfer window had already seen four key additions in George Hirst, Harry Clarke, Massimo Luongo and Nathan Broadhead. They would prove to be pivotal as Ipswich went on to win 13 of their 15 remaining league games, including eight in a row, to amass 98 points and automatic promotion back to the Championship after a four-year absence. It felt good to be back in the second tier and as this season began, many supporters were hoping to just win more games than they lost and use it as a chance to continue building on the good work of the previous 18 months. But 46 games later they are heading back to the top flight. A season of free-scoring, free-flowing, full-throttle football has seen both Ipswich's and McKenna's stock soar. Erik ten Hag will be replaced as Manchester United manager only if the club believe there is a better option out there. The final decision on Ten Hag’s future will be made during the season review United are carrying out now. Ten Hag is waiting for the outcome of the review but is convinced he is the best man for the job. He is confident United will perform much better in the league next season if he stays – especially if key players remain fit and the club sign a centre back, midfielder and striker.

        "content": "Kieran McKenna is set to stay at Ipswich and sign a new long-term contract after attracting interest from Manchester United, Chelsea and Brighton. The 38-year-old coach has guided Ipswich to back-to-back EFL promotions and a first Premier League campaign at Portman Road for 22 years, but there were question marks over whether he would remain at the club next season. Sky Sports News revealed McKenna was a candidate for the vacant Brighton job following Roberto De Zerbi's departure, while Man Utd officials met with representatives of the Ipswich boss . McKenna was also linked with replacing Mauricio Pochettino at Chelsea, but was told by phone on Sunday that the club were looking elsewhere. Sky Sports News also learned that Ipswich Town majority shareholder Ed Schwartz flew into the UK from the United States at the end of last week for talks with the club's chief executive officer Mark Ashton and McKenna. It is understood discussions were over a proposed new deal. And now the speculation around the Ipswich boss' future is set to end with McKenna poised to extend his stay at Portman Road in what would be a major boost for the newly-promoted club. Ipswich appointed McKenna in 2021, and in his first full season in charge he led Ipswich to promotion from League One to the Championship.

It was followed by a second consecutive promotion with Ipswich getting out of the Championship at the first attempt to reach the Premier League for the first time since 2002. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sky Sports' Adam Williams: On December 16, 2021 Ipswich confirmed 35-year-old Manchester United assistant manager McKenna had been appointed their new manager on a three-and-a-half year contract. \"Kieran who?\" was understandably the majority of the reaction beyond those who may not have been familiar with McKenna's work under Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick at Old Trafford alongside Michael Carrick. Softly spoken at first, but methodical, clear and honest in his media engagements, fans soon welcomed the departure from McKenna's more brash and at times, overbearing predecessors. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Promotion would prove too tough a task to achieve in the remainder of that season as Ipswich finished 11th but already McKenna had irons in the fire for his first full season in charge. Freddie Ladapo, Dom Ball and Leif Davis would be the notable summer signings and from the off, it was clear the race to win League One that season would be hotly contested. Plymouth set and maintained the pace throughout while Ipswich, Sheffield Wednesday and Barnsley tried to keep up. After slipping down to fourth on February 14 with a goalless draw at Bristol Rovers, thoughts were understandably turning to another season of disappointment with Town eight points adrift of the top two. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player But January's transfer window had already seen four key additions in George Hirst, Harry Clarke, Massimo Luongo and Nathan Broadhead. They would prove to be pivotal as Ipswich went on to win 13 of their 15 remaining league games, including eight in a row, to amass 98 points and automatic promotion back to the Championship after a four-year absence. It felt good to be back in the second tier and as this season began, many supporters were hoping to just win more games than they lost and use it as a chance to continue building on the good work of the previous 18 months. But 46 games later they are heading back to the top flight. A season of free-scoring, free-flowing, full-throttle football has seen both Ipswich's and McKenna's stock soar. Erik ten Hag will be replaced as Manchester United manager only if the club believe there is a better option out there. The final decision on Ten Hag’s future will be made during the season review United are carrying out now. Ten Hag is waiting for the outcome of the review but is convinced he is the best man for the job. He is confident United will perform much better in the league next season if he stays – especially if key players remain fit and the club sign a centre back, midfielder and striker.

        "content": "B.C. Place is going to turn into “Da Club” with U.S. rapper 50 Cent set to perform at a pre-game concert at the B.C. Lions’ home opener. The team announced Monday that 50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, will headline the Lions’ third annual concert kickoff on June 15 before its first home game of the season against the Calgary Stampeders. “It’s an honour to give our great fans the opportunity to see a world class performer who resonates across multiple generations of music lovers,” said Lions’ owner Amar Doman in a statement. “Concert Kickoff has become a great tradition in Vancouver and 50 Cent is our best one yet.” The Grammy- and Juno-award winning artist skyrocketed to fame in 2003 with his debut album Get Rich or Die Tryin’ and its massive hit In Da Club. The rapper was a guest performer in Super Bowl LVI halftime show in 2022 in Los Angeles, performing with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar in what was the first Super Bowl halftime show to feature entirely hip-hop music. The artist performed in Vancouver last year at a sold-out show at Rogers Arena as part of his Final Lap tour.

Place at 3 p.m. on June 15 before kickoff at 4 p.m. There will also be a backyard party at 10:30 a.m. with games, food and drinks, including $5 beers, at Terry Fox Plaza. It will be the Lions’ first game at their home arena, but their second game of the season. The team start their first game on the road against the Toronto Argonauts on June 9. Tickets for the concert kickoff start at $25 for adults and $17 for 17 and under. This is the third time the B.C. Lions are kicking off their season with a celebrity performer. Last year, LL Cool J drew large crowds to B.C. Place , while pop group OneRepublic kicked off the pre-game concert series in 2022, drawing more than 34,000 to the game, the largest crowd of the regular season for the CFL. chchan@postmedia.com",

        "content": "A drinking water created by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) from a collection of national data reveals the concerning number of drinking water systems with levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, . PFAS encompass thousands of man-made chemicals found in everyday items such as nonstick cookware, firefighting foams, grease-resistant food wrappers and water-resistant clothing. PFAS, known as \"forever chemicals\" because of the long time it takes them to break down, can cause . During the breakdown process, PFAS can seep into the soil and water supply. These chemicals threaten the water supply when products containing them are dumped onto the ground or into lakes and rivers. In April, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) introduced legally enforceable limits for some PFAS compounds, prompting municipalities around the nation to take a closer look at their water treatment systems. The EWG data, which was current through May 21, shows that many regions of the U.S. still have work to do before their water treatment systems are within legal limits. According to the EWG map, the most widespread PFAS contamination is in North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, central Colorado, Ohio, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Florida, although drinking water with PFAS above the new limit by the EPA is present in nearly every U.S. state. \"For all water systems with a detection of PFOS, PFOA or another PFAS, a maximum concentration for each PFAS and a maximum total PFAS concentration is displayed. The maximum levels listed are from a single point in time and do not reflect whether a water system has changed sources or is treating the water to reduce PFAS levels,\" EWG said on its website. reached out to EWG by email for comment. Officials across the nation are quickly realizing the widespread impact of PFAS and working to combat it. Several municipalities have recently for various reasons, including in Florida, where city officials are considering the approval of two new water treatment systems to reduce levels of PFAS. In Maine, in Fairfield. The contamination is believed to have come from a fertilizer sludge that was spread across farm fields. Families with impacted wells were urged to stop using the water for all uses as the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) installs filter systems in the impacted areas. The widespread presence of PFAS in water systems is prompting questions about the quality of water treatment plants as well. For example, officials found concerning levels of 1,4-dioxane, a possible carcinogen, in , New York. The village's water system is more than 100 years old, but a new treatment system could take years to complete. Hempstead is one example of local municipalities requesting help from the federal government by seeking funding for the new system.
