Shields also included more recent photos of the pair, including a candid selfie taken in front of a scenic water view in Europe. Along with these old shots, some newer ones were also included, one of them being a selfie of the two in Europe with a prepossessing water view. The actress captioned the wholesome post as follows, \"Today marks 23 years married to the love of my life. Still giddy to be stuck with you, Henchy!\" Well-known friends of the model were quick to express their happiness for the couple, one of them being Debi Mazar who chimed in by stating, “\"Love you both!

Norrie, stuck on a sparsely-populated outside court on a cold and breezy Paris afternoon in a match delayed by rain, lost in five tight sets 4-6 6-3 3-6 7-6 (5) 6-2. The 28-year-old, seeded 32, won five games in a row after trailing 4-1 to take the first set. Defeat for Cam Norrie at 🇬🇧 | — LTA (@the_LTA) Twice Norrie led by a set but twice world number 56 Kotov hit back, taking the match to a decider in a tie-break. Kotov raced into a 4-0 lead and Norrie was unable to peg him back as he bowed out at the first-round stage for the first time since 2020. “I’m pretty devastated with the result, the first four sets I was in control, I had so many chances,” said Norrie. “I didn’t play well at all but I still should have won comfortably. I felt physically good, practice has been going well. I couldn’t believe I was in a fifth set.” https://x.com/the_LTA/status/1795165025331560569 Norrie was joined on the British scrapheap by Harriet Dart, who lost 7-6 (3) 6-4 to Czech 27th seed Linda Noskova. Dart said: “I felt I played an OK match to be honest, I always knew it would be a tough match. I’m just disappointed I didn’t capitalise on some of my opportunities.” Defeats for Andy Murray and Jack Draper on Sunday means Britain’s hopes in singles now rest with Katie Boulter and Dan Evans, who play their first-round matches on Tuesday.",

        "content": "Josh is joined by Sophie Walker on this week's episode of the Sky Sports Golf podcast to reflect on the tragic news of Grayson Murray's death, before previewing the US Women's Open and hearing from Eddie Pepperell in a wide-ranging interview. It was announced over the weekend that two-time PGA Tour winner Murray passed away on Saturday after withdrawing late in his second round of the Charles Schwab Challenge on Friday. Murray's family confirmed in a statement that the 30-year-old had taken his own life after previously speaking openly about his struggles with mental health and alcoholism. \"Everybody thinks that professional golf is the best job in the world, just because you've got all the stuff, all the money, all the trophies, life must be good right? Sometimes it's not and it's a battle in your own mind,\" said Sophie Walker. \"Maybe listening to some of the stuff he said some of us might have thought he'd won that battle, but I don't think you ever do. It's a constant thing and it makes me so sad he was that low. \"It's horrible to think that's your only option.\" Tributes have poured in from across the world of golf as the sport remembers the influence of Murray, who has previously taken time to open himself up to messages from others who might have been struggling with their mental health. \"I often say, some of the lads I've played with, when I see them on the course on Tour they look like super men,\" said Walker. \"Their clothes are fresh out of the packet, their shoes, they walk around and look six foot five etc, but you're trying to put on a show for yourself in order to be as confident as possible. \"There's nothing quite like not playing well and going back to a hotel room alone and being left with your own thoughts. \"Pro golfers I think speak quite negatively to themselves at the best of times, and you would never say what you say to yourself to somebody else. \"When things are going well your phone blows up, when they aren't it's a really quiet place.\" You can listen to more by downloading the latest Sky Sports podcast via Spotify , Spreaker or Apple Podcasts .

        "content": "If you are a deeply unpopular incumbent president facing a stern uphill challenge in a bid for re-election (not unlike President Joe Biden) you would like to hit a couple public relations home runs en route to the general election. In lieu of home runs, which can certainly be tough to come by in this hyper-partisan political climate, the next best thing actually isn’t hitting singles or doubles — it’s just avoiding glaring errors. Thanks to a viral Memorial Day clip, the already- Joe Biden now finds himself trying to stave off such an error. As noted, Biden spoke Monday at the Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, as most presidents are wont to do on Memorial Day. And believe it or not, there was little issue with what Biden actually said during his speech. “Freedom has never been guaranteed — every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few and the rights of many,” Biden told those in attendance. “It matters. Our democracy is more than just a system of government. It’s the very soul of America.” Cool. Anyways, the real issue for Biden came up when a viral clip began circulating that showed the president ... less than energized. Is Biden sleeping at the Memorial Day Address?? — The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial) “Is Biden sleeping at the Memorial Day Address?” The Post Millennial asked while sharing a clip of “ Joe.” To answer that outlet’s question: No, it doesn’t appear like Biden was asleep at the wheel (well, ) during this Memorial Day service. It really does look like Biden was closing his eyes in “prayer,” or at least solemn remembrance, for the men and women who’ve given their lives in service to this great country. But the issue isn’t so much the truth of the matter (it’s impossible to tell if he was actually dozing off or not, given Biden appears to generally move at a ), so much as it’s the optics of the matter. It’s that Joe Biden was falling asleep during this moment of remembrance because that’s what 81-year-old men do after anything remotely physically or mentally taxing. They nap. And that’s a generally big problem for Biden. The man could fix the economy and cure cancer tonight, but the fact won’t change that there will always be people dubious of the man’s ability to perform due to the biological realities of aging. And yes, Biden’s chief political rival, former President Donald Trump, isn’t exactly a spring chicken either, but you can’t deny the sheer between the two men. Because of those biological realities, Biden has to outperform expectations to overcome questions about his age. He’s obviously not accomplishing that, if is to be believed. And that’s the real problem with the viral clip of Biden “napping.” Perception shapes reality, and the perception of Biden being a doddering, sleepy old fool very much feels like reality. The president would do well to avoid these types of snafus — even innocent ones like this — if he wants any shot of a second term. (Hah.)

        "content": "DALLAS — The Timberwolves’ biggest flaw heading into the postseason was quite obvious to anyone who paid attention throughout the course of the regular season: They couldn’t close games. The Wolves were quite literally one of the NBA’s worst teams in clutch-time situations over the back half of the season. Clutch time is defined as the time in the final five minutes of a game in which the margin is within five points. In those situations post-Christmas, the Wolves were outscored by 26.5 points per 100 possessions. Their defense was bad in clutch time, and their offense was worse. Ball holding, indecision and a lack of player movement left the team’s late-game offense often stuck in the muck. Missed shots and turnovers prevented Minnesota from getting back and setting its defense up to its optimal setup, which makes getting stops a chore. ADVERTISEMENT That figured to bite the Timberwolves in the playoffs. But it didn’t through the first two rounds, anyway. Anthony Edwards obliterated Phoenix down the stretch of Game 4 to close out the Wolves’ first-round series sweep in the only competitive game between the two teams. Against Denver, Game 1 and Game 7 were both in doubt in the closing minutes, only to have Minnesota’s offense prove largely unstoppable to secure the first and last victories of the series. The problems appeared to be solved. Until they weren’t. ADVERTISEMENT The late-game issues have reared their ugly heads in the Western Conference Finals. The Wolves led the bulk of the first two games of the series, only to squander advantages late. They rallied in the second half of Game 3 on Sunday and held a two-point lead with five minutes to play after Kyle Anderson’s toss at the hoop dropped to beat the shot clock with 5 minutes, 5 seconds to play. That was the last bucket of consequence the Wolves would score. Minnesota tallied just one point between Anderson’s miraculous shot and Anthony Edwards’ irrelevant layup with 15 seconds to play — a Naz Reid free throw. In between those buckets were seven missed shots and a turnover. Edwards said the ball was sticking too much in the Wolves’ hands, particularly his. “I thought it was our offense that broke down, more than anything. You’ve got to try to score alongside of them,” Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. “We just didn’t execute very well, didn’t find the open guy very well down the stretch. And when we had open looks, they were nowhere near going in.” ADVERTISEMENT It is tough to win that way. As it is when you commit two turnovers in the final minute of regulation, like Minnesota did in Game 2 en route to blowing a five-point advantage in the final 90 seconds. Then there’s Game 1, which the Wolves led by four points with 3 minutes, 37 seconds to play, only to then go scoreless until Reid’s basket with 10 seconds to play. That fatal scoring drought featured four missed shots and three turnovers. And Dallas is doing the complete opposite on the other end of the floor. The Mavericks — who sported the NBA’s fourth-best clutch-time net rating post Christmas, outscoring opponents by 23.8 points per 100 possessions — are routinely carving the Wolves’ top-ranked defense up with the game on the line. ADVERTISEMENT Oftentimes it’s via Luka Doncic sizing up an opponent 1 on 1 before either getting to the mid range to knock down a jumper, or hitting a stepback three-pointer. At other points, he’s catching the Wolves napping, like he did late Sunday, when he saw Edwards’ back turned to the play and made a quick pass that led to a hockey assist on a P.J. Washington triple to put Dallas up 107-104. Minnesota never recovered. “It starts with kind of a mental breakdown on a left-corner 3 from Washington when the game is tied,” Finch said, “and that gives them just enough breathing room.” The Mavericks are outscoring the Wolves by 39.2 points per 100 possessions in the clutch in this series. It’s the difference between the Mavericks being up 3-0 — the current state of the situation — and Minnesota potentially even leading the series. “The whole series, we’ve struggled to close games. These three-minute games that we’re playing, we’re losing,” Finch said. “That’s been the story of the series.” ADVERTISEMENT It’s easy to look at that and think how easily things could be flipped. But the reality is the playoffs reveal who you are — both your strengths and weaknesses. And this has been a major wart for Minnesota all season that was left unresolved, and now has the Wolves on the brink of elimination. “If we were winning these games, you would feel confident when you look up and see four minutes left and you’re winning the game, you’re going to think positive thoughts,” Wolves guard Mike Conley said. “I can’t speak for every person, but I’m sure we’re looking up and saying, ‘How are we going to win this one? How are we going to figure it out?’ “That’s a moment of the game where we have to be tight, together and figure it out. Obviously, (the struggles are) on our minds. For the majority of the series, we were giving ourselves a chance, giving ourselves leads, giving ourselves opportunity. We know what part of the game we need to be better at. The part that’s gonna win us the game is that fourth quarter.” Many basketball games are won in the final five minutes. Or, in the Wolves’ case, lost in the final five minutes.

        "content": "The City of Lorain’s annual Memorial Day Parade brought hundreds of people to the downtown district despite windy weather topped with cloudy skies. The parade kicked off at 11 a.m. sharp on Eighth Street and proceeded down Broadway Avenue until reaching Black River Landing, according to Lorain Mayor Jack Bradley. Bradley, who had a number of vehicles decorated with his name, walked in the parade alongside Safety Service Director Rey Carrion and others. Lorain Police cruisers led the parade under the blue and white Broadway sign with a number of its vehicles such as “The Beast,” its SWAT vehicle, and others. Multiple youth of the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps followed the leading police cruisers in their uniforms. Amy Pruitt, a mother of four Lorain High School students, grabbed a spot on the side of Broadway Avenue at 9:30 a.m. eagerly awaiting the parade. “This is one of the first events that all four of my kids are in,” Pruitt said. “I’m proud, excited and intrigued spotting them in the crowd. I’m going to root for them when I see them.” While Pruitt was excited, it was also a bittersweet day for her as the parade was also the last time her four children would be in the parade as they will be graduating. Three of Pruitt’s children were marching with the Lorain High School band while the fourth participated as part of his duties of the Junior ROTC, she said. Shannon Argenti, also of Lorain, was sitting along Broadway Avenue with her 5-year-old stepson Hunter Argenti, who was looking forward to catching and gathering the candy which was thrown out to the crowd by several people, including the Lorain Fire Department. The Argentis were in attendance to watch 15-year-old Malicai Argenti, a member of the Junior ROTC, who was marching with the group, said Argenti. “I’m looking forward to seeing him in the parade,” she said, adding that she was excited to see the parade and share in the overall experience. Several residents in street vehicles were also a part of the parade in addition to the Lorain High School and Clearview High School bands and cheerleaders. Also represented at the parade were the Veteran’s Administration Medical Transportation and Valor Home.",

        "content": "Louisiana Republican Senator John Kennedy was shocked to discover that newspaper chain/media company USA Today quietly eliminated his op-ed in which he criticized transgender athletes. Not only did the Gannett-owned paper chain delete op-ed, they didn’t even tell him they were deleting the article that had already been published by several of the chain’s participating papers days before. The article, published in eight of the Gannett papers, was entitled, “Is transgender inclusion more important than women’s sports?” and excerpts of his piece are still on the Louisianan’s senate website. But while the article is still featured on his senate website, the full article was removed from all the papers. Now, when you click to the link where the article used to appear, readers see a that reads, “Content removed: did not meet editorial standards,” and continues saying, “This content has been removed because it did not meet our editorial standards.” The senator has since told that his article was removed because he didn’t bend his knee to the woke terminology that the paper wanted him to use when speaking about radical transgenderism. slammed the USA Today, telling Fox News, that the “USA TODAY Network apparently does not like the way I express myself.” “They think they are the speech police. Drunk on certainty and virtue, they think they are our moral teacher. This attitude is why so many Americans have lost confidence in the media. The media is not going to win that trust back until they return to neutrality instead of advocacy,” Kennedy claimed. According to his website, he made a series of claims in his article denouncing , each backed up with a link to the source he used to reach his conclusions. “Some activists claim that transgender athletes are different from typical men because they take cross-sex hormones. After two years of cross-sex hormone treatments, however, biological male athletes run 12% faster and pound out 10% more push-ups than women,” Kennedy wrote. also said, “Allowing biological boys to compete as girls will harm women’s sports. Still, many activists believe their feelings and the feelings of transgender athletes are more important.” “Men and women don’t compete for the same reasons. Yet transgender activists want athletic institutions to ignore these obvious physical differences so transgender athletes can feel included, even if it hurts biological girls in the process,” the sen. also said. After the paper published the op-ed early in May, Kennedy said he noticed by May 14 that the links he supplied to the articles on his senate website no longer worked. Kennedy told Fox News that he reached out to one of the affiliated papers that originally published the article and had an email exchange with Misty Castile, the executive editor for the Shreveport Times. At first, Castile claimed that they deleted Kennedy’s article because of a lack of “citations” to support his claims. But in a follow-up email, she backtracked on that claim after Kennedy pointed out that there were half a dozen links to citations to support his claims. In other emails, Castile accused Kennedy of using “loaded language” because he wrote “biological male” and “biological female.” Castile further demanded that he rewrite the article to use the left’s woke terminology and then she would “consider” republishing the article. Kennedy blasted the paper chain, saying, “Most people don’t support allowing biological men to participate in women’s sports because they think that will bastardize sports, skew the results, and hurt women.

        "content": "The nonprofit Elizabeth River Project, which has worked for 30 years to clean up one of the nation’s most contaminated urban waterways, is set to officially open a global model for urban coastal resilience on June 1. The Ryan Resilience Lab, funded almost entirely through local donations, will demonstrate practical ways the world’s coastal residents and businesses can learn how to protect themselves, and the environment, as sea levels rise. The building is located along Knitting Mill Creek in Norfolk, a city where the tides are rising faster than anywhere on the East Coast. A public grand opening celebration is scheduled for June 1 from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at 4610 Colley Ave., Norfolk. In conjunction with the grand opening, shops up and down Colley Avenue will join forces with the Elizabeth River Project to launch an “EcoDistrict,” encouraging businesses and residents to adopt eco-friendly practices in solidarity with the new Ryan Resilience Lab in their midst. The Resilience Lab, intentionally constructed inside a flood zone along one of Norfolk’s busiest commercial corridors and flanked by multiple residential neighborhoods, showcases what the future of sustainable coastal living might look like. Inside and out, visitors will find ways to live sustainably and prepare for rising tides, project coordinators said in a news release. Everything from the floating entry pavilion and storage shed to a “living shoreline” instead of a hardened shore, an 80,000-watt solar energy system, 10 gallons of rainwater collected and reused in the toilets and a permeable parking lot to keep polluted runoff from reaching the river. Meanwhile, green roofs and walls covered in vegetation reduce runoff and conserve energy in winter and summer. For more information and to register, see elizabethriver.org .

The midfielder has reached the end of his season-long loan from the Lisbon giants with a Premiership and Scottish Cup winners medal in his pocked - but his deal includes a clause that means a £6million bid would be enough to bring the 22-year-old to Glasgow's east end long-term. However, the Portuguese U21 international appears to have hinted that he will not return to Celtic next season as he sent a message to fans on social media. Taking to his Instagram while sharing snaps of his time at Celtic Park, he wrote: \"Grateful for this season. Thank you very very much for all the support.\" Reports in Portugal suggest that a deal is still being considered by the Hoops. O Jogo claim that the Celtic Park chiefs are \"evaluating\" a permanent move for Bernardo. He has reportedly been told that he is not in the first-team plans for Benfica going into next season.

        "description": "Susan Anderson, Mike Broadfoot and Brett Wilson are this year's three inductees",
        "content": "Three southern Albertans will be inducted into the Alberta Business Hall of Fame later this year, including a longtime high-profile oilman, an early adopter of financial technology and a former pro hockey player. The co-founder and CEO of Symend, a Calgary-based tech firm that’s among Canada’s fastest-growing companies, will meanwhile receive the Southern Alberta Young Innovator Award, given each year to a business leader under 40. The annual awards, entering their 20th year running, will be handed out in early November at the Alberta Business Hall of Fame—Southern Alberta Annual Gala Dinner. Susan Anderson, Mike Broadfoot and Brett Wilson are this year’s three inductees. Anderson started her career by co-founding DirectCash Payments Inc., a publicly traded financial services company in 1997 when financial technology — commonly known as fintech — was still a fledgling industry. Over the next two decades it became the second-largest ATM company in the world, grossing more than $400 million in revenue. The company was bought in 2017 by Cardtronics Inc. in a deal valued at about $460 million. Anderson later co-founded Digital Commerce Bank, a private Canadian chartered financial institution, and is currently the company’s board chair. She’s also currently president and CEO of Cannonball Capital Inc., a Calgary-based institutional investor in venture companies, private and public equities and commercial real estate. Anderson also serves on several boards and is on the strategic advisory board of the Hotchkiss Brain Institute at the University of Alberta. Her academic career started at the University of Calgary, where she obtained a commerce degree; she later completed her law degree at the University of Alberta. Broadfoot started his career in business after a hockey career that saw him play for the University of Alberta Golden Bears and later professionally in Switzerland, where he played for one year until moving back to Alberta. Settling in Calgary, he spent five years with Gulf and Petro Can in the oil and gas sector. Over the remaining decades, he’s been a founder or early-stage principal investor and director in sectors including energy, B2B software, medical devices, fintech and property development. Broadfoot has been involved in a number of sales, including Morgan Stanley’s 2019 acquisition of Solium Capital. He’s currently involved with JEMM Properties, a developer focused on densifying Calgary’s urban core, and two tech companies in project management software and fintech. Wilson, meanwhile, comes with the highest public profile of the three, having spent three years as a “dragon” on CBC’s Dragons Den. He got his career started in the early 1990s by co-founding FirstEnergy Capital Corp. with current Calgary Flames owner Murray Edwards, Rick Grafton and Jim Davidson. The company has gone on to become Canada’s leading energy investment bank. It was solid in 2016 to Toronto-based GMP Capital Inc. Outside of the private sector, Wilson has raised money for several causes including prostate cancer and has funded research at the Calgary Counselling Centre into studying the issue of domestic abuse. Among his many public engagements, in February Wilson moderated a conversation between conservative media personality Tucker Carlson and well-known Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson. Finally, was announced as this year’s recipient of the Young Innovator Award for southern Alberta. He is the co-founder and CEO of Symend, which has quickly become one of the top telecommunication and financial services companies in the world by providing behaviour science, data science and technology to its clients. Symend was mentioned in Startup Genome’s cleantech rankings which highlighted Calgary as one of the . Symend recently completed a $151-million fundraising round, adding to the case that fintech is becoming one of the city’s sub-sector strengths. Joshaghani is also a member of the Business Council of Alberta, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce’s AI council and sits on the board at the Alberta Children’s Hospital Foundation. X:",

        "content": "THE summer heat might be something to look forward to, but with the higher temperatures comes some unwanted creepy crawlies sneaking into your home. Spiders can hide in homes and come out during mating season, which is usually from September, but that doesn't mean they're not also around before then. Luckily, one savvy woman has shared a simple trick to get rid of them for good - and you won't have to break the bank of posh traps and gadgets to do it. Anna Louisa took to Instagram to share her top tips, which include mixing together water and 20 drops of peppermint oil . Poured into a spray bottle - you can reuse an old cleaning bottle - the trick will deter spiders from lingering in your home. However, pet owners should note that this method won't be suitable for them, as peppermint oil can be harmful to some animals. Instead, the mum suggested another trick to keep spiders and pther pests at bay. \"Fruit flies dislike the smell of white vinegar so put a small bowl of it near your fruit to keep them away,\" she explained. \"I add a few drops of eucalyptus oil to mask the smell of white vinegar but this isn’t necessary.\" Other cleaning fans loved the idea and couldn't wait to try it out. \"Will be trying these this week. We’ve had them coming in through a gap in the skirting board at the back door and now coming through the front door,\" one commented on the viral clip. A second agreed: \"Yes love this trick, I tried it last year and it worked for me.\" The best part about this trick is if you don't already have vinegar a home, you can pick some up for as little as 35p in shops including Tesco, making the trick a total bargain. And another added: \"Lavender also works with ants too and spiders.\" There's one sure fire way of getting rid of spiders in your home and that is to introduce a pet to your family. In particular cats are the perfect animals to get rid of unwanted spiders, as they chase away unwanted bugs from your home. As well as peppermint, spiders are repelled by the smell of this plant . So you can either grow it as a houseplant, or place some around your bathrooms and wardrobes to help make it a less appealing home for the insects. Plus it make your home smell wonderful, so it’s a win-win. Pest control expert Paul Blackhurst says start with your bins. He told the Express : \"As with most pests, the best way to control spiders is to limit their food source.\" There's a big chance that you will see more spiders situated around the bin in your home. That's because your waste attracts flies - which are food for spiders. To eradicate this issue, one thing that you can do it try moving your bins outside or as far away as possible, while also ensuring that you keep the lids closed whenever you're not using them. Another tip is to keep the bins clear from any doorways and windows that lead into your house. Common pests in the garden don’t need to be a cause for alarm. If you can identify them, you can work on getting rid of them and preventing them from returning. Aphids (Greenfly, Blackfly) Aphids are extremely common and can impact plant growth. They have tiny soft pear-shaped bodies, and are usually green or black. You may spot them clustered on the stem of soft shoots – look under leaves in particular – or may find a sticky substance on your plants that gives away aphids have been there sucking at the sap. Whitefly These small white-winged insects are related to aphids, at just 1 or 2 mm in length, and look very much like white moths as adults. They can be found on the underside of leaves, preferring younger, fresher leaves. They fly in clusters when you disturb them. Their lifecycle is only three weeks long, which means an infestation can occur very rapidly. Slugs An unmissable, squashy-looking body plus small sensory tentacles on its head. Slugs move along on one muscular foot. They range in scale from surprisingly small to terrifyingly large; limax cinereoniger species can grow comfortably beyond 20 cm in length. Cabbage Moth Caterpillar Cabbage moth caterpillars happily make their way into the heart of the vegetables, The caterpillars are distinguished in shades of yellow or browny green with no hair. Mealy Bug Mealybugs are tiny oval-shaped insects that have a white, powdery wax coating. There are several different species, many of which have what looks like legs coming from their sides and back end. In their earliest stage of life, it’s entirely possible to mistake them for fungus and not recognise them as insects at all.",

        "description": "No aspiring molcajete owner should be without our guide to preparing, cooking with and caring for their traditional pestle and mortar.The post Learn how to ‘molcajetear’ like a Mexican appeared first on Mexico News Daily",
        "content": "Molcajetes have been used across Mesoamerica for centuries and are cherished as one of Mexico’s most beloved kitchen tools. A three-legged stone mortar, the molcajete is made of volcanic stone, as is the tejolote, its cylindrical pestle. To “molcajetear” — Mexico has a knack for turning nouns into verbs — means pressing and grinding ingredients against the walls of the molcajete, imparting a unique flavor and texture. Its rough surface is perfect for grinding and crushing a variety of ingredients. Perfect for creating unique flavors and textures, the molcajete is a beloved tool for making salsas, guacamole, dips and marinades. It’s also ideal for grinding spices and herbs, releasing their aromatic oils. Even nuts and seeds can be ground to create flavorful pastes and powders. The molcajete’s rustic charm and efficient grinding capabilities make it a cornerstone of authentic Mexican cooking. Traditional molcajetes have always been made of volcanic stone, which is natural, non-toxic and safe for food processing. Crafting a molcajete involves a centuries-old carving technique. When you buyone made of volcanic stone, you’re supporting artisans’ craftsmanship and livelihoods. Buying an authentic molcajete isn’t just about bragging rights. Nowadays, there are many cement replicas for sale that can deceive buyers. The big reason to avoid cement molcajetes is that they’re not safe for cooking. Cement wears away when ground, releasing toxins and paint into your food. So, how can you tell if the molcajete you’re eyeing is made of volcanic stone or cement? Volcanic stone has pores, since it was once lava cooling off, passing tiny sulfuric bubbles to its surface. Some molcajetes will have a lot of wide pores, while others may have very small orifices. However, all of them have a rugged surface that makes them effective for grinding. A very smooth surface without pores is usually an indicator of a cement piece. A cement molcajete will absorb water and become evenly soaked, while volcanic stone holds water without absorbing it. However, some volcanic stone pieces have too many wide pores and can leak. While this type may still be an authentic piece, it won’t be a good option for salsa making, as the liquid will filter out. The ultimate test is curing the molcajete, as one made of volcanic stone will immediately release sediments as part of the process. Molcajetes need to be cured before you use them, because the natural stone tends to release residues that you don’t want in your food . Curing for kitchen duty is a simple process involving rice, salt and a little elbow grease: There’s nothing quite like a salsa roja molcajeteada — oh yes, Mexico also loves turning nouns into adjectives. Here’s a simple recipe to get you started. Remember, salsas are an art form, not an exact science. Channel your inner maestro when picking the type and amount of ingredients you use. 3 red chilis 3 tomatoes 2 cloves garlic 1 pinch dried oregano 1 pinch salt Fresh cilantro Molcajete can be used as a noun, a verb and an adjective. Why stop there? When you see molcajete as a dish on a menu, they’re offering you another level of deliciousness. A molcajete contains a medley of grilled meats, vegetables, cheese and salsa. This dish, meant to be shared, is served in a big warm molcajete in the center of the table. Everyone dives in with a warm tortilla in hand. It’s a joyful dining experience made special by the beauty of a molcajete overflowing with tasty goodies. Here’s a fun tidbit: I’ve seen people find solace in the act of grinding with a molcajete. Rhythmically grinding stuff with your sheer force can release pent-up energy and emotions. Who knew that whipping up a sassy salsa could be so therapeutic?

        "content": "WEBER COUNTY, Utah ( ABC4 ) — When storm clouds rolled into northern Utah on Saturday, a hiker became stranded on Lewis Peak, prompting a rescue that lasted until the early morning hours. Weber County Sheriff’s Office Search and Rescue said the hiker became disoriented amid the bad weather, and couldn’t find his way off the 8,000-foot mountain overlooking North Ogden. The search team was able to determine the hiker’s general area from a cell phone ping, and later a drone honed in on his exact location. Climb, horse and motorcycle crews responded. However, due to wet conditions and temperatures dropping into the evening, the Department of Public Safety’s helicopter was called to lift the man off the mountain. At around 1 a.m. Sunday, the rescue was completed. Officials said that neither the hiker nor the rescuers were hurt.",

        "content": "America's Got Talent judge Sofia Vergara's heart wasn’t all in at first when it came to moving into her Los Angeles home. Things weren't “coming out the way I wanted,” she conveyed during an Architectural Digest tour of the space. But it eventually worked out in her favor. While giving Architectural Digest a tour of her abode for the March cover story, Sofia confessed that she depended on her designer Ohara Davies-Gaetano to bring her “homey and comfortable” concept to life while she was going through a difficult time in her life, per Yahoo. “I loved working with Ohara. She kind of saved my life because I was at a little of a crossroads,” Vergara explained. “It was either, ‘I’m going to hate this house or I’m going to love this house. What am I going to do? I don’t want to move in here because I don’t think things are coming out the way I wanted.’” Sofia Vergara’s top America’s Got Talent looks ranked as star turns up heat Sofía Vergara's age wasn't only reason she didn't want baby with Joe Manganiello Sofia purchased the $26 million Los Angeles residence in 2020 when she was still married to her husband at the time, Joe Manganiello. The pair reported their split in July 2023 after seven years of marriage, and Manganiello went on to file for divorce just two days later. Trying to stay positive, Vergara continued with the renovation undertaking for her home and was determined to make the house her own. She was sure to fill it to the brim with some of her favorite things, including her collections of crystal birds and fine china. A lot of thought went into the home. Sofia worked with Davies-Gaetano to curate a collection of antique items from Sweden, Spain, France, and Italy in order to create “a house with history and texture.” The home soon started to look like “a well-lived house,” which is exactly what Sofia hoped for, though the home was on the newer end and just built in the 1990s. Sofia has shared one design element in the living room and family room that always catches her eye. “I love it because they open to the backyard which is my favorite thing about the house,” she says. “Every room opens to the pool and the backyard — even when you’re upstairs in the guest rooms.” DON'T MISS... Sofia Vergara’s top America’s Got Talent looks ranked as star turns up heat Sofía Vergara's age wasn't only reason she didn't want baby with Joe Manganiello Sofia Vergara confirms romance as she goes Instagram official with new man One of Sofia’s most favored parts of the home is her backyard loaded with tropical plants that remind her of her home country Colombia. “When I found this house, it was horrific. It was like a castle in Transylvania,” she explained. “But when I walked outside and saw this garden, I knew this was where I wanted to live. This outdoor area is like an extension of the house. The most special area in the house.” Some more of her favorite areas in her home include her bedroom which makes her feel “comfortable and sexy,” along with her enormous closet which houses clothing items and accessories that are in rainbow order. “This is where I actually really live, in my closet,” she said. “This is where I spend most of my time – this is like a girl’s dream.”",

Nadal, who turns 38 on 3, went down 6-3, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 in the first round to number four Zverev, suffering only his fourth loss in 116 matches at Roland Garros since his 2005 title-winning debut. It was the first time he had been defeated in in the opening round and will again to questions over his long-term future in the sport. \"I don't know if it's the last time I'll be here in front of of you,\" he said. \"If it is, then you have been amazing. The feelings I have today are difficult to describe in words. It is the place I the most.\" He added: \"It's hard to say about the future. I am travelling with my and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago. \"Maybe in two months I say it's enough. That is something I don't feel yet.\" Nadal not return for the 2025 French Open but he still plans to play the at Roland Garros in . Nadal, an singles medallist in in 2008 and doubles champion at the Rio Games, later told reporters: \"That's my main goal now. \"I need to prepare myself the proper way to to arrive healthy and well-prepared.\" He won't make the rankings cut for the , but as a Grand Slam winner he would be eligible for a spot reserved for major winners. Plagued by injuries, which had limited him to just four events since last year, former number one Nadal is now 275 in the rankings and was unseeded in . \"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect. You know, I wake up one day and I found a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,\" said Nadal of his recent battles with a hip injury. In his career, he has had to skip 11 Grand Slams. That is certain to become 12 next month when he is likely to skip where he was champion in 2008 and 2010. \"It looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the again on clay,\" he said. \"I don't think it's going to be smart after the things that happened to my body now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay.

        "content": "PERTH, Australia — In an industry first, Rio Tinto and BHP will collaborate on the testing of large battery-electric haul truck technology in the Pilbara, Western Australia, to accelerate the potential for its future deployment. The two companies will work with manufacturers Caterpillar and Komatsu to conduct independent trials of their battery-electric haul trucks, including testing of battery, static and dynamic charging systems, to assess performance and productivity in the Pilbara environment. The collaboration reflects the individual commitments made from BHP, Rio Tinto, Komatsu and Caterpillar to support Rio Tinto and BHP’s shared ambition of net zero operational greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. As part of the collaboration, two Cat 793 haul trucks will be trialled from the second half of 2024, and two Komatsu 930 haul trucks tested from 2026 at mine sites in Western Australia’s Pilbara region. Caterpillar and Komatsu will each provide one truck each to both BHP and Rio Tinto for these trials. BHP will trial the Caterpillar trucks, while Rio Tinto will trial the Komatsu trucks. Outcomes of the trials will be shared between BHP and Rio Tinto. These trials represent the first stage of battery-electric haul truck testing at BHP and Rio Tinto’s Pilbara operations. Ongoing testing, development and refinement of truck and battery design is anticipated with each manufacturer. This will inform the approach for testing a larger number of haul trucks and the potential deployment of battery-electric haul truck fleets into each company’s operations. Rio Tinto Iron Ore Chief Executive Simon Trott said: “This collaboration brings together two leading global miners with two of the world’s biggest manufacturers of haul trucks to work on solving the critical challenge of zero-emissions haulage. “There is no clear path to net zero without zero-emissions haulage, so it’s important that we work together to get there as quickly and efficiently as we can. Testing two types of battery-electric haul trucks in Pilbara conditions will provide better data, and by combining our efforts with BHP we will accelerate learning. “As we work to repower our Pilbara operations with renewable energy, collaborations like this move us closer to solving the shared challenge of decarbonising our operations, and meeting our net zero commitments.” BHP President Australia Geraldine Slattery said: “Operational decarbonisation relies on breakthroughs in technology and partnerships like this will help drive our industry forward. We are thrilled to work with Rio Tinto, Caterpillar and Komatsu on these trials. “Replacing diesel as a fuel source requires us to develop a whole new operational ecosystem to surround the fleet. We need to address the way we plan our mines, operate our haulage networks, and consider the additional safety and operational considerations that these changes will bring. This is why trials are so critical to our success as we seek to test and learn how these new technologies will work in practice and integrate into our mines. “We’ve already seen a step-change reduction in Scope 1 and 2 operational greenhouse gas emissions through switching some of our supply to renewable electricity, and we are looking to build on that progress through development of battery-electric technology to reduce diesel usage across our operations.” Note to editors In 2021, Rio Tinto and BHP worked with both Caterpillar and Komatsu to support the development and validation of their prototype battery-electric haul trucks. The trucks included in these trials are based on these prototypes. Carbon emissions from diesel consumption in our mining equipment and rail fleet accounted for 12% of Rio Tinto’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2023. Carbon emissions from the combustion of diesel accounted for around 40% of BHP’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions in FY2020. Press release from Rio Tinto .

        "content": "Even after a six-win 2023 season, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the New York Giants. Here are three reasons they’ll bounce back in 2024. 1. Daniel Jones is not as bad as you think Jones may have won just two of six games before tearing his ACL last year but played well enough in 2022 to earn a four-year, $160M contract in 2023. In his first (and only) full season playing in Brian Daboll’s offense, Jones finished as the NFL’s 15th-leading passer with 3,205 yards. While that's hardly a Hall of Fame stat line, he added seven scores and 708 yards rushing that year. By comparison, Bills quarterback Josh Allen finished 2018 as the NFL’s 32nd-leading passer with 2,074 yards and 12 interceptions in his first season with Daboll as coordinator. If Jones and his coach can get back to what worked in 2022 and work out the bugs from 2023, there’s no reason to think they can’t succeed in 2024. 2. Malik Nabers is as good as you think Nabers ranked second in the FBS with 1,569 receiving yards and tied for third with 14 touchdowns in 2023. He helped LSU quarterback Jayden Daniels win a Heisman and could be the team's best wide receiver since Odell Beckham Jr. Malik Nabers recorded four receptions of 25+ yards in the first half against Mississippi State, the most for an LSU player in the opening half of a game since Ja'Marr Chase in 2019 vs Vanderbilt. pic.twitter.com/1H7AezsNOr At six feet tall and 200 pounds, Nabers can play all three receiver spots and may have to given the team’s lack of playmakers. NFL Network’s Lance Zierlein compares him favorably to the Vikings’ Justin Jefferson, and Pro Football Focus ranked Nabers as the best wide receiver in the 2024 NFL Draft. 3. Tyrone Tracy Jr. could be a weapon As a former wide receiver, Tracy should see the field immediately as a third-down back and possibly more as the season goes on. He played 38 games at wide receiver for Iowa before transferring to Purdue in 2022 and switching to running back in 2023. Tracy led the Big Ten in yards per carry (6.3) last season by forcing 46 missed tackles on just 114 carries. He also had eight touchdowns. Taken in the fifth round, Tracy could be the steal of this year’s draft and a valuable piece of the offense moving forward.",

        "description": "The airline entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this year and has a five-year restructuring plan.",
        "content": "GOL Linhas Aéreas of Brazil is working on its exit from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process and earlier today announced a five-year recovery plan. is a low-cost carrier in Brazil that operates a fleet of Boeing 737 aircraft, one of several airlines worldwide to do so. It is the second Brazilian airline to enter the Chapter 11 Bankruptcy process in recent years and hopes to exit soon. According to a report today from , the airline will receive more than $1 billion in capital injections. Earlier today, GOL revealed its 5-Year Financial Plan to restructure and put the airline back on its feet. The plan outlines that by 2026, GOL hopes to return to its pre-pandemic capacity. Additionally, the airline aims to expand its network domestically and internationally, something that already happened last week through the announcement of a codeshare with Azul Linhas Aéreas on some routes. By 2029, GOL expects to have 169 planes in its fleet, a net increase of 31 aircraft based on the current fleet. In the coming years, many aircraft will be retired, and GOL will modernize its fleet. The airline's order book currently has 88 planes, 63 Boeing 737 MAX 8s and 25 Boeing 737 MAX 10s (which have not been certified). A significant portion of GOL's five-year plan is to inject $1.5 billion in capital by issuing new shares and refinancing nearly $2 billion of its debt. After the new plan was announced, shares in Brazil dropped up to 3.5%, and GOL said there was a significant chance its shares would hit \"minimal value upon emergence\" from bankruptcy. \"We are pleased to reach another important milestone in our financial restructuring process. Since the beginning of this process, GOL has continued to operate without interruptions, demonstrating solidity in executing our commercial strategy and cost management. We have successfully renegotiated agreements with our lessors for most of our aircraft and are investing in our engines and expanding our operational fleet.\" - Celso Ferrer, Chief Executive Officer, GOL Linhas Aéreas Last week, GOL and Azul Linhas Aéreas took a step that fed rumors of a merger. The airlines announced a codeshare agreement to expand their domestic networks. Their respective codes will only be placed on routes operated by one of the airlines. According to Azul's president, Abhi Shah, this creates more than 2,700 one-stop connection opportunities. Brazil only has three major players in the domestic market: GOL, Azul, and LATAM Brasil (formerly TAM). Between GOL and Azul, the two have 52% of seats available in May. Two big airlines joining forces in Brazil is not standard and feeds the rumors that Azul is trying to purchase GOL and merge the two airlines. Though neither airline has openly discussed the merger, Azul's CEO, John Rodgerson, has been straightforward about the airline's interest in consolidating the Brazilian market. When LATAM went through its Chapter 11 process, there were plenty of rumors that it would merge with Azul.",

        "description": "Polk certainly has some lofty goals.",
        "content": "Before the New England Patriots made Ja’Lynn Polk a second-round pick during the 2024 NFL Draft, the Washington Huskies wide receiver returned to Lufkin High School in Lufkin, Texas, to speak with current student-athletes about the next step of his playing career. \"He told the kids, 'Mark it down, I will win a Super Bowl and I will be All-Pro,'\" Lufkin football head coach Todd Quick said about Polk's visit while speaking with Keagan Stiefel of NESN. \"His goals are lofty, but they’re goals he can reach.\" New England selected quarterback Drake Maye with the third overall pick and later grabbed receiver Javon Baker in the fourth round. Over the weekend, Mike Reiss of ESPN noted how former Patriots receiver and Super Bowl XXXIX Most Valuable Player Deion Branch explained how \"it's super valuable\" for New England to have Polk, Maye and Baker develop together from springtime workouts through at least the first few seasons of their pro careers. While Polk built his reputation with Washington, he previously featured for the Texas Tech Red Raiders and played under wide receivers coach Joel Filani. During a chat with Stiefel, Filani compared Polk to two of the NFL's best players at the position. \"He’s just so strong and can control his body,\" Filani said about Polk. \"He can separate enough to where he can make contested catches but give the quarterback an opportunity to get him the ball. I know he wants to be a No. 1. He’s working toward that, and there’s only so many Justin Jeffersons and Ja’Marr Chases, but you talk about a guy like Stefon Diggs — these guys are unwilling to not be the top guy. I see him competing for the top spot, and I think he’ll attack that and take it.\" The Patriots currently lack a proven No. 1 receiver and seemingly aren't in a hurry to trade for a big-name target ahead of training camp. It's unclear if Maye or veteran Jacoby Brissett will begin the upcoming season as New England's QB1, but Polk should receive plenty of opportunities to build chemistry with both signal-callers over the next several months.",

Troopers were called to the three-vehicle crash around 2:10 a.m., state police said in a press release . Their initial investigation suggests that a 53-year-old Quincy resident was driving a Toyota RAV4 north on the southbound side of the road when it hit a Toyota Camry head-on. The driver of the Toyota Camry — a 21-year-old Quincy resident — was declared dead at the scene, state police said. The 53-year-old was taken to a hospital where they were also declared dead. After crashing with the RAV4, the Camry hit another vehicle, but that vehicle’s driver was not hurt in the crash, state police said. No further information, including the identities of the deceased drivers, has been released. More similar stories",

        "content": "Rick Brant has reason to be excited about next year’s National Aboriginal Hockey Championships (NAHC). Brant is the CEO of the Indigenous Sport, Physical Activity & Recreation Council (I-SPARC), the governing body for Indigenous athletics and recreation in British Columbia. I-SPARC oversees the selection of B.C. squads for the annual NAHC, which features elite Indigenous players from across the country, primarily ages 13 to 17. Earlier this month it was announced that Tk̓emlúps te Secwépemc (formerly the Kamloops Indian Band) will co-host the 2025 NAHC. “It deepens the shared experience for all involved when an Indigenous community hosts such a prestigious Indigenous sporting event,” Brant said. “So, we are thrilled for Tk̓emlúps te Secwépemc to be partnering with the city of Kamloops to deliver the 2025 National Aboriginal Hockey Championships.” The NAHC has been held annually since 2002. The tournament, however, was cancelled in both 2020 and 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2025 event will mark the third time it has been staged in British Columbia. The tourney was first held in the province in 2004 in Prince George. And then the 2017 event was held in the Cowichan Valley district in the province. “It will be a special experience for our teams to compete for a national title in front of a home crowd,” Brant said. Based on recent history, there’s a good chance both the British Columbia female and male squads could capture some hardware at the 2025 tournament. Both B.C. entrants ended up winning the bronze medal in their categories at this year’s NAHC, which concluded earlier this month in Grande Prairie, Alta. The B.C. male program has enjoyed tremendous success in recent times at the national tournament. During the last 10 times the event it has been held, the B.C. male squad has won a medal every single tourney. That medal haul includes three golds, one silver and six bronze. Besides this year, the B.C. female team also won the bronze at the 2022 tourney, which was held in the Nova Scotia community of Membertou. The dates for the 2025 tournament have been set for May 5 to May 10. All matches will be staged at the McArthur Island Sport and Event Centre in Kamloops. Joshua Gottfriedson, the acting chief of Tk̓emlúps te Secwépemc, was pleased to hear the news of where the national tourney will be held next year. “We are honored to welcome elite Indigenous hockey players from across Canada to our city,” he said. “This event not only showcases exceptional talent but also celebrates cultural unity and pride.” Kamloops’ deputy mayor Bill Sarai said his city it excited to host next year’s event. “This tournament highlights our relationship with Tk̓emlúps te Secwépemc, whose unceded ancestral lands we occupy, alongside our dedicated community partners and volunteers,” he said. “Welcoming Indigenous athletes, coaches, and families from diverse communities, we aim to amplify Indigenous voices and the beauty of the local Secwépemc culture and the culture of every athlete at the games.” Lana Popham, B.C.’s minister of Tourism, Arts, Culture and Sport, also welcomed the news of the 2025 NAHC. “These championships are a great opportunity to bring benefits to the region by attracting visitors, fostering job creation and boosting revenue for local businesses,” she said. “I also commend the celebration of Indigenous culture as a prominent feature of these games. Truth and reconciliation is at the heart of our government’s work and a priority in BC’s sport sector.” It remains to be seen how many squads will participate at the 2025 NAHC. The tournament traditionally features provincial, territorial or regional representatives. The 2024 event in Grande Prairie featured 14 competing teams, seven female and seven male. Ontario clubs ended up winning the gold medal in both categories. Besides B.C., other squads that competed in both divisions, were from Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Team Atlantic and Team Eastern Door and the North (Quebec). Since 2017 the two champs of the NAHC are presented with the Turtle Island Cup, which was created by Carey Newman, a First Nations artist from Vancouver Island. Windspeaker.com",

        "description": "The dog stepped in when the owner couldn't move after he fell and obstructed his breathing.",
        "content": "A day after a dog was adopted from a New Mexico animal shelter, the employees received an unexpected call from the person who adopted the canine. Instead of potentially bad news shelters often get about adopters changing their minds about the pet they brought home, Andrew Budek-Schmeisser wanted to share nothing but praise for the dog who saved his life. Budek-Schmeisser adopted Peanut on March 9 from the Animal Welfare Department after a friend suggested getting a dog tall enough for him to lean on. He has a service dog, but a larger, more sturdy dog would help him as he has difficulty walking. He told that he has a number of illnesses, including cancer and heart problems, and his walking is shaky. The next day after bringing Peanut home, Budek-Schmeisser was outside getting to know the Great Dane and pit mix when he fell and hit his head, obstructing his airway. Peanut immediately stepped in to help. \"I couldn't do anything about it, but Peanut could,\" he said. \"Peanut cleared my airway, and when I was breathing well enough again, he sat me up. He and another dog helped move me to a chair where I could recover.\" Budek-Schmeisser assumes that Peanut and his service dog, Belle, communicated with each other during the incident. Belle is a wolf hybrid, so she doesn't have the strength and height Peanut possesses, he explained. Peanut cleared his airway and got him into a position to breathe again. Then, the two dogs helped move him to a chair. Peanut sat with him, his head against Budek-Schmeisser's chest, making sure he was still breathing and not going to fall again. \"I would not have expected a dog to understand within 24 hours what to do or to have the initiative to do what was necessary,\" he said. \"When I realized what he was doing, I had to put my life and future into his hands, I had to trust him.\" Between that incident and learning the ropes from Belle, Peanut stays by his side constantly. Peanut forgoes what he wants to do, which is chasing lizards, and instead always focuses on keeping Budek-Schmeisser safe. Budek-Schmeisser's biggest takeaway from this incredible moment was not that his life was saved. Instead, Budek-Schmeisser reflected on the fact Peanut waited in a crowded for five months, and instead of giving up, the shelter kept him and saw he could make a difference in someone's life. \"Many dogs and cats waiting out there in shelters that can make a difference in people's lives. All they need is an opportunity,\" he said. \"Healing may come on four paws.\" The shelter was touched to hear about the incredible rescue, which further proves that adopting animals is a win-win for everyone involved. \"A faithful companion is gained, a friendship is formed and a life is saved,\" marketing manager Desiree Cawley told . \"In this circumstance, they both saved each other.\" The Animal Welfare Department currently houses over 700 pets patiently waiting for their forever homes. Cawley said the adoption fee is waived for all pets at the city shelters, including spay or neuter, microchip, I.D. tag, and vaccinations. According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, 6.3 million pets enter U.S. shelters each year, an average of 17,260 a day. The number of dogs and cats taken in by pet shelters hit 46,807 during January 2023, an increase of 1,744 compared with January 2022, the 24Pet Shelter Watch Report found. Around 920,000 surrendered animals are euthanized every year. Shelters are striving to minimize euthanasia rates by promoting adoption campaigns, spaying and neutering programs, and behavior rehabilitation.

        "description": "They came for 'Jaws' — and got more than a mouthful.",
        "content": "A theater in Beverly, Massachusetts, is apologizing to patrons who attended a screening of “Jaws” over the weekend, after star Richard Dreyfuss allegedly made comments many patrons considered to be sexist and homophobic. The Cabot Theater hosted “An Evening With Richard Dreyfuss + Jaws Screening,” where attendees were likely fans of the Steven Spielberg classic, hoping for anecdotes about the film. However, Dreyfuss, 76, reportedly went on a rogue rant that ranged from talking about Barbra Streisand, to his opinions on transgender youth and gender affirmation, as well as the Academy Awards’ inclusivity rules. Attendees took to social media to express their disappointment. “We walked out of his interview tonight along with hundred of others because of his racist homophobic mysogynistic rant,” one person commented on The Cabot’s recent Facebook post . “Richard Dreyfuss is an embarrassment to society. I walked out tonight because of his small minded bigoted view of women and choice,” another wrote. One commenter shared that the audience thought the event would be “a light, fun evening listening to stories and anecdotes about RD’s time on the Vineyard making Jaws.” They wrote, “This was disgusting. How could the Cabot not have vetted his act better. Apparently (I found out too late), he has a reputation for spewing this kind of racist, homophobic, misogynistic bullcrap...We did NOT get what we paid for.” The venue sent out an apology email to attendees and expressed their regret in a statement obtained by The Hollywood Reporter . “We are aware of, and share serious concerns, following the recent event with Richard Dreyfuss prior to a screening of the film ‘Jaws’ at The Cabot. The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold as an organization. We deeply regret the distress that this has caused to many of our patrons,” a representative wrote. “We regret that an event that was meant to be a conversation to celebrate an iconic movie instead became a platform for political views.

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors preparing for a market contraction should consider these three companies among cloud computing stocks to sell.The post 3 Sorry Cloud Computing Stocks to Sell in May While You Still Can appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Though the cloud computing sector has seen generous growth over the last five years, some analysts have wondered if the market is overvalued. However, there is no simple answer to this question, as the concept of cloud computing can refer to any number of companies that provide an offsite technical solution for customers. With the industry’s potential projected to grow to $2.3 trillion by 2032, it’s important to know which cloud computing stocks to sell and which to buy. Currently, some business analysts believe the future of cloud computing is industry-specific, meaning that the companies with lucrative niches are likely to go the furthest. It also means that companies with less adaptable and relevant business models over time are likely to suffer long-term. Thus, the three stocks mentioned in this article might have upsides in the short term but are likely to remain stable as the cloud service industry progresses. Workiva (WK) When looking at the big picture regarding Workiva (NYSE: WK ) the stock is up 56% over the last five years. This is despite its lack of profitability over the same time frame and reality might finally be catching up to it. The company’s cloud-based software is essentially a one-stop shop for financial reporting, audit preparation and risk management and has been the focal point of the hype around Workiva. There are two ways of looking at the company’s current trajectory. First, the company could be undergoing a period of price correction, as many of the cloud-based and computing-centric companies are now under the microscope due to whispers of an artificial intelligence bubble. Second, the company could be overvalued and in a generous downturn as it continually struggles to generate income . Though its software-as-a-service model can be lucrative over time, its original investors could lose patience soon. Thus, it might be best to start considering Workvia as one of the cloud computing stocks to sell. Zoom Video Communications (ZM) For a brief moment during the remote-work paradigm of the COVID-19 pandemic, it seemed like Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM ) was the future of productivity. After all, between 2020 and 2021 , nearly everyone’s remote working experience involved the company’s video call application. Yet, the reality of market saturation might be setting in for ZM stock as the company faces a stagnating market for video call software. Beyond the market slowdown, Zoom now faces major competition from established industry giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO ) with their respective Teams and Webex software. Thus, the company’s stock could be approaching another selloff wave as investors recognize its uncompetitive position. Moreover, if you were one of the investors who had initially invested in the stock during its peak run in 2020, there’s likely no chance of seeing performance like that again . These days, Zoom is a shell of its former self simply because it faces competitors who can price video call products more competitively due to diversification. Zscaler (ZS) This last pick is somewhat mercurial in terms of potential, as it relies on a very specific subset of business to prosper amidst a period of tumultuous growth. As a cloud cyber-security company, Zscaler (NASDAQ: ZS ) could have a long runway ahead of it or a slow decay. Currently, the stock commands strong buy ratings from several analysts. However, its overvaluation looms. This is based on factors such as repeated quarterly losses amidst an increasingly competitive market with competitors like Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ) and Palo Alto (NASDAQ: PANW ). Moreover, Baird recently adjusted its price target from $265 to $260 . While not an excessive decrease and still representing an outperformance rating, it does signal caution ahead of Zscaler’s next earnings report. Thus, the best time to sell could be after its Q3 earnings report, should investor optimism continue to drive the stock up before a correction cycle.

        "description": "The discovery that pollution from a paper mill is contributing to the long-standing mercury poisoning afflicting Grassy Narrows First Nation is another example of widespread environmental racism, say federal MPs.",
        "content": "The discovery that pollution from a paper mill is contributing to the long-standing mercury poisoning afflicting Grassy Narrows First Nation is another example of widespread environmental racism, say federal MPs. The mercury contamination at Grassy Narrows dates back to the 1960s and ‘70s, when Dryden Chemical dumped roughly 10 metric tonnes of mercury into the English-Wabigoon River system. The pollution has caused serious health problems for the vast majority of members of Grassy Narrows and Wabaseemoong First Nations, including neurological issues, birth defects and more. “The reality is Indigenous communities, racialized communities have to continue to suffer when corporations pollute,” Edmonton-Griesbach NDP MP Blake Desjarlais said, pointing to the Grassy Narrow’s case and Danielle Smith’s government’s RStar program that “uses tax dollars” to remediate industry’s abandoned wells. And this is not the first recent, high-profile example of environmental pollution driven by corporate interest that has impacted Indigenous communities. Last year, it came to light that local Indigenous communities including the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation were not properly notified of seepage from tailings ponds until a large spill, nine months later, brought the issue into the spotlight. Imperial Oil and the Alberta Energy Regulator say there were no impacts to the water supply or environment, but this did not assuage the fear and anxiety felt by ACFN and Mikisew Cree First Nation members, many of whom rely on fish, game and gathering out on the land. Communities have long been calling on the federal government to conduct health studies on the cumulative impacts of the oilsands development, pointing to cases of a rare bile duct cancer. Then, in late April, Aamjiwnaang First Nation in Sarnia Ont. — also known as Chemical Valley due to the more than 60 petrochemical plants in the region — measured benzene levels 424 times higher than acceptable levels. Benzene is highly toxic and a known carcinogen, used in chemical manufacturing to produce certain types of plastics. The chemical is known to cause cancers and increase rates of respiratory illness. Aamjiwnaang First Nation said elevated benzene levels in the air from the Ineos Styrolution facility caused several community members to fall ill. In response, on May 17, Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault issued a 14-day emergency interim order to the petrochemical industry in Sarnia, ordering companies to implement abatement measures to contain pollution, including fully closed vents and vapour control on storage tanks that contain high concentrations of the chemical. News of the Grassy Narrows mercury poisoning made a stir in Question Period on May 23, when NDP MP Charlie Angus called it “an unprecedented corporate crime.” “We now learn that the Dryden Fibre Canada mill has been dumping sulfates into the Wabigoon River, which has been driving the mercury crisis for a new generation,” said Angus. He asked the federal government what it will do to hold the company accountable and clean up the contamination. Liberal MP Jenica Atwin pointed to an Indigenous Services Canada project that received $57.5 million in Budget 2024 to construct a care home to offer specialized care and assisted living to people with methylmercury poisoning. “We can’t just slap a hospital or a special medicalized program that’s going to help mercury victims, it should have never happened to begin with,” Desjarlais said. “Imagine if this happened in Montreal, imagine if we dumped all of the metallurgic chemicals into the St. Lawrence, how fast, how quickly this problem will be resolved,” he added. In recent years, sulfur and organic compound discharge from the Dryden Fibre Canada mill has created a dangerous chemical reaction in the Wabigoon River resulting in high levels of methylmercury, researchers from Western University said Thursday. The levels of methylmercury — the most toxic form of mercury — in the river’s fish may be twice as high as they would be without the mill discharge, the researchers said. “We have individuals who are eating the fish that is now highly contaminated with an even worse substance than they would have ever imagined,” Desjarlais said. “These things were preventable.” Desjarlais said there are two root causes for these repeated instances of environmental racism, the first being the current neoliberal economic system, which favours free markets and deregulation. “Neoliberalism has given corporations unfettered power to act as an individual, for the better pursuit of their own interests at the cost of other people,” he said. This should be countered by giving those same individual rights of corporations to water, air and the land, Desjarlais said. “The things we rely on most for our longevity as a species should be protected,” he said. He also advocates giving greater power to Indigenous jurisdictions, referring to the fact that Indigenous lands make up 20 per cent of the world, but contain 80 per cent of the world’s biodiversity. Green Party Leader Elizabeth May also called out Alberta’s tailings pond debacle as another example of environmental racism in action. “It’s been proven now for more than a decade that the toxic chemicals from the tailings ponds are reaching the Athabasca River, which is a violation of the federal Fisheries Act, yet no charges are laid,” said May in a phone interview with Canada’s National Observer. May has a private members bill that seeks to address environmental racism. Bill C-226 is one Senate vote away from becoming law. May said it’s unclear when the vote will be held, but the bill is expected to pass. Once passed, the bill will require the federal government to examine the links between race, socio-economic status and environmental risk as well as compel the environment and climate change minister to develop a national strategy to address the harms caused by environmental racism. May hopes the passage of C-226 will “result in a meaningful change” to get us beyond just talking about the pattern of environmental pollution and racism, by identifying the responsibility of governments to protect marginalized, racialized and Indigenous communities. She looks to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s environmental justice program — created in 1994 – as inspiration for what Canada should do. — with files from Paola Loriggio, the Canadian Press Matteo Cimellaro & Natasha Bulowski / Canada’s National Observer / Local Journalism Initiative",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — A former business associate of James Biden has agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to defraud Medicare of $51 million through a lab-testing company linked to the first brother. Keaton Langston, 39, admitted to using pharmacies, durable medical equipment companies and a laboratory in which he had a financial interest to bill for unnecessary tests and orders, the Justice Department disclosed last week in court filings. James Biden, 75, has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing and has sought to distance himself from Langston, whose father Joey Langston also was associated with the first brother. Keaton Langston founded Fountain Health, a lab company, in May 2017 and offered its services to rural hospital operator Americore Health, which later went bankrupt. Records show James Biden was involved with Fountain Health in 2017 before connecting with Americore, which provided him in $600,000 in loans in 2018 as he allegedly vowed to use his political connections to secure foreign investors . James passed $200,000 of the funds to Joe Biden in an alleged loan repayment. Shortly after the lab firm launched, Joey Langston emailed James Biden and his son Keaton and three others on July 12, 2017, about an upcoming “meeting for Fountain Health partners,” Politico reported in February. “Jim will report to the group the results of his discussions earlier today with a contact at [Blue Cross Blue Shield],” the elder Langston wrote. “There will also be discussion about how to proceed with the Union contacts that have been made by Jim and Keaton, within the last two weeks.” Paul Fishman, an attorney for James Biden, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but previously said his client “conducted himself ethically and honorably in all his business dealings.” Keaton Langston agreed in September to repay Americore $240,000 in a civil settlement. James Biden agreed in 2022 to repay Americore $350,000 . The Bidens and the Langstons have been linked financially for years. The elder Langston hosted fundraisers for Joe Biden when he was a senator, ProPublica reported . Joey Langston also loaned James Biden $800,000 , with most of the installments coming toward the end of the Obama-Biden administration in 2016, and ended up only being repaid $400,000 of the amount, he told House impeachment investigators in February. The wealthy Mississippi lawyer pleaded guilty in 2008 and was sentenced to three years in federal prison for being part of a plot to bribe a judge in an asbestos legal fees dispute. He was seeking to overturn his conviction when he made loans to the then-vice president’s son. Joey Langston’s alleged co-conspirator in the bribes case, attorney Dickie Scruggs, was involved in a second prosecution for attempting to bribe a different judge. James Biden was wiretapped by the FBI in 2007 as part of its investigation of the second bribery case, the Washington Post reported in December. James was in talks at the time with Scruggs and conspirator Tim Balducci about setting up a law firm that would have employed himself, his nephew Hunter Biden and James’ wife Sara. Then-Sen. Biden went from an opponent of federal legislation to sanction tobacco companies for lying about the addictiveness of cigarettes to a supporter after Scruggs — who planned a multibillion-dollar lawsuit — paid James Biden’s lobbying firm $100,000 in 1998, the Washington Post reported. “I probably wouldn’t have hired him if he wasn’t the senator’s brother,” Scruggs told the paper. Morning Report and Evening Update: Your source for today's top stories Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy . Never miss a story. Scruggs also flew Joe Biden to a fundraiser on his private plane, the Washington Post reported. Joe Biden has consistently claimed he “never” discussed business with his son or brother and said in December and again in March that he “did not” interact with their partners, including foreign associates in countries where he held sway as vice president. Evidence including photos, emails and witness statements indicate that Biden actually interacted with his son and brother’s associates from two Chinese government-linked business ventures and their patrons from Kazakhstan , Mexico , Russia and Ukraine . James Biden was a partner with first son Hunter in many ventures and allegedly wasn’t always coy about the angle he was pushing to investors. “We’ve got people all around the world who want to invest in Joe Biden,” James allegedly said in the early 2000s as he and Hunter were in the process of acquiring investment bank Paradigm , according to a 2021 book by Politico reporter Ben Schreckinger.",

        "description": "Kristie Pereira, 32, made the difficult decision to have her puppy Beau put down after vets said he was suffering from a neurological problem that couldn't be cured.",
        "content": "In a heart-wrenching incident, a distraught dog-owner found that her much-loved pet was up for adoption nearly a year after she had made the painful decision to put him down. Kristie Pereira, 32, received a devastating prognosis for her puppy Beau from a veterinarian who suggested the pup was dealing with an incurable neurological issue predicted only to worsen over time. However, Kristie was stunned to discover him listed on the website of the pet rescue center where Beau was initially adopted, almost a year after she'd painfully decided to euthanize him. Police officer shoots and kills blind, deaf dog Teddy in the street Woman has social media in stitches over dog's strange habit Kirstie was dealt a further emotional blow when the center declined to return Beau to her. Overwhelmed with grief, she recounted: \"The person that called me was so rude and just disrespectful and just being really nasty towards me. Just saying that I abandoned him, and that I left him to die. That I never cared about him. I want him back with me.\" In late 2022, Kirstie adopted Beau, then just two months old, at a cost of $450 (£353) from the Lost Dog and Cat Rescue Foundation in Maryland, USA. Soon after adoption, Beau's health issues became evident. Initial blood tests indicated a possible liver condition and Kirstie was furnished with liver enzymes for him. When Beaus condition deteriorated, three veterinarians reached the conclusion that his impaired bowel control and hind leg mobility pointed towards a serious neurological disorder. Kirstie was slammed with a staggering $12,000 bill for tests to diagnose her puppy, Beau, with the vet warning her that there was \"there's a very slim chance of finding what is wrong\" and \"an even smaller chance\" it could be treated. After discussions with the Lost Dog and Cat Rescue team, she made the tough call to euthanize Beau, believing it to be the kindest option. Living in San Antonio, Texas, Kirstie recounted, \"After I talked to them is really when I felt that I was going to be doing the right thing by putting him down.\" \"They really gave me that support and that encouragement that, although it's hard, sometimes that's the best thing to do.\" In a heartbreaking twist, Kirstie paid just $15 for Beau's euthanasia in March last year, under the shelter's policy which prohibits owners from being present during the procedure. However, during a recent trip to Maryland to visit her mother, Kirstie was shocked to find Beau alive on the rescue's website, now healthier and larger but still recognizable by his unique markings and the name Amos Hart given by the shelter, a nod to the musical \"Chicago\". The rescue center's vets had apparently found no neurological issues and instead treated a liver condition with a $7,000 (£5493) surgery funded by GoFundMe, after which Beau was declared healthy. Kirstie, who claims she was kept in the dark about these developments, has since offered to cover the $7,000 surgery cost to reclaim Beau. Chloe Floyd, a spokesperson for the rescue, stood by their decision not to return the dog to Kirstie. She stated: \"LDCRF does not re-home an owner-surrendered dog with its former owner. Our mission is to save adoptable and safe-to-the-community dogs from euthanasia.\"",

        "description": "The Oakland Athletics and Tampa Bay Rays meet for the first time this season Tuesday night at the start of a three-game series at St. Petersburg, Fla., that matches a pair of clubs trending in opposite directions.",
        "content": "The Oakland Athletics and Tampa Bay Rays meet for the first time this season Tuesday night at the start of a three-game series at St. Petersburg, Fla., that matches a pair of clubs trending in opposite directions. In Oakland's 112-loss campaign in 2023, not much went right on or off the field. This season, though, manager Mark Kotsay's club is playing much better baseball and is out of last place, at least for the time being. Last week, during a six-game homestand, the American League West's fourth-place team split its six games and two series, taking two of three from the Colorado Rockies before dropping two against the Houston Astros. In Sunday's 5-2 setback in the home finale, shortstop Max Schuemann bobbled an easy two-out grounder in the fourth inning, committing two errors on the play and watching five runs (four unearned) cross the plate as the Astros went on to win the series. Kotsay said key miscues hampered his group in both defeats against Houston. \"The play is made and it's a one-run game,\" Kotsay said of Schuemann's gaffe. \"It really impacted the game. Physical errors are going to happen. Nobody is trying to go out there and make an error. Max has played a good shortstop. ... You look back on Friday's loss, we had one (bad) inning. Today, we had one inning that let the game slip away from us.\" Like the A's, Tampa Bay finds itself near the bottom of its division -- fourth in the AL East, leading only the struggling Toronto Blue Jays. Injuries have played a role in the Rays' struggles. Against Kansas City on Sunday, Brandon Lowe hit a three-run triple that helped the Rays earn a 4-1 victory to salvage the final game of the series. During their struggles this season, the Rays are finding it hard to win at home, which has not been the case during manager Kevin Cash's tenure. Entering the season, the AL East squad had a reputation for defending its turf and playing 8 1/2-inning games. Since the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, the Rays held a 176-96 mark (.647 winning percentage) at home, but this year's struggles have led to a 15-17 record including 1-5 on the current nine-game homestand. \"We're not getting it done,\" Cash said. \"Every facet of it. I mean, we're expanding on pitches that we probably can't handle. The pitches we can handle, we're not doing any damage with. We're not able to piece too much together right now. So I mean, it's kind of all-encompassing.\" In his 11th start, Rays right-hander Zack Littell (2-2, 3.42 ERA) will take the ball in the series opener. It is the first of seven matchups with the A's this season. Littell's last two starts were no-decisions against the Boston Red Sox when he combined to allow six earned runs in 10 2/3 innings with two homers. Over nine career appearances against the A's, all in relief, the right-hander is 0-0 with a 4.00 ERA. Oakland is expected to start rookie right-hander Mitch Spence (3-2, 4.09) for the first game of its six-game road trip.

        "content": "was all smiles when . The TV personality, , beamed from ear to ear as he returned to his Britain’s Got Talent presenting duties alongside close pal Declan Donnelly. The duo, who looked suave in matching navy blue three piece suits, reunited on Monday, 27 May for the first of this year’s Britain’s Got Talent live semi-final shows at the Hammersmith Apollo in London. Fans at home welcomed 48 year old Ant’s return to work with open arms and many took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to praise the TV presenter’s appearance on the ITV show. “Simon congratulating ant becoming a dad and the birth of his baby boy and he’s happy for him #BGT #Britainsgottalent,” wrote one. “Ant's first time on live TV since the birth of his child and he's happier than ever #BGT,” another added. “Simon saying congrats to ant and him having the biggest smile my heart #bgt,” wrote a third. Ant’s return to work comes just days after after welcoming Wilder into the world. As he greeted the monarch, 48 year old Dec explained that co-host Ant was unable to be at Buckingham Palace himself because he was on parenting duties - and part of that meant feeding his son. As he apologised to King Charles for his pal’s absence at the event for The Prince’s Trust, Dec, who attended the event with wife Ali Astall, joked that he “broke royal protocol” as he gave an update about his pal. After meeting the King, Dec admitted that he may have made a faux paus. He said: “I passed on Ant's apology that he couldn't be here today because he was at home breastfeeding.” With a laugh, he continued: “I don't know whether I broke royal protocol by giving that information.” The Prince’s Trust reception allowed the monarch to interact with winners of the Prince's Trust Awards as well as celebrities including Martin Freeman, Pixie Lott and Ellie Simmonds who presented awards. Speaking about the award winners, Dec said: “All the young people behind us here, some incredible stories again about people getting their life on track and making a real difference to their communities, and some incredible stories yet again.”",

The Pune Police on Monday submitted its enquiry report in a court stating there is prima facie truth in the complaint filed against Rahul Gandhi by V D Savarkar's grand nephew who had accused the Congress leader of defaming the Hindutva ideologue in a speech made in London in 2023.",
        "content": "Pune, May 27 (PTI) The Pune Police on Monday submitted its enquiry report in a court stating there is prima facie truth in the complaint filed against Rahul Gandhi by V D Savarkar's grand nephew who had accused the Congress leader of defaming the Hindutva ideologue in a speech made in London in 2023. The report was submitted in the court of judicial magistrate (first class) Akshi Jain, said advocate Sangram Kolhatkar, who represents Satyaki Ashok Savarkar, the complainant. Kolhatkar said the court may issue a notice to Rahul Gandhi seeking his appearance. Satyaki Savarkar had said his lawyers moved the city court with a complaint under sections 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code last April. The court had asked the Vishrambaug police to verify the proof submitted by Satyaki and submit a report by May 27. \"Vishrambaug police stated that Satyaki Savarkar had filed a complaint in the court last April accusing Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of making false claims about the late revolutionary (V D Savarkar) in a speech made in London in March 2023,\" said Kolhatkar. As per the complaint, Rahul Gandhi claimed in his speech that V D Savarkar had written in a book that he and five to six of his friends once beat up a Muslim man and he (Savarkar) felt happy. Satyaki Savarkar had said that no such incident had ever taken place, and V D Savarkar never wrote any such thing anywhere, the complaint stated, terming Rahul Gandhi's allegation as fictitious, false and malicious. \"The Vishrambaug police submitted a report today before the court and told the court that in their probe, it has been revealed that V D Savarkar had not written about such incident in any of his books but despite that Gandhi made that kind of remarks during his speech in London in March 2023 and defamed Savarkar,\" said Kolhatkar. Police stated that prima facie there is a truth in the complaint filed by Satyaki Savarkar that Rahul Gandhi had defamed V D Savarkar in his speech. When contacted Tukaram Nimbalkar, assistant police inspector, confirmed that the report had been submitted in the court. Notably, a metropolitan court in Surat last March convicted Rahul Gandhi of criminal defamation for his 2019 remark, \"How come all thieves have Modi as the common surname?\", and sentenced him to two years in jail. Subsequently, the sessions court granted him bail on April 3. The Supreme Court in August stayed his conviction in the defamation case.",

        "content": "A Massachusetts man was arrested Saturday in connection with two stabbings Saturday. Jared Ravizza, 26, of Chilmark on Martha’s Vineyard was arrested after the Porsche he was driving crashed, according to the . The crash followed an unsuccessful attempt by police to pull over Ravizza after two people were stabbed Saturday night at a McDonald’s in Plymouth, the outlet reported. The McDonald’s came after four girls between the ages of 9 and 17 were stabbed in a Braintree movie theater. Police believe the incidents are related. : Police are blocking off, shutting down the AMC in Braintree after a reported stabbing. We spoke with an employee who said multiple people were stabbed in a theater tonight. Several people reportedly rushed away by ambulance. More details to come. — Daniel Coates (@danielcoates_25) The X account identified Ravizza as a “trans activist.” An account that appeared to belong to the suspect said he is an artist who uses the pronoun “she.” A 2021 report in indicated that Ravizza was active in counseling people with disabilities. The Plymouth County District Attorney’s Office said he was arrested in Sandwich around 7:15 p.m. after the Porsche accident. Earlier, a McDonald’s employee was after a customer reached in through the drive-thru window and grabbed him, the Times reported. The suspect then stabbed a 21-year-old woman working at the McDonald’s. “Preliminary investigation suggests a likely connection to an earlier incident at a movie theatre in Braintree resulting in non-life threatening injuries to four juveniles,” the Massachusetts State Police said in a statement. According to the Times, Ravizza will arraigned in Plymouth District Court on Tuesday on charges of assault with intent to murder and two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. Those charges refer only to the McDonald’s incidents. The man who attacked the girls at the movie theater was “laughing the whole time,” Lisa Dembowski, the mother of three girls who were stabbed, told in Boston. Massachusetts stabbing spree suspect Jared Ravizza was ‘laughing’ during movie theater attack, mom says — Fox News (@FoxNews) “They had just sat down, they had just got their concessions. I guess he came up behind them, they were in like the second row,” she said. “He came up behind them. My oldest was leaned over to get something, he got her in the back. My other daughter in the chest. My last daughter across her arm.” Dembowski said the man stabbed their friend and left. She said the girls were . “They don’t want to go to the movies ever again,” Dembowski said. “Shaken up. They are physically fine. Kids are resilient. But I think they are terrified that they could just go to a movie on a Saturday night, and this could happen. Someone could just walk into a movie theater and someone could do this.” Dembowski said children face too many risks. “More and more this is happening, and it makes parents sick to bring their kids anywhere, or let them go anywhere without them. I absolutely feel that way,” she said. “I hope he gets what he deserves. I understand mental health. I’m a counselor. I understand it. I think it’s a pretty sick individual to harm children,” she said. Plymouth District Attorney Timothy Cruz said Ravizza was wanted for unspecified “other incidents,” according to . State Police in Connecticut reported a fatal stabbing Saturday and said the suspect was in custody in Massachusetts. We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.",

        "description": "After his French Open first round exit Rafael Nadal has indicated he will not be playing at Wimbledon, focusing instead on a return to Paris for the Olympics.",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal has pledged to carry on playing as long as he is enjoying his tennis, despite a first round exit at Roland Garros at the slam he made his own, but strongly hinted he will not be playing at Wimbledon this year. Nadal said the rigours of switching to grass for the London showpiece, then reverting to clay for the Paris Olympics, would probably be too demanding given his age and recent injury issues. The 22-time grand slam champion lost in straight sets to No.4 Alexander Zverev on Monday - but showed enough flashes of brilliance to suggest he would have beaten most opponents. Having only recently returned from a near 18-month absence that has encouraged him to keep going - and to target more gold. Nadal won singles gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and doubles gold at Rio 2016. That this year's tennis tournament will be on his favourite court, where he won 14 French Open singles titles, has further tempted him. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. However, that does mean Wimbledon, where he won in 2008 and 2010, is likely to be sacrificed. He has only competed in SW19 once in the last four years - in 2022 when he had to withdraw through injury ahead of his semi-final with Nick Kyrgios. \"It looks difficult, honestly, to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,\" said Nadal. \"I'm booked in Wimbledon because I had to, [but] I don't think it's a positive idea right now. \"I need to talk with the team. I need to analyse so many facts. But I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back to clay.\" Nadal, 38 next week, missed most of 2023 with a hip problem and this year's comeback was hampered by a muscle tear, then a series of minor issues affected his Paris preparation. \"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect. I wake up one day and I find a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,\" Nadal added. \"I've been fighting with all the things that I went through. But the dynamic is positive the last few weeks. I felt ready. I think tomorrow I'll be ready to play again if I have to. But I will not have to. \"Now, I need to prepare myself, I need to clear my ideas and see what's the new calendar to try to be ready for Olympics. My main goal now is to play the Olympics.\" Longer term, sounding much like his old friend and rival Andy Murray who also lost in the first round in Paris, he said he wanted to carry on playing while he was healthy and having fun. And even in defeat on the clay where he had so rarely lost before, he had fun. \"If it's the last time that I played here,\" Nadal said, \"I am at peace with myself.\"",

Now the parents have come under fire after the father publicly slapped his toddler in the face. The parents, Malcolm and Simone Collins, told BI they think the backlash is overstated — and racist.

Advertisement Remember the American couple who's following in the steps of the ultra-rich people who want to repopulate the world with their children? Now they're in hot water after publicly smacking one of their kids. Malcolm and Simone Collins previously told Business Insider that they're on a mission to have a litter of children because, as pronatalists, they want to \"set the future of our species.\" This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . \"I do not think humanity is in a great situation right now. And I think if somebody doesn't fix the problem, we could be gone,\" Malcolm Collins previously told BI in 2022. The couple has done several interviews with the press in an effort to explain their objectives as a couple and speak on behalf of a burgeoning pronatalist movement . Advertisement But a recent interview the couple gave to The Guardian is getting a bad reception. The Guardian described a scene when Malcolm Collins slapped one of his toddlers in public after the child \"knocked the table with his foot and caused it to teeter, to almost topple, before it rights itself.\" \"Immediately – like a reflex – Malcolm hits him in the face,\" The Guardian's Jenny Kleeman wrote. \"It is not a heavy blow, but it is a slap with the palm of his hand direct to his two-year-old son's face that's firm enough for me to hear on my voice recorder when I play it back later. And Malcolm has done it in the middle of a public place, in front of a journalist, who he knows is recording everything.\" Malcolm Collins resumed his conversation with the stunned reporter after telling his child: \"I love you but you gotta be nice in restaurants. No, Toastie. You're going to get bopped if you do that.\" Related stories Soon afterward, the episode went viral on X — the platform owned by Elon Musk, whom Malcolm Collins was incidentally gushing over moments before striking his toddler. Advertisement \"The pro-natalist couple hits their children,\" one X user said, sharing a screenshot of the article. \"Jesus Christ the kid is two!!!! My kid is two!!!! The idea of hitting her has simply never occurred to me and if you know any two-year-olds it should be obvious how obviously nuts it is to do this!!!!\" another shared on X . In an email to Business Insider, Simone Collins said the toddler, named Torsten Savage, was intentionally acting out, and tipping over a table with glassware on top of it \"could be deadly in a house with infants\" if it were to happen at the couple's Pennsylvania home. \"He is an incredibly sweet, smart, analytic kid, but he also has a major rebellious streak and is in the middle of his twos. This is all to say that yes, 100%, Torsten was pushing boundaries and not acting unintentionally,\" Simone Collins wrote. \"Incidents in which we 'bop' our kids are unusual—usually when physical safety is at stake.\" Advertisement Over the phone, Malcolm Collins told Business Insider that he \"bopped\" his son on the nose to jar him, not to hurt him. The couple chose the punishment specifically after observing \"animal parenting models,\" he said. \"Basically, across the nose is what we aim for,\" Malcolm Collins said. \"The reason I think it's better than a slap on the wrist is because it doesn't need to be painful to have the same impact. By that, what I mean is when somebody enters the space around your face, it is very shocking and very reorienting, especially if you're in an emotional loop, which is easy for kids to get into.\" He added: \"The only way you could achieve the same effect by hitting a child's wrist is to hit it large enough to cause a significant amount of pain, which I wouldn't want to do, but I can understand why visually people might be, 'Oh, the slight hit on the nose or the face is really bad' because it looks visually bad.\" The couple both said they found the backlash they faced on social media to be racist since, they argued, minorities often hit their children without the same backlash. Advertisement \"We are kind of shocked by the racism threaded throughout this recent controversy. It is pretty well-documented that African Americans and other minority groups practice corporal punishment much more than other groups,\" Simone Collins said via email, linking to a CNN article published in 2011. Malcolm Collins said it was \"uniquely offensive\" to him considering \"the majority of Americans practice some form of corporal punishment, as you can see from the statistics with specifically that being the minority groups of Americans. So yeah, I think it's an arguably racist position.\"",

        "description": "Created by The Viral Fever, Panchayat S3 is a comic satire series, directed by Deepak Kumar Mishra. Having premiered on Prime Video on May 27, the series has become an unfortunate victim of piracy.",
        "content": ", one of TVF (The Viral Fever)'s most popular shows, is also one of Amazon Prime Video's most followed Indian shows. A satirical comedy series, Panchayat follows the journey of engineering graduate Abhishek, who, unable to find a better job, becomes the secretary of a Panchayat office in a remote Uttar Pradesh village. Created by Chandan Kumar and directed by Deepak Kumar Mishra, the first season of premiered on April 3, 2020, followed by the second season on May 20, 2022. The much-anticipated third season has now premiered on May 27, 2024. The series stars Jitendra Kumar, Raghubir Yadav, Neena Gupta, Sanvikaa, Chandan Roy, Durgesh Kumar, Ashok Pathak, Faisal Malik, and Sunita Rajwar. In season 3, the plot thickens with the arrival of a new secretary and the protagonists' clash with the local MLA. Unfortunately, the new season was pirated on its release day, with reports indicating that season 3 was leaked on torrent sites such as MovieRulz, Tamilrockers, 1337x, and Telegram channels in high-definition format. This incident is part of a growing trend where movies and shows are quickly pirated upon release, despite efforts to combat these illegal activities. Even with previous attempts to block these sites and enforce restrictions, they persist, enabling the spread of piracy. Cybercrime authorities must take stronger actions against these platforms. . Returning to S3, director Deepak Kumar Mishra, who is also one of the writers, shares insights on how the story connects seamlessly with the previous seasons, ensuring long-term audience engagement. Mishra hints at spoilers, discussing how Neena Gupta’s character, Pradhan ji, faces a challenge to her position, adding an intriguing twist to the series.",

        "description": "A nation-wide moving company that threatened to drive away with a Chilliwack, B.C., couple’s furniture, has compensated the customers nearly $1,000.",
        "content": "A nation-wide moving company that threatened to drive away with a Chilliwack, B.C., couple’s furniture, has compensated the customers nearly $1,000. In early May, Kim Jans and her husband hired Let’s Get Moving to help them move from South Surrey to their new home in Chilliwack, based on excellent feedback on the company’s website. “The reviews were absolutely fabulous,” said Jans. The couple had already moved a lot of their belongings themselves using a U-Haul, and all that was left were about 30 boxes and the heavy furniture from a two-bedroom home. Jans ordered a 26-foot truck with three workers, for $229 an hour. But on a moving day, the wrong truck arrived, one Jans figured was too small to fit all of their furniture. It took another two hours for the right one to arrive. “In the meantime, they kept loading up the wrong truck, and I kept saying to the workers ‘please stop,'” Jans told CTV News. Then she said it took the movers about five hours to load the right truck, almost twice as long as she expected. “I could just see them standing inside the truck, just standing there chatting,” she said. But the most alarming moment for the couple, came when the movers got to the couple’s new home. The workers stopped unloading the truck before it was completely empty, and presented the couple with a bill. The grand total read $3,486.53, and was about a $1,000, or four hours more than they anticipated. She said the movers wouldn’t unload the rest of the furniture, until they paid up. “When we challenged the bill, they pretty much said, ‘no this is the bill, this is the amount, and you need to pay it, or we're going to drive away with the remaining items that are in the truck,'” Jans recounted. “They hold you hostage once they get your property in their truck. You are completely held hostage,” she said. The couple felt they had no choice, and paid the bill on the spot. They filed an official complaint with Let’s Get Moving, and although the company responded almost immediately, they couldn’t agree on compensation. But when CTV News asked Let’s Get Moving for comment, Jans heard from the owner of the South Surrey franchise a few hours later. “I am deeply sorry for the mistakes that occurred,” read the email from Daniil Sychev. He also followed up with a phone call, and offered to refund the couple $961.80 for a move that he agreed “should've been done a little bit faster.” Jans found him sincere, and accepted the compensation. Sychev confirmed some movers will be getting more training, and at least one is no longer with the company. From the head office in Toronto, Let’s Get Moving representatives told CTV News that it is running a good company with excellent service and that “90 per cent of customers are very, very pleased with us.” They acknowledged that in order to get paid, movers have refused to unload furniture in the past, but that it is not company policy. “That should never happen,” said customer representative, Kelvin Anil. What remains is a settlement agreement that customers are asked to sign when they receive compensation. It states that they are not allowed to say or post any negative comments about Let’s Get Moving or “the customer specifically and IRREVOCABLY agrees to pay the company liquidated damages in the amount of $5,000.” In the end, Jans did not have to sign.",

        "content": "Watch the trailer for NCIS' Ducky tribute episode WARNING: This article contains spoilers from NCIS. NCIS season 22 will follow-up on that cliffhanger ending which put Jimmy and Jessica’s relationship in jeopardy. When season 21 ended earlier this month, Jessica Knight (played by Katrina Law) was offered a promotion working as the new REACT chief training officer at Camp Pendleton. This meant that she would have to relocate to the other side of the country and following a particularly terrifying mission, she decided to take it. Her relationship with Jimmy Palmer (Brian Dietzen) has been a little shaky as of late and this could be the final nail in the coffin if they decide long distance won’t work for them. And now a CBS viewer has shared that this could open a door for Jimmy to get himself a new girlfriend. Read more: NCIS season 22 could see Agent Sam Hanna take over from Jessica Knight NCIS season 22 to see Jimmy find ‘someone else’ as fan predicts end of him and Jessica. (Image: CBS) Sharing their theory with the Reddit community, they wrote: “I believe that Palmer will find someone elsewhere at the office, and Jess comes back on a case to find out Palmer moved on.” They went on to add that Jessica would be “distraught” at the thought of Jimmy falling in love with someone else “but would come to accept it” if she did choose to return. If season 22 is going to start with Jessica leaving the team, then her spot as an agent would need to be filled, meaning a potential new cast member. Jessica’s particular role has always been filled in by a feisty female agent as well, from Caitlin “Kate” Todd (Sasha Alexander) and Ziva David (Cote de Pablo), to Ellie Bishop (Emily Wickersham).

(Image: CBS) So could it be that Jimmy will find himself in a relationship with Jessica’s replacement in season 22? Even though this theory is plausible, not everyone on Reddit seemed to be on board with the idea. In response, a fellow viewer wrote: “First NO Jess will not leave all is a plot and cliffhanger out of storyline. “Somewhere Nick will ask her ‘Are you sure? You got us and you have a family and [are] a step-mum to Victoria!’ And no Jimmy will not find someone else like people think!” Trending SUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Find out how to watch Disney+ for free. NCIS was renewed for season 22 at the end of April with the show predicted to return sometime in September. Series 21 was the shortest outing yet for the police procedural with just 10 episodes thanks to the Hollywood actors and writers’ strikes. Season 22, however, is expected to consist of around 24 episodes, which is roughly how long each NCIS series lasts for. NCIS is available to watch on CBS and Disney+.

        "description": "Coronation Street fans are convinced Sarah Barlow will lock lips with another resident on the famous ITV cobbles after she made friends with a hunky new resident",
        "content": "fans are convinced they have worked out who Sarah Barlow will fall into bed with next on the cobbles. Over the past years, the blonde bombshell’s (played by Tina O’Brien) love life has been following her separation from her husband Adam Barlow. The couple separated after she dated and fell pregnant with TV bad boy Damon Hay (Ciaran Griffiths) behind his back. After he discovered her infidelity, the couple separated with the solicitor demanding a divorce. Since then, she has had an on-off relationship with Gary Windass behind his partner Maria Connor’s back. But viewers believe the TV favourite may have set her eyes on another resident in the village. During Monday’s visit (May 27) to the ITV cobbles, Sarah was caught red-handed trying to plant evidence that could get her daughter Bethany Platt’s assailant arrested for her murder. At the start of the episode, Nathan Curtis (Chris Harper) drove past the journalist, breaking her restraining order on him. But the builder argued that he didn’t break her order because he believed she still lived in London. When Bethany reported him to the police, PC Craig Tinker confirmed that there was nothing they could do. It was at this point that Sarah decided to take matters into her own hands when she found one of Lauren’s bobbles in the Barlow family home, wrapped in strands of her hair. As she stormed over to the builder’s yard, the doting mum was caught red handed by new detective Kit Green moments before she hid the evidence. Thankfully, the newcomer was kind to the heartbroken mum and let her off with a warning as they had a heart-to-heart in his car. Before he let her go, he swiped the incriminating evidence as she insisted that Nathan was responsible for Lauren’s murder. Later on in the episode, Sarah checked in on her daughter, but her day quickly turned around for the better. Just as Sarah brought Bethany in for a comforting hug, her boyfriend Daniel Osbourne announced that her assailant had been arrested and taken away in handcuffs. It was at this point that fans flooded to X – formerly known as Twitter – to share their suspicions online. Many are convinced that Sarah will fall in love with the hunky new detective on the street in a matter of days. One user penned: “How long till Sarah starts making her bedroom eyes at Bernie’s son [cry0laughing emoji] #Corrie.” Another agreed: “I loved Adam/ Sarah together but... I like Kit & Sarah together... #corrie.” A third echoed: “Sarah will end up bedding Kit... I can sense it #Corrie” as a fourth chimed in with: “Is this the start of Sarah and the copper getting it on keep on watching [shifty eyes emoji, cry-laughing emoji] #corrie.”",

        "description": "“We can't forget about the victims. Even though he wasn't charged with all of them, we can't forget about all the other women that he wasn't charged with.\"",
        "content": "As convicted serial killer Robert Pickton clings to life in Quebec after being stabbed by a fellow inmate, family members of one of his Edmonton area victims wait for justice — and for answers. “I want to feel like it’s completely closed, and I have a feeling ... the whole truth is not out yet,” said Kristina Batemen, daughter of Pickton victim Georgina Papin , who was from the Enoch Cree First Nation, bordering Edmonton’s western edge . Although he was convicted in 2007 for the deaths of six women, Pickton once bragged to an undercover cop that he had killed 49 women. The remains or DNA of 33 women were found on Pickton’s pig farm in Port Coquitlam, B.C. Georgina Papin’s remains were discovered at the Pickton farm in July 2002. Stabbed a week ago with a broken-off broom handle wielded by another inmate at the maximum-security Port-Cartier Institution, Pickton lay in an induced coma in a Quebec hospital as doctors weighed whether to wake him up to see if he could survive. Bateman, who lives in Las Vegas, is party to one of several ongoing lawsuits filed by Vancouver lawyer Jason Gratl against Pickton and his brother, David Pickton, by family members of victims . Like her lawyer, Bateman believes Pickton had an accomplice. “He mentioned to authorities that other people were involved — investigators should still be looking into the allegations. I don’t feel like justice has been served completely,” said Bateman. “And I’m still going to always be trying to find the truth — more of the truth.” Gratl, representing family members of victims in nine lawsuits against the Pickton brothers, has said the potential death of the killer would have no bearing on proceedings. “Robert William Pickton’s state of health or well-being — I don’t anticipate it will have any significant effect on the progress of the civil trial,” he told The Canadian Press. A B.C. Supreme Court hearing is scheduled for June 26 to hear applications for standing in the RCMP’s bid to dispose of 14,000 pieces of evidence, mostly collected during the 18-month-long search of Pickton’s farm in 2002 and 2003. Gratl said a bigger issue than whether Pickton survives is the potential destruction of the evidence. “I act as legal counsel for 16 children of nine women who were killed by Robert Pickton,” he said. “It’s in their interest to preserve the evidence seized by the RCMP on the Pickton farm to allow my clients to prove that Robert Pickton and David Pickton caused them to suffer loss.” In 2014, the botched investigation into Pickton resulted in a settlement of $50,000 for the victims’ children who had sued all three levels of government and the RCMP. Gratl said statements by the defence, Crown and jury also “strongly suggest a shared belief that he did not act alone and others may be implicated in the deaths of the six women Robert Pickton was convicted of killing.” Bateman was raised in Las Vegas by her father’s side of the family, but was close to her mother, and stays in touch with her other surviving seven siblings, the children of Georgina Papin. She believes that what goes around is coming around for Pickton. “Karma was definitely involved. For evil people that do things like what he did, I think he definitely deserved it,” Bateman said. “We can’t forget about the victims. Even though he wasn’t charged with all of them, we can’t forget about all the other women that he wasn’t charged with.” Had she lived, Georgina Papin would have turned 60 on March 11. “I know she’d have been a great grandmother,” Bateman said, wistful for her two children who never got to know their grandmother. “We talk about her every day, like she’s still in our lives. And we sing happy birthday to her every year.” Yvette Papin was raised with her cousin, Georgina Papin, spending many happy hours with their mutual grandmother. She remembers Georgina as sweet and loving, a woman who put others first. “Georgina never had any issues with anybody at all, not even a fight or an argument. That’s just how beautiful and sweet she was,” she said. Listening to accounts of the attack that left Pickton near death, Yvette finds herself torn. “A part of me was sad but a part of me was happy — it just kind of triggered a lot of mixed emotions on what their siblings, the children are going through,” Yvette Papin said. Pickton deserves to suffer for all the suffering he caused others, she said. “I don’t wish this upon anyone, but it was expected to turn around and come back to him eventually. I don’t think he’s suffering enough. Don’t get me wrong — I don’t wish suffering on anyone, but what the women went through — I can’t imagine. I will not imagine just what they had to endure before they passed away,” she said. “This is a lot of trauma not only to the families, but to the investigators,” Yvette Papin said. “What he got was nothing compared to what he’s done to the women.” jcarmichael@postmedia.com",

        "content": "An updated weather alert was issued by the National Weather Service on Monday at 3:52 p.m. for strong thunderstorms until 4:30 p.m. for St. Lawrence and Franklin counties. Expect pea-sized hail (0.25 inches) and wind gusts of up to 50 mph. \"At 3:51 p.m., Doppler radar tracked a strong thunderstorm 12 miles southwest of Horseshoe Lake, moving northeast at 50 mph,\" according to the weather service. \"Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects. Minor hail damage to vegetation is possible.\" Locations impacted by the alert include Tupper Lake, Oswegatchie, Piercefield, Carry Falls Reservoir, Wawbeek, Horseshoe Lake, Cranberry Lake, Lake Ozonia, Star Lake, Stark, Lower Oswegatchie, Aldrich, Conifer, Saranac Inn, Wanakena, St. Regis Mountain, Gale, Newton Falls, Childwold and Shurtleff. The weather service comments, \"If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building. Frequent cloud to ground lightning is occurring with this storm. Lightning can strike 10 miles away from a thunderstorm. Seek a safe shelter inside a building or vehicle. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch remains in effect until 9 p.m. for northern New York.\" Lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times each year, with the bulk of these electrical discharges occurring during the summer months. Tragically, lightning claims the lives of about 20 individuals annually, as reported by the weather service. The risk of lightning-related incidents escalates as thunderstorms draw near, reaching its peak when the storm directly looms overhead. However, it gradually recedes as the tempest moves away. To protect yourself during a thunderstorm, take these recommendations into consideration: 1. Lightning safety plan: 2. Indoors safety measures: 3. Wait for the all-clear: When indoor shelter isn't available: If you find yourself outdoors with no access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety: In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, preparedness and vigilance are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of lightning-related incidents and prioritize your safety. When heavy rain pours, the risk of flooding and treacherous roads rises. Here's your guide from the weather service to staying safe during downpours: Beware of rapid water flow: Maintain safe driving distances: Reduce speed and drive cautiously: Choose your lane wisely: Visibility matters: Watch out for slippery roads: Keep a safe distance from large vehicles: Mind your windshield wipers: By following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down.

        "content": "The royal family is sending their condolences. Prince William and Kate Middleton honored the death of Mark Long , a British Royal Air Force (RAF) pilot who crashed while flying a World War II-era Spitfire plane on May 25. \"Incredibly sad to hear of the news this afternoon from RAF Coningsby,\" the couple shared on X , formerly known as Twitter, the same day. \"Our thoughts this evening are with the pilot's loved ones, the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, and the wider RAF family.\" Mark's death was confirmed by Group Captain Robbie Lees , who called the pilot a \"great friend, colleague, and a passionate, professional aviator.\" \"An investigation into the cause of this tragic event has now begun,\" the May 26 statement explained . \"The RAF will not be offering any comment on the accident until that investigation has concluded, and likewise, we ask others not to speculate.\" \"I would like to extend a sincere thank you to the RAF personnel and our emergency services colleagues who responded so swiftly yesterday,\" the message continued. \"Our thoughts remain with Mark's family and friends to whom we offer our deepest sympathies. We ask that their privacy be respected at this tragic and shocking time.\" The Spitfire is the most famous British fighter aircraft in history, according to the Royal Air Force Museum . It became a symbol of freedom in the summer of 1940 when it was used against German air attacks during the Battle of Britain. And it's no surprise that Kate and William professed their love and grief for the late pilot. The couple—who share kids Prince George , 10, Princess Charlotte , 9, and Prince Louis , 6—is deeply involved with the RAF. In fact, King Charles III bestowed William with the title Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps earlier this month, a title the monarch held for 30 years. Kate—who's been out of the spotlight recently after being diagnosed with cancer—was also given a new title when taking over her husband's previous role as Honorary Air Commandant Royal Air Force Coningsby in August. Now, read on to keep up-to-date with the royals. Nearly two months after the Princess of Wales went public with her cancer diagnosis, a spokesperson for Kensington Palace said the royal has no immidiate plans to return to her public-facing duties . \"The princess is not expected to return to work,\" the rep said in a May 21 statement to BBC, \"until it's cleared by her medical team.\" On May 13, King Charles III bestowed the title of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to his oldest son, sparking controversy as many royal watchers believed the title would be more suited for Prince Harry , who trained and served in the military branch. On April 26, nearly three months after sharing his cancer diagnosis, Buckingham Palace announced that Charles will return to public-facing duties . The queen consort attended the Royal Maundy Service on March 28 in place of King Charles III , making her the first spouse of the Monarch to continue the ancient tradition . In a March 22 video message, the Princess of Wales shared that she'd been diagnosed with cancer after undergoing abdominal surgery in January. \"It was thought that my condition was non-cancerous. The surgery was successful,\" she said before noting that tests after the operation found cancer had been present. \"My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy and I am now in the early stages of that treatment.\" After photo agencies pulled the picture Kensington Palace shared of Kate since having her abdominal surgery on March 10, the Princess of Wales addressed claims the photo was doctored. \"Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing,\" she tweeted on March 11. \"I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused. I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother's Day. C.\" Princess Diana 's niece celebrated Mother's Day in the U.K. by sharing she and her husband Michael Lewis privately welcomed their first baby. “It’s the joy of my life to be your mummy, little one. I love you unconditionally,\" she captioned her March 10 Instagram post . \"Happy Mother’s Day to those who celebrate today.\" After keeping up her full slate of engagements in the wake of her husband's cancer diagnosis, the palace cleared Camilla's schedule. The Times pointed out March 2 that the 76-year-old didn't have any engagements on her calendar until March 11, when she'd be due at Westminster Abbey to observe Commonwealth Day. The husband of Lady Gabriella Windsor and ex-boyfriend of Pippa Middleton , was found dead Feb. 25. Days later, a coroner's inquest found that he died by suicide. While King Charles III was in the hospital for his benign prostate enlargement procedure, the royal family member was diagnosed with cancer . \"His Majesty has today commenced a schedule of regular treatments, during which time he has been advised by doctors to postpone public-facing duties,\" Buckingham Palace said Feb. 5. \"Throughout this period, His Majesty will continue to undertake State business and official paperwork as usual.The King is grateful to his medical team for their swift intervention, which was made possible thanks to his recent hospital procedure. He remains wholly positive about his treatment and looks forward to returning to full public duty as soon as possible.\" The Duchess of York's rep said in a statement on Jan. 21 that Sarah was recently diagnosed with malignant melanoma, an aggressive form of skin cancer. Several months prior, she underwent a single mastectomy to treat breast cancer. On Jan. 14, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark made history as she officially abdicated the throne, handing the crown over to her son, now known as King Frederik the 10th . Kensington Palace announced on Jan. 17 that Kate Middleton underwent planned abdominal surgery and was set to remain in the hospital for 10 to 14 days. \"Based on the current medical advice,\" the Palace said, \"she is unlikely to return to public duties until after Easter.\" Amid Kate's recovery, Prince William postponed a number of engagements as he supported his family, including the couple's three children, Prince George , Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis . Shortly after Kate's hospitalization was made public, Buckingham Palace shared that Charles \"has sought treatment for an enlarged prostate.\" \"His Majesty's condition is benign and he will attend hospital next week for a corrective procedure,\" the statement added. \"The King’s public engagements will be postponed for a short period of recuperation.\" Princess Claire and Prince Felix of Luxembourg welcomed son Balthazar Felix Karl on Jan. 7, the first royal baby of the New Year!",

        "content": "Alabama football has a great opportunity in front of it win a College Football Playoff National Championship. Nick Saban’s decision to retire was probably one of the best things that happened to the Crimson Tide. Alabama gets a fresh reset with Kalen DeBoer and a hunger to prove why it remains the best program in the sport. The Southeastern Conference has done away with divisions and the Tide lost a lot to the NCAA transfer portal, but it should remain in peak position for a national title. Some feel like Alabama will suffer a major setback, but three reason are below on why the Tide win a national title? Jalen Milroe Alabama has one of the best retuning quarterbacks in college football. Jalen Milroe is back with experience and hunger. He carried the Crimson Tide to a Southeastern Conference Championship last season and returned to the CFP. Milroe earned Most Valuable Player honors in the SEC Championship Game, but he finished the 2023 season with 2,834 passing yards, 531 rushing yards, and 35 total touchdowns. The 6-foot-2, 220-pounder has worked this offseason to assure the masses he is a complete player at quarterback. He made huge strides with his passing mechanics in spring practice, and has continued to progress under Yo Murphy and Jordan Palmer training him. Milroe wants every naysayer to know that Alabama is still the measuring stick of college football. His fire, drive, and improvement as a passer should have the Tide winning a national title. Coaching staff has something to prove Kalen DeBoer and his staff want to show they can win in the SEC. They took this opportunity at Alabama for the resources, the competition, and wanting to come behind a legend in Nick Saban. Names such as Nick Sheridan, JaMarcus Shephard, Kane Wommack, Maurice Linguist, Colin Hitschler, and Christian Robinson don’t have the resumes of former assistant coaches for the Tide, but they have the energy, motivation, and teaching skills to This article first appeared on Touchdown Alabama Magazine and was syndicated with permission.",

        "content": "Clothes dipped in toxic have been sent to inmates, says a shock report into a prisoner’s death. Burglar Jamie Tate, 33, was found dead at Strangeways in Manchester in March 2021, after allegedly being supplied with some of the socks. The report by Prisons and Probation Ombudsman Sue McAllister said: “Intelligence suggested prisoners were having clothes sent into them by friends and family that had been soaked in psychoactive substances and then smoking the ripped-up fabric.” A fellow inmate had told his mum to dissolve 50mg fentanyl tablets – an opiate painkiller – in water and soak socks in it. He then gave some to Tate. The report added: “The inmate distributed it on the wing and it had led to prisoners collapsing.” Prison bosses have been warned by Ms McAllister: “More needs to be done to reduce both the supply of, and demand for, psychoactive substances.” A e for allowing inmates to get rid of their most irritating or troublemaking cellmates. The Category B prison, meaning its home to highly dangerous prisoners for whom an escape must be made very difficult, allows fellow cons to kick out misbehaving roommates by way of a vote cast during regular \"wing meetings\". Glendon Prison, in Buckinghamshire, generally only accepts well-behaved cons from other jails. The inmates must then adhere to strict rules and if they fail to do that they can be exiled from the place by their peers, If booted out, they are made to return to the jail they originally came from.",

A “self--inflicted wound” could be to blame if Donald Trump is found guilty in his hush money trial, a former federal prosecutor told the Washington Post . Jim Walden, who is now in private practice, said the former president's constant attacks on the judge in his case — coupled with disrespect from a witness — are likely to backfire when jurors start deliberating this week. \"The thing that I think Trump just doesn't get is, even if you don't like the judge, the jury is going to like the judge,\" Walden said. \"When you're super disrespectful to someone the jury sees as a professional person doing their job, that's a self-inflicted wound. \"Whatever else Donald Trump may be — a great businessman, a great reality TV show host, a great politician — he's a dumb lawyer.” Among major errors in Trump’s defense, Walden said, was calling attorney Robert Costello to the stand. Costello infuriated the judge by rolling his eyes and making snide remarks while being questioned. Judge Juan Merchan’s fury forced him to clear the courtroom to reprimand the witness. \"Costello was a disaster,\" Walden told the Post.

He had a good story to tell, and instead, they put the throttle right back in the prosecutor's hands.\" Trump is facing 34 charges of business fraud involving allegations that he paid adult movie star Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about a sexual relationship the two had.

        "content": "ANT MCPARTLIN may be back at work after just six days of paternity leave, but his baby boy is still evidently on the brain. The Britain's Got Talent show host made a jokey reference to his newborn son while kicking off the semi-finals tonight. He is heading up the live show alongside friend and co-host Declan Donnelly . Eight acts are set to perform tonight, with each of them hoping they have a chance to make it through to the last round of the competition. Two acts from each semi-final this week will make it through to Sunday's grand final – with one decided from a public vote and the second decided by the judges. Ant's wife Anne-Marie Corbett gave birth to their son Wilder Patrick last Tuesday, and the showbiz legend made an allusion to his first child on stage tonight. Dec started reading off a checklist of items supposedly needed for BGT, which included nappies and other baby essentials, before Ant cut in laughing: \"No that's my list!\" He also shared a bit of banter with the panel of judges after Simon paid tribute to the new dad, saying: \"Can i just say congratulations to you Ant, I really am happy for you.\" The TV presenter replied: \"Thank you. thank you very much. Thank you for your lovely gift. Judges - still waiting on yours!\" Dec is said to have been coaching his co-host and best friend through being a dad for the first time. The pair reunited yesterday to host The Prince's Trust Awards at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London. Now they will be introducing audiences to each semi-finalist of the night before returning home to their families. The acts tonight include guitarist Sven Smith , 27, dog trainer Lucy Heath and her canine troupe The Trickstars, dancer Trey Braine , the Sslaubi Performance Troupe , cruise ship singer Taryn Charles , librarian turned rapper Bikoon , Ukrainian roller skaters Stardust , and opera singer Innocent Massuku .",

The Britain's Got Talent show host made a jokey reference to his newborn son while kicking off the semi-finals tonight. 2 Ant McPartlin is appearing on BGT tonight for the first time since his son was born Credit: ITV 2 He showed Wilder Patrick Mcpartlin off to the world earlier this week Credit: antanddec/Instagram He is heading up the live show alongside friend and co-host Declan Donnelly. Eight acts are set to perform tonight, with each of them hoping they have a chance to make it through to the last round of the competition. Two acts from each semi-final this week will make it through to Sunday's grand final – with one decided from a public vote and the second decided by the judges. Ant's wife Anne-Marie Corbett gave birth to their son Wilder Patrick last Tuesday, and the showbiz legend made an allusion to his first child on stage tonight. Dec started reading off a checklist of items supposedly needed for BGT, which included nappies and other baby essentials, before Ant cut in laughing: \"No that's my list!\" He also shared a bit of banter with the panel of judges after Simon paid tribute to the new dad, saying: \"Can i just say congratulations to you Ant, I really am happy for you.\" The TV presenter replied: \"Thank you. thank you very much. Thank you for your lovely gift. Judges - still waiting on yours!\" Dec is said to have been coaching his co-host and best friend through being a dad for the first time.

        "content": "( KTLA ) – Mike Tyson suffered a medical emergency on a flight headed to Los Angeles from Miami on Sunday night. “Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great,” Tyson’s representatives said. “He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare-up 30 minutes before landing. He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.” Reports that the flight was delayed due to the emergency are inaccurate, Tyson’s reps said. The flight took off two hours later than scheduled. “It’s false reporting that his medical attention caused the flight delay,” his team stated. “This two-hour delay was due to an air conditioning issue on the aircraft.” According to In Touch Weekly , the flight was also delayed 25 minutes once it landed at LAX as paramedics boarded the aircraft to tend to Tyson. This comes a little under two months before Tyson, 57, is set to return to the ring after almost 20 years. On July 20, about a month after his 58th birthday, he’ll take on 27-year-old Jake Paul in a boxing match at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The fight will be streamed live on Netflix.",

        "content": "By Curtis Williams HOUSTON (Reuters) - Trinidad and Tobago received six bids from BP (LON: BP ), Shell (LON: RDSa ) and US shale producer EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG ) on four blocks to explore for oil and gas as its 2023 shallow water auction closed on Monday. Trinidad plans to announce the winners in four months, Energy Minister Stuart Young said at the closing of the auction. All three companies bid for the Modified UC block, which is close to the Teak, Sammaan, Poui producing fields. The auction had no other bidders. Trinidad is Latin America's largest producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), with installed capacity of 15 million metric tons per year of the super-cooled gas. It also is one of the world's biggest exporters of methanol and ammonia, but its plants have been operating below full capacity in recent years due to a lack of gas. In October 2023 the Trinidad government put out 13 blocks for bids. Monday's results mean that nine of the 13 blocks did not receive any interest and all the bids were from companies already operating on the Caribbean island. EOG Resources bid on three blocks, the Modified UC; the Lower Reverse L, which is west of Shell's Manatee discovery and on the border with neighboring Venezuela; and NCMA 4, in an area operated by Shell. Shell had one bid on Modified UC while BP, which bid on Modified UC also placed a bid for NCMA 2 which is north of Trinidad and not in the Columbus basin where the company has operated since the 1970s. Trinidad made several changes to the fiscal terms to attract more bids after the failure of its 2019 bid round, including reducing the tax liability for shallow-water producers, raising cost recovery to 60% from 50%, cutting the windfall tax to 50% from 70%, increasing the exploration period to eight years from six years and lowering the bid fee to $30,000 from $40,000.",

        "content": "Smartphone ban for kids 'worth considering' - MPs 3 days ago Nathan Standley , Vanessa Clarke Share BBC / Ann Gannon Schoolboy Jasper says having social media is important for 'finding people you can connect with' The next government should consider proposals to ban smartphones for under-16s within its first year, a committee of MPs has said. The Education Select Committee report outlined some of the \"serious dangers\" posed to children online. Government guidance to bar phone use in schools in England earlier this year prompted a debate on how much screen time children should be having. But children's charity the NSPCC said that so far, the voices of the young people themselves had been \"glaringly absent\" from it. The report, published on Saturday, said the risks of increased screen time for children and young people significantly outweighed its benefits. Committee chairman Robin Walker said its inquiry had heard \"shocking statistics on the extent of the damage being done to under-18s\". The report found there had been a significant rise in screen time in recent years, with one in four children now using their phone in a manner resembling behavioural addiction. The report said almost all children own a phone by the age of 12, and that 79% had encountered violent pornography before the age of 18. It said the Online Safety Act, which puts responsibility on social media firms to protect children from some legal - but harmful - material, would provide some protection, but not until the law was fully implemented in 2026. The committee says that without urgent action, more children could be put in harm's way. It recommended the next government should work with the regulator, Ofcom, to... Nathan Standley",

Scottish leader, Alex Cole-Hamilton, accused the SNP and Conservative governments either side of the border of \"neglecting\" services and turning parts of the UK into \"dental deserts\". UK leader Sir Ed Davey joined him at a campaign event in North Queensferry, and predicted the Lib Dems would make gains in Scotland and become the UK's third largest party. He said his party would not form a coalition with the Conservatives, but did not rule out an agreement with Labour. \"There are lots of hypotheticals but I'm going to focus on the campaign,\" Sir Ed told BBC Scotland News. Sir Ed said electing Lib Dem MPs would help to \"send a message\" to the SNP government, who he accused of \"failing\" on NHS dentistry. Although he acknowledged dentistry was a devolved issue, the party leader said UK-wide measures, such as cutting VAT on children's toothbrushes and toothpaste, would have an impact in Scotland. He told BBC Scotland News the NHS was the biggest issue for voters north of the border. \"It is things like GPs and dentists and hospital times and cancer waiting times,\" Sir Ed said. \"And then issues like sewage and the state of the economy. \"This is an election...

        "content": "What is the Tory national service plan and how might it work? 13 hours ago Sean Seddon , BBC News Share Reuters The Conservatives have set out a plan to require 18-year-olds take part in a form of national service if the party wins the general election on 4 July. Rishi Sunak said the scheme would promote a \"shared sense of purpose among our young people and a renewed sense of pride in our country\". Labour has labelled the plan a \"gimmick\" and other parties have criticised the government for its record on cutting troop numbers. However, there is still much we do not know about how it would work. Here is the detail we have so far. What is the national service scheme? The proposed new scheme would not be conscription, where people are legally required to join the armed forces for a period. But it would compel people by law to complete a community programme over a 12-month period, or enrol in a year-long military training scheme, when they turn 18. The name is taken from the mandatory military training British men aged 17-21 had to undertake between 1949 and 1960. Then, national service meant 18 months of military training and spending four years on a reserve list, meaning they could be called up to fight at short notice. The scheme being proposed now would not force anyone to do military training, Home Secretary James Cleverly told the BBC. It would be made up of two broad streams for 18-year-olds to choose from: Community volunteering: Spending one weekend every month - which equates to 25 days over a 12-month period - volunteering with organisations such as the NHS, fire service, ambulance, search and rescue, and critical local infrastructure Spending one weekend every month - which equates to 25 days over a 12-month period - volunteering with organisations such as the NHS, fire service, ambulance, search and rescue, and critical local infrastructure...

The Conservatives have pledged that, if they win the general election, 18-year-olds will have to take part in a scheme involving military or non-military service. Mr Cleverly said it would \"address the fragmentation in society\" - but added that sending people to jail for not taking part was not being proposed. Labour said the plan was \"a desperate gimmick\" with no viable funding. Mr Cleverly told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme the move was about \"coming together\". \"Too many young people are living in their own bubble, whether that's a digital bubble or a social bubble. \"We want to get back to a situation where young people are mixing with people - in different areas, different economic groups, different religions - to try and find a way of addressing the kind of fragmentation that we see too much of,\" he said. The Conservatives say the scheme would involve 30,000 selective military placements where \"the brightest and best\" volunteers would get involved in cyber security, logistics, or civil response operations full-time for a year.

        "content": "Leaders pitch for votes on first campaign weekend 2 days ago Share John Swinney was among Scottish party leaders out on the campaign trail The leaders of Scotland's major parties have hit the campaign trail on the first weekend of the general election race. The SNP, Scottish Labour, the Scottish Conservatives and the Scottish Liberal Democrats held events across the country in the early stages of the campaign. John Swinney, Anas Sarwar, Douglas and Alex Cole-Hamilton have 41 days to make their case to voters before they head to the polls. The vote will take place on 4 July after prime minister Rishi Sunak's surprise announcement earlier this week. The first minister used his event in Glenrothes, Fife, to hone in on the SNP's anti-austerity message. He accused the Conservatives of presiding over a \"punishing and damaging process\" of reduced public spending, adding only his party could exert enough influence at Westminster to ensure the policy is reversed. However, Mr Swinney denied his handling of the Michael Matheson expenses scandal threatened to overshadow his campaign. The first minister took aim at the makeup disciplinary panel that recommended a 27-day suspension after the former health secretary racked up an £11,000 charge on a parliamentary iPad during a family holiday. He said: \"We're fighting hard to win. We know we've got a challenge on our hands, it has been a tough time for the SNP but there's fresh... BBC News",

Mr Gove, first elected MP for Surrey Heath in 2005, is understood to have made the decision in the last couple of days. He is the most high-profile of the nearly 80 Conservative MPs who have stepped down ahead of the 4 July vote - alongside public health minister Dame Andrea Leadsom.

        "content": "IRELAND AM star Alan Hughes has admitted he is \"terrified of dying\" after experiencing multiple tragic family deaths. The Virgin Media star first experienced grief at just 10 years old after his parents died within six months of each other. Alan has now opened up about his grief and how the passing of his loved ones has made him \"more determined\". Speaking to the RTE Guide , the 60-year-old discussed how he was orphaned at a young age after his mum and dad both passed away. Describing the tough time, he said: \"It was a shock for all the family. She [his mother] had been unwell, so I was in her room, just lying with her and she passed.\" The popular presenter also went through a hard period when his sister Doreen passed away, just a year after he got married to his husband Karl Broderick. The Irish star recalled the first time his sister met his partner and laughed: \"When Doreen first met Karl, she said 'I really like you but if you do anything on him, I'll come and haunt you!' \"Now, when something good happens for myself and Karl I say, 'Ah they are all looking down on us.\" And Alan's brother David sadly died back in 2017 after a short battle with lung cancer. The TV host has highlighted how his siblings passing has made him \"very determined\". He said: \"When you see your sister and your brother die at a youngish age, you just want to grasp life and live it. And I've always been a glass-half-full person.\" Alan told how he \"believes there is a God\" and \"hopes there is a life after this one\". He continued: \"I hope it's where I'll meet all those family and friends I've loved, but maybe I have that hope because I'm terrified of dying.\" Separately, Alan recently enjoyed a \"fun night\" with his husband and his fans have all said they looked \"very handsome\". The popular presenter and his long-term partner Karl Broderick got married in October 2011, however they have been together for over 30 years . Alan and Karl recently attended the fashion event of the year at the Platinum VIP Style awards. The happy couple documented themselves getting ready for the event.

Thanks @luykxbianca @taradolloconnor for the invite and to @intercondublin and @nickylogue1 for the lovely stay. \"So be honest who wore it better me or Karl.\" In the video, Alan and Karl could be seen standing in white robes as they held up suit bags with their outfits in them. The famous pair then walked towards the camera with big smiles and covered it up. In the next clip, the love birds both posed in smart suits while holding up two glasses of champagne. Alan stunned in a beautiful green blazer with a black satin trim. The 60-year-old finished off the look with a clean white shirt a black dickey bow and some black tailored trousers.

What's more, the award-winning singer's life wasn't always this way, and her personality has changed a lot since her early years too. During a rare interview, her mom, Tina Knowles, gave an insight into what Beyoncé was like as a child, making the heartbreaking revelation that she was bullied for a while. Tina also disclosed that the Texas Hold 'Em hitmaker was incredibly shy as a child. The 70-year-old told Vogue: \"Beyoncé, she was very shy and she got bullied a bit, but the day that she stood up for someone—she didn't stand up for herself she stood up for them. I'm getting emotional talking about it. I was just, I couldn't have been more proud of her.\" Tina also spoke about her other \"girls\", daughter Solange and Kelly Rowland, who she often refers to as her third daughter. She said: \"Solange, was her signing a petition in school, she was only in, like, fifth grade and she was out getting petitions signed. So she's always been an activist. \"And Kelly was always this kid that just tried to protect everybody. I have a memory of her with her best friend Barbara and her being a mediator and just being this little peacemaker.\" Tina adores her family and recently gave an insight into her grandchildren's personalities too. During a chat with E! News, she gave a rare insight into the lives of Beyoncé's twins Rumi and Sir, six, who unlike their sister Blue Ivy, 12, have kept a lower profile in their young lives so far. She said: \"Rumi is amazing—an amazing artist, painter, and creator.\" Reflecting on the twins' flourishing creativity, Tina mused, \"How could they be anything else growing up in that environment?\" She emphasized that their family life is steeped in discussions about creativity and fashion, nurturing their innate talents from a very young age. Sir, on the other hand, shares more similarities with his father, Jay-Z. \"Sir is very quiet,\" Tina noted, revealing that he gravitates more towards numbers than fashion. \"He does all of the numbers stuff, so he's not into fashion as much,\" she explained, but quickly added that Sir is \"very, very smart,\" hinting at the diverse talents the twins possess. Beyoncé shares her three children with husband Jay-Z. Despite being one of the most famous couples, they are notoriously private when it comes to their personal lives. However, in the last year, the family have been in the news more and more thanks to Beyoncé's numerous projects, from her Renaissance World Tour - which saw daughter Blue step into the spotlight and join her mom on stage - to the release of her new country music album, Cowboy Carter. During the same interview, Tina spoke of her pride for Beyoncé stepping into the country music scene, which saw her recently make history as the first Black woman to top the country charts. \"We're from Texas,\" Tina explained. \"We’ve been part of that culture for a long time, and I was very excited about it.\" She described Cowboy Carter as a \"nice history lesson\" for fans, applauding Beyoncé’s ability to educate subtly through her music. \"She has this way of doing things subtly but educating, and so I’m really proud of that,\" Tina shared.

        "description": "Indigenous leaders were in Ottawa on Monday, calling on the federal government to follow-through on a commitment to fund a new hospital in Moosonee, along Ontario’s James Bay coast.",
        "content": "Indigenous leaders were in Ottawa on Monday to call on the federal government to follow through on a commitment to fund a new hospital in Moosonee, along Ontario's James Bay coast. They say the federal government promised to set aside $1.3 billion to help build the hospital, but that money wasn't included in the last federal budget. The hospital would replace a 74-year-old facility in neighbouring Moose Factory, which is Canada's oldest, non-renovated hospital. \"It's not just a building, it is a symbol of the enduring colonial legacy our people are forced to confront daily,\" said Lynne Innes, CEO of the Weeneebayko Area Health Authority, which runs health-care services in the region. The Moose Factory hospital was built in 1950 as a tuberculosis sanitorium, where children who were taken from their home communities were isolated from their families and culture. Built in 1950, the Weeneebayko hospital in Moose Factory is set to be replaced by a new regional James Bay hospital currently under construction in Moosonee. (Erik White/CBC) Because Moose Factory is on an island, patients have to be transported by helicopter to receive care. Dr. Elaine Innes, the Weeneebayko Area Health Authority's chief of staff, said patients from James Bay communities often have to travel south to Kingston, Ont., for care. \"We struggle with providing specialty services,\" she said. \"We can no longer provide obstetrical care because we no longer have the health human resources.\" James Bay health authority says 'huge surprise' in federal budget could halt hospital construction New Moosonee hospital to replace 74 year old facility in Moose Factory Moose Cree First Nation Chief Peter Wesley extended an invitation for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to visit Moose Factory and see the state of the hospital. \"There's no other hospital where you walk down the hallway and the roof is caving in,\" Wesley said. \"This would not be tolerated in any other urban community. This would not be tolerated in Ottawa. This would not be tolerated in Toronto, or Sudbury. Why do we have to tolerate it as First Nations people?\" National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak says that in 2007, the federal government committed to help fund a new hospital in Moosonee. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press) Assembly of First Nations National Chief Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak thanked the provincial government for its support on the Moosonee hospital project, but said the federal government has fallen short. \"Now we need the feds to come back to the table,\" she said. Woodhouse Nepinak and others noted that the federal government agreed to support the new hospital in 2007, when plans were first unveiled. 'I'm not walking away from that commitment' Indigenous Services Minister Patty Hajdu previously said in the House of Commons that she remains committed to the project. \"I'm not walking away from that commitment and we will get that hospital built,\" Hajdu said. In an email to CBC News, Indigenous Services Canada spokesperson Ryan Tyndall said the federal government's 2018 budget included $158.4 million for the construction of the hospital. But Tyndall added that health care is a provincial responsibility. He said the federal government has \"significantly increased\" health transfers to the provinces to support them in delivering health care. In Ontario, those transfers went from $13.1 billion in 2015 to $20.3 billion in 2024.",

        "content": "Former Love Island stars Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury have headed off on a romantic UK break as they put on a united front following rumours that they had split Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury had shut down rumours of a split as they continue celebrating her 25th birthday. Fans had been left concerned over the pair's relationship in recent weeks, after they both jetted off away without one another. However, the pair have since put on a united front, with both Molly-Mae and Tommy sharing photos of her 25th birthday. Molly even shared a clip of Tommy surprising her with a delicious-looking birthday cake at home. And keeping the celebrations going, the former Love Island runner-ups have now headed on a romantic UK-based getaway as they and their one-year-old daughter Bambi enjoy a stay at Oxfordshire's Estelle Manor. Both Molly-Mae and Tommy have been sharing snaps and videos of their family getaway, with Tommy sharing a sweet one of Molly kissing their daughter. Sharing a photo of the lavish location, Molly-Mae quipped that she was in her \" Saltburn element \" while staying at the country estate turned hotel. Molly-Mae sweetly shared that Tommy had \"spoilt\" her with the luxury birthday getaway. After sharing a number of pics, Molly-Mae revealed that she was staying in the lavish Estelle Manor - adding that she's wanted to visit the hotel \"for so long.\" Molly and Tommy continued to share snaps of their romantic getaway, just weeks after they each jetted off abroad - with Molly heading to her sister's hen do in Ibiza , while Tommy flew to Dubai to support his brother, Tyson Fury, in a boxing match. The couple's separate holidays raised a few eyebrows, and some eagle-eyed fans quickly pointed out that they had also not been interacting with one another on social media - with Molly-Mae even failing to publicly wish her fiance a happy birthday. After arriving back in the UK the couple shut down rumours of a split when Molly shared a photo of Tommy confirming he was back at their Cheshire home . And they have since been sharing photos of Molly's birthday celebrations in which they appear as loved-up as ever. Molly and Tommy have only continued to show that they remain solidly loved-up as they make the most of the romantic getaway. Molly-Mae shared a \"special\" photo of Tommy and Bambi going for a stroll hand-in-hand. Molly then shared a sweet photo of Tommy playing croquet with their one-year-old daughter.",

        "description": "Rafael Nadal was beaten by Alexander Zverev in the first round of the French Open on Sunday, with the 14-time champion giving an emotional speech to the crowd after the match",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal has addressed his future after a surprising first-round defeat to Alexander Zverev at the French Open. Despite avoiding direct comments about retirement, the 14-time champion in Paris hinted that this might have been his last appearance at Roland Garros. Despite a 6-3 7-6(5) 6-3 loss, Nadal believes he \"was not that far off\" and \"had his chances\" against the world No. 4, who had recently clinched the Italian Open. \"I played I think at a good level in all ways, compared to the way that I was playing the weeks before. So, happy for that. Of course disappointed for losing, but in terms of body feelings, happy that I finish healthy, you know, and I had a tough battle out there. And I was ready for a little bit more,\" he said, before making a significant remark about his future in Paris. \"So that's it. Accept the moment. If it's the last time that I played here, I am in peace with myself,\" he said with a smile, suggesting that he may have already bid his farewell to the French Open. \"I tried everything to be ready for this tournament for almost 20 years. And today and the last two years I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here, no? At least I did. I mean, I lost, but that's part of the business.\" Andy Murray's French Open journey ends in defeat to Stan Wawrinka as retirement looms World No. 1 Novak Djokovic candid about his struggles and modest hopes for French Open Despite the uncertain future for Nadal, one thing remains evident - the Spanish tennis ace is determined to participate in the upcoming Olympic Games, slated for Paris' iconic Stade Roland Garros. The 22-time Grand Slam champion revealed: \"I need to finish all this process. My mindset was ready 'til Olympics, you know, and then I need to check how I feel in different ways, I mean, in terms of personal motivation, body feelings, and then in terms of the level of tennis it makes sense to keep playing.\" Beginning to rediscover his form, the soon-to-be 38-year-old explained: \"For me the feeling of coming back home with the personal satisfaction to do all what's in my hands to make the things work well, give myself everything, that's the only way that I understand my life, you know.\" He further clarified. \"That's why I am not saying I am retiring today. You know, at the end, it's about not having the feeling in one year or one year and a half that, you know, I didn't give myself a chance, a real chance, you know, because immediately that I started to become a little bit healthier, I stop.\" Nadal, who is still relishing his time on the tour, expressed his desire to continue playing \"for a while\". He said: \"So in terms of what's driving me, what's the force behind driving me, I mean, as I said, I'm a simple guy. I enjoy what I do. You know, I am passionate about sport, I am passionate about competition. I like to practice, I like to play tennis. I'm in a different moment of my personal life too, traveling with my son, wife, you know. I am enjoying these moments that will not come back. \"So if I keep enjoying doing what I am doing and I feel myself competitive and healthy enough to enjoy, I want to keep going for a while. I don't know for how long, but I want to keep going for a while, because they are having fun, I am having fun, and I need to see, I need to give myself a little bit longer chances to see if my level is growing and my body is holding, and then let's make a decision.\" While he hinted at the future of his career, Nadal refrained from making any official statements. \"But give me two months till Olympics, and then let's see if I am able to keep going or I say, okay, guys, it's more than enough. Let's see. I mean, today is not a moment to analyze all these kinds of things. It's a moment just to keep going, accept the moment, and let's see what's going on,\" he concluded.",

        "content": "PLYMOUTH — The Chilmark man prosecutors said stabbed two workers at a local McDonald’s, then injured himself when he crashed his car during a State Police pursuit in Sandwich Saturday night, was held without bail Monday after he was released from the hospital, according to the Plymouth District Attorney’s office. Jared Ravizza, 26, is due to be arraigned Tuesday in Plymouth District Court on charges including assault with intent to murder, and two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon in connection with the stabbings, prosecutors have said. Officials Monday released few new details about the investigation into the attacks, which State Police and Braintree police have said may be connected to the stabbing of four girls at the AMC Braintree 10 theater at about 6 p.m. Saturday, about an hour before the McDonald’s attack. Advertisement The attacks occurred at the McDonald’s location at the Route 3 service plaza around 7 p.m. Saturday. Prosecutors said surveillance video appears to show Ravizza grab a 28-year-old man working at the drive through window, and stab him with a large knife. Ravizza then parked his car, entered the restaurant, and stabbed a 21-year-old woman who also worked there, prosecutors said. After the attacks, Ravizza got back into his black 2018 Porsche Macan and fled the scene. A witness reported the car’s plates to State Police and troopers tried to pull Ravizza over, but he wouldn’t stop, authorities said. Ravizza crashed his vehicle in Sandwich, and he was arrested by troopers and local police around 7:15 p.m., officials said. He was taken to South Shore Hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries, and had remained in the hospital Sunday. The district attorney’s spokesperson did not have information about Ravizza’s attorney Monday, and no court files were available online. Ravizza is referred to using male pronouns on a professional website and in court papers. Ravizza uses “she” on Instagram. Advertisement At the McDonald’s location in Plymouth Monday, the restaurant was operating normally, with little sign of the chaos that unfolded less than two days earlier. Two managers on duty at the restaurant, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak about the event, both said that the stabbing was a “very scary” situation. They said the two employees who were injured in the stabbing had been discharged from a hospital and were in stable condition, and declined to provide any further details. In an emailed statement Monday, Mark McBee, a McDonald’s Franchisee who owns and operates several McDonald’s restaurants in the region, said he was grateful to law enforcement for their quick response to the stabbing incident at the restaurant. “We are shocked and devastated by this senseless act of violence,” McBee said. “The safety of our crew and customers is always our top priority.” McDonald’s did not provide further details about the health condition of the workers. On Sunday, Lisa Dembowski — the mother of three of the girls injured in the theater attack — said the girls were fine physically, but remained terrified following their ordeal. Dembowski’s twin 9-year-olds were injured, along with her 17-year-old and their friend. Dembowski criticized AMC staff for failing to immediately respond to the stabbings, and said employees initially didn’t believe the girls were stabbed. Her oldest daughter was the one who called police for help, she said. Advertisement “I give her an enormous amount of credit, because in my mind ... her and her friend kept the two little ones completely calm,” Dembowski said. AMC Theatres, in a statement sent Monday, said the company was saddened by Saturday’s “senseless act of violence,” and are reaching out to the girls’ families privately. The company said it has started a review of the incident. “Based on theatre associate accounts and video footage, the theatre team jumped into action immediately, calling emergency services and administering aid to the victims,” the statement said. “A visible security presence will be in place at this location for the immediate future.” Saturday’s stabbings came about six weeks after Ravizza attacked his father in their West Tisbury home, according to court filings. Ravizza was charged with assault and battery on a family or household member, and the case was directed to pretrial diversion. His father said Ravissa had suffered a “mental break” and attacked him, according to a police report on file at Edgartown District Court. West Tisbury police took Ravizza to Martha’s Vineyard Hospital for a mental health evaluation, but Ravizza “did not meet their standards to be held,′′ the police report said. The hospital is part of the Mass General Brigham system, and a spokesperson declined to answer questions Monday about Ravizza’s evaluation due to patient privacy laws. Along with the stabbings, Ravizza was sought by law enforcement for “other incidents,” according to the Plymouth district attorney’s office, which did not provide additional details. Advertisement Connecticut State Police said a suspect sought in connection with a fatal stabbing in the town of Deep River had been arrested by Massachusetts authorities Saturday. The agency on Monday declined to provide further details or say on Sunday whether there was a connection between Ravizza and the Connecticut death.

        "content": "The Esan South East Local Government Council of Edo State, led by Hon. Louis Imhandegbelo has been given kudos for being the first local government council in the state to pay the new minimum wage of N70,000 to workers. The council’s implimentation of the new minimum wage has drawn widespread jubilations across the length and breadth of the local government area. The council workers were seen singing and dancing on Monday at Ubiaja, the council headquarters, praising governor Godwin Obaseki soon after receiving the month of May salaries. Some of them were said to have been dumbfounded on receiving the unexpected bank alerts reflecting the newly established N70,000 minimum wage in Edo State from their various banks. Governor Godwin Obaseki in his speech on May 1st, 2024, to mark this year’s workers day announced N70,000 new minimum wage for Edo State workers which was paid this month by the state government. The development has garnered accolades both within and beyond the borders of Nigeria. The chairman of Esan South East Local Government Council, Louis Imhandegbelo while expressing his gratitude to Governor Godwin Obaseki said, “today, May 27, 2024, my council has paid the new minimum wage to workers and praises should go to God and the governor who believed that the workers were no longer getting things easy since the removal of fuel subsidy by the Federal government”. “As you can see, upon receiving their May salaries, which reflected the new wage structure, the workers are very happy and are jubilating, I asked them to continue to pray for the governor to end his tenure successfully”. Hon. Imhandegbelo however affirmed his commitment to fostering policies that enhance workers satisfaction, promote community development, and bring joy to the people of Esan South East.",

        "content": "The Moroccan Ambassador to Ghana, Her, Excellency Ambassador Imane Ouaadil on 25th May 2024 led the African Group of Ambassadors in Ghana to celebrate this year’s African Union Day. The event also brought together dignitaries and prominent personalities in the country to witness the display and exhibition of the various African tradition, culture, and dishes. Addressing dignitaries and guests at the event, Ambassador Imane Ouaadil said “This year’s celebration acquires particular historical significance –the 61stAnniversary Celebration of the Founding of our continental organization under the theme Educate an African fit for the 21st Century: Building resilient education systems for increased access to inclusive, lifelong, quality, and relevant learning in Africa.” According her Commitment to education has marked the continent’s progress since the 1960s era of independence. “Now more than ever, this resolve must transform Africa into the world’s powerhouse for the 21st century. The AU Year of Education is a unique opportunity to recommit member states to achieving the Continental Strategy for Education in Africa, Agenda 2030 and SDG 4, as well as Agenda 2063. Ambassador Imane Ouaadil emphasized that “If knowledge is power, then education is the key to unlocking that power. Education is now front and center of the development debate – and with good reason. Today, 40% of all Africans are under 15. Another 100 million children will be born here by 2050. Yet, of the 1 million Africans entering the labour market every month, fewer than 25% find a job in the formal economy. This demographic dividend should offer a tremendous opportunity for Africa to build a valuable base of human capital that will serve as the engine for the economic transformation of our continent.” She noted that “The time has never been more auspicious to focus on education, particularly in science, technology and mathematics. The burgeoning youth population of Africa will drive the growth and prosperity of the continent into the next generation, but only if we equip them to do so.” “Allow me use this opportunity to express our profound gratitude and appreciation to the Government of Ghana for celebrating this unique day with us. As the Principal Representatives of our respective countries, it is part of our cardinal responsibilities to promote political, economic, and socio-cultural partnerships that will lead to the realisation of mutual benefits.” She added .",

(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) By KRISTIE RIEKEN (AP Sports Writer) HOUSTON (AP) — When Jose Trevino took a teen leadership class taught by Sherri Davis in high school the New York Yankees catcher couldn’t have imagined the long-lasting impact it would have. “It changed my life,” Trevino told The Associated Press. “She taught me a ton of lessons in high school, life lessons that help to this day.” So, when Davis retired after a 47-year teaching career and started a nonprofit in his hometown of Corpus Christi, Texas, called “ Special Hearts in the Arts ” in 2016 to provide arts education to those with special needs, Trevino quickly became one of the organization’s most important benefactors. This week he’ll give the beloved group another gift to continue its work. Trevino has been selected as the first Most Valuable Philanthropist of the year by the MLBPA Players Trust and is receiving a $5,000 grant for Special Hearts. Trevino was selected for the award over more than a dozen other applicants by a panel of four former players. Amy Hever, the director of the Players Trust, said its focus is to help players create more impact for causes in their communities. “So, this is a way to not only recognize them, but it also raises tremendous awareness for these causes, especially these hyper-local causes and organizations that some would argue are doing the greatest work in their local communities,” Hever said. Davis raved about Trevino’s generosity and the special bond he’s built with the group. Trevino often visits Special Hearts in the offseason and the students rave about meeting him and covet the pictures he’s taken with them. “You’ll never have anyone say anything bad about Jose,” Davis said. “I think he just makes people feel worthy of whatever they do. That’s a Jose thing that he does.” At Special Hearts , students, who range in age from 12-80, take classes in a variety of the arts including dance, theater, music and art. The group performs around the city and has become a favorite of Corpus Christi mayor Paulette M. Guajardo, who invites them to participate in the Fourth of July celebration each year. On Saturday morning, about three dozen Special Hearts performed a sign language version of the song “Love Can Build A Bridge.” Students beamed as they did the number, which they’ve adopted as their theme song. Arts are the focus of the center, but perhaps more important is the confidence participation builds and the community that is forged through the classes. “We don’t say special needs in here,” Davis said. “We say Special Hearts. We never say disabilities. We always say special abilities.” Before each of their performances Davis leads the group in a back-and-forth affirmation. “I always ask them: ‘Who are you?’ And they say: ‘Special Hearts.’ And I say: ‘What do you have? Special abilities?’” Victoria Hinojosa has been a Special Heart for about three years and is the center of the group’s ballet folklorico performances, plays the guitar and takes art classes. When she first joined the group, she told Davis she couldn’t dance because she’s in a wheelchair. “I said: ‘don’t say, I can’t do, say do what you can, how you can,’” Davis said. “And boy, can she swing that skirt.” Hinojosa, who recently began volunteering to help others at the center, can’t overstate the importance of Special Hearts in her life. “I don’t know where I would have been if it wasn’t for Special Hearts,” she said. “It has really made me feel confident in what I do and how I look at things and I love the way I draw now, and it inspires me to do more.” Though he’s often almost 2,000 miles away in New York City, Trevino’s presence is a huge part of Special Hearts. A big photo of him hangs in Davis’ office and posters featuring pictures of him and the students adorn the center. Davis sends him videos of their performances and she recently sent a picture of the group holding a Yankees banner they made with his name on it. “It’s amazing what he’s doing for Special Hearts,” Hinojosa said. “He has really made us all happy, made us really look at ourselves and think we can do whatever we want. We can go out there and perform... and show people what we can do.” Though Davis and the students credit Trevino for his support, he’s quick to point out that the most special heart in the organization is the one belonging to his former teacher. “That’s what it is, it’s her heart,” Trevino said. “Her heart — it’s ginormous. She has a big heart and she’s always looking out for other people.” Idali Duarte Montes, another former student of Davis who now works with her at Special Hearts, agreed. “Without Sherri, of course, this wouldn’t even be here,” she said. “It came completely from her 100%. And all her hard work was what started it. And then everybody, all the love that she exudes and gets from others that want to support and help has brought all that to Special Hearts in the Arts.” Wiliam Rucizka, is another student who is known around Corpus Christi as “Will The Thrill” for his ability to hype up the crowds before performances. Constantly smiling and upbeat, Rucizka enjoys a variety of activities at the center . “We do art, music, theater, dance and ... we do ‘Love Can Build a Bridge’ every day,” he said. “We do celebrating every day.” And because of Trevino’s recent gift, Special Hearts will add a new program. Called “The Remarkables,” the group will dress as superheroes, each with their own special power, and perform at children’s hospitals and nursing homes. Though he’s been out of high school for more than a decade, Trevino still leans on things Davis taught him. An important one is a breathing technique that the Gold and Platinum Glove winner uses to slow things down and “really be in the moment” before games. “It’s really cool what Ms. Davis is doing, and I have a lot of respect for her, and I appreciate everything she’s doing,” Trevino said. “I think anybody who’s around Ms. Davis is lucky because she’s just a great person.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

        "content": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan strongly condemned the Israeli bombardment and targeting of a United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) refugee camp in Rafah in Gaza Strip that resulted in multiple casualties. In a press statement, the foreign office said that targeting individuals who are displaced earlier because of Israeli bombardment and were sheltered in a refugee camp, is yet another breach of international humanitarian law by the Israeli occupation forces. “The attack is also a blatant defiance of the additional provisional measures of 24 May 2024 by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordering Israel to immediately halt its military offensive in Rafah in conformity with its obligations under the Genocide Convention and the worsening humanitarian conditions faced by civilians,” the statement read. It added that with its latest actions, Israeli occupation forces have once again demonstrated their contempt for international law and the basic tenets of decency and acceptable international behaviour. “Pakistan reiterates its demand for immediate and unconditional implementation of the orders of the ICJ of 24 May 2024. Measures must be taken to fully protect civilians in Gaza and the Israeli occupation forces must be held accountable for the Gaza genocide. We call on the UN Security Council to play its role in preventing Israel from any further attacks against the civilians in Rafah and taking effective measures to protect the people of Gaza”, the statement concluded.",

On Monday (May 27), the RM shared the Pennacky-directed clip for “Groin,” which finds the singer and rapper decked out in a dark Adidas track jacket while dancing and rapping in the streets. The three-minute video arrives on the heels of RM’s second solo album, Right Place, Wrong Person , which was released on Friday (May 24), and topped Billboard ‘s latest weekly new music poll featuring artists in various genres of music. Right Place, Wrong Person brings with it 11 new tracks for fans to enjoy amid BTS’ military obligations. Led by the dream single “Come Back to Me,” the album also features the alternative-based songs “Nuts,” “Heaven,” “LOST!” and more. Overall, the project reflects a “raw and honest presentation of RM’s distinctive sensibility, aesthetics, and beliefs,” per a BigHit news release, and follows the South Korean artist’s 2022 debut album, Indigo , which reached No. 3 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. Right Place, Wrong Person includes collaborations with British rapper-singer Little Simz (“Domodachi”) and singer-guitarist Moses Sumney (“Around the World in a Day”). “Come Back to Me” features lyrics by RM, with guest musicians OHHYUK from South Korean band HYUKOH, and guitar and bass from Kuo of Taiwanese band Sunset Rollercoaster, as well as contributions by singer-songwriter JNKYRD and San yawn of Balming Tiger. RM and his BTS bandmates Jin, SUGA, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jung Kook are currently serving in the South Korean military, which mandates an 18-month military enlistment for all able-bodied men by the time they turn 28. A few of the members have pursued various solo projects amid their service, and the full group is planning to reconvene for band activities in 2025. Watch RM’s “Groin” video below.",

        "description": "Larson was trying to run both the Indy 500 and the Coca-Cola 600, but rain delayed the start at Indy and ended the Cup Series races before he could get in the car.",
        "content": "Kyle Larson waves to fans as he leaves the track after the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday. Larson was trying to make it to to the NASCAR Cup Series race in Concord, North Carolina in time to race, but rain prevented that from happening. Darron Cummings/Associated Press CONCORD, N.C. — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only a single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s quest was to complete – if not win – the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday, joining Tony Stewart as the only drivers to do all 1,100 laps in a single day. But then rain intervened not once but twice, and a rookie mistake at the Indy 500 cost him a chance to contend in the one race he ran. “What I thought could be one of the best days of my life quickly turned into one of the most disappointing ones I’ve ever experienced,” Larson said on social media Monday, roughly 12 hours after storms in Charlotte prevented him from climbing into his No. 5 car to finish the NASCAR race. When rain pushed back the start of the Indy 500 by four hours, Larson’s team made the decision to stay and run the race. He made a mistake going through gears at one point, costing him 10 spots, and his pit-road speeding penalty ended any chance of winning. He wound up finishing 18th. The 31-year-old Larson tried to make the best of a bad situation, taking two helicopters and a private jet to reach Concord with the Cup Series race just past the halfway point. The crowd cheered his arrival on pit lane, and Larson donned his race helmet and readied to get into the No. 5 Chevrolet. That’s when the race went under caution, and a steady downpour forced a red flag. Two hours later, NASCAR declared race leader Christopher Bell the winner with 151 laps remaining, saying there was no way to dry the track and resume racing until after 1 a.m. because of the humidity. Larson never took a lap at Charlotte. “So much time, money and effort went into this experience and it just kills me to have it all end the way it did,” Larson said. “I feel like I let so many people down. We knew all along weather could throw a wrench into things but seeing it come to reality is a horrible feeling.” Larson said he was disappointed for car owner Rick Hendrick, apologized to his race team in Indianapolis for his mistakes and expressed frustration for the documentary crew that had followed his eight-month journey but was robbed of a great story by storms in two different states. Larson’s focus now returns to NASCAR and attempting to win his second Cup Series championship. NASCAR rules stipulate a driver can’t participate in the postseason without running every race. That means Hendrick Motorsports will need to file a waiver on behalf of Larson, asking for special permission for the 2021 season champion to race in the playoffs. That hasn’t been done yet, but given the attention Larson brought to the sport over the last few weeks, it is almost unfathomable that the governing body would not grant one. Last year, NASCAR gave Chase Elliott the opportunity to make the playoffs after he was suspended for intentionally wrecking Denny Hamlin in the Coca-Cola 600. Despite rain that washed out much of Indy 500 practice, Larson said attempting “The Double” was one of the best experiences of his life – right up until Sunday. And afterward, Larson expressed his desire to try it again; Hendrick Motorsports and Arrow McLaren have a two-year deal to field a car. “I can’t describe how appreciative I am of everyone’s support of me to live out a dream,” Larson said. “I hope it’s not the last opportunity I have to try ‘The Double’ but if it is I guess it was memorable.” Success.

        "content": "Voting at one of the busiest voting stations in Nelson Mandela Bay proceeded at a snail's pace during the special voting sessions on Monday. At Sherwood NG Kerk, in Gqeberha, the voting station was still packed an hour after the gates closed at 17:00, with close to 200 cars still parked on and outside the premises. For a visibly upset Johan Theron, 59, the \"nightmare\" was too much. \"We spent four-and-a-half hours waiting to vote,\" he said, pointing to his watch. \"This whole process was a nightmare because the people here are pathetic. They don't have their ducks in a row and wasted precious time.\" According to Theron, some voters who arrived when the voting station opened at 09:00 only left around 17:00. He said there were several delays, one of which was a voters' roll not in alphabetical order, leading to a chaotic search for voters' names. \"They tried to search for people's names and went through 79 pages to find it, but were unsuccessful anyway. At one point, the machines were offline, and they just sat there and did nothing.\" READ | Elections 2024: Smooth start to the casting of special votes, says IEC Theron said at 16:00, an hour before the voting station was supposed to close, there were still around 200 people waiting in the queue. \"We registered for special voting, thinking it would go quicker, but not at all. If I had to describe this day in one sentence, I would say it was a waste of time.\" Valerie Theron added: \"We heard that things went better at other voting stations but, at this one, there were too many names on the list that they couldn't find. \"They had three ballot boxes, and only added two more around 14:00.\" For Sonja York, the situation was made worse as her children were waiting for her. She said she had arrived at the voting station around 16:00 and, two hours later, she had still not entered the building. \"I have no choice, but to stay in the queue until my turn because I can't come tomorrow. I'm just worried about how long it will take since my children are at home waiting for me.\" York said she looked forward to voting and having her voice heard, but when it came to \"poor planning\", it did not feel worth it. \"I was at Sunridge [voting station], and it was empty there, but I can't vote there because I live here in Sherwood.\" ROLLING COVERAGE | Elections 2024: Anticipation builds as all stations prep for voters making their mark York said she had parked her car across the road at the shopping complex, thinking she would be back soon. However, she rushed to her car as soon as it became dark otherwise the complex's gate would close, leaving her stranded. \"The long wait was irritating. I have a family and kids at home. I have responsibilities to take care of.\" No party agents were present outside the voting station. News24 was not allowed inside the venue after 17:00. The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) reported a smooth start to the casting of special votes on Monday, despite some glitches resulting in voting stations opening late in parts of the country. The first official day of voting inside the country was marred by isolated protests - in the Eastern Cape and parts of Gauteng - and there were reports of voting stations failing to open, but the IEC indicated that only 0.1% of those casting their votes experienced problems doing so. Special votes continue on Tuesday, ahead of the election day for the rest of the country on Wednesday, with polls opening at 07:00.",

        "content": "SHOPPERS have announced a new list of demands as a grocery store threatens to shut down and leave residents in a food desert. Customers are continuing to protest the closure of a Hy-Vee location in Ceder Rapids, Iowa , following the grocer's announcement that it would be coming up with alternatives to ease the transition. A dozen people were seen protesting the closure, which would leave the town in a food desert. Shoppers were holding signs that said \"You deserted us,\" and \"Boycott Hy-vee\" in front of the Oakland Road location. “By educating our entire community of Cedar Rapids we’re hoping more people will show up for those who are directly impacted by the first avenue Hy-Vee closure,” Angelina Ramirez, the vice president of Advocates for Social for Justice, told local ABC affiliate KCRG. Hyvee announced that its 1st avenue store will be one of three that will be shutting down in Iowa. The announcement has left many residents in the are nervous, as they could possibly become a food desert. This occurs when there are no nearby stores for people to get healthy, fresh food. To help shoppers in the area, Hy-Vee announced that it will be providing a shuttle service from the closed location to the nearest location three days a week until September 1 The location will also continue to offer free pharmacy deliveries and free grocery deliveries to those located within a mile radius from the store. However, protesters are still not happy with the change. They have demanded the store stay open until September, pay the local activist to canvas the surrounding area, and guarantee another grocery store will go into the Hy-vee location. As of now, the grocery store has not commented on the group's recent demands. The store will officially shut down on June 23, and the company has released a statement ahead of the closure. \"No business wants to close a location and that certainly includes Hy-Vee,\" a spokesperson for the company wrote. \"Over the past several weeks, we have listened to community leaders and residents about the impact of our store closures After a meeting with the Mayor, Hy-Vee has announced how it could help the community moving forward. \"Unfortunately, these three stores have each been losing significant amounts of money for several years, and they are simply not feasible for us to operate any longer.” Community leaders have applauded Hy-Vee for how it handled the closure. \"Our meeting with community leaders last week identified priorities to ensure residents can continue to access essential services after the store closes,\" Mayor Tiffany O’Donnell said in a statement \"We brought these concerns to our meeting with Hy-Vee, focusing on things like grocery delivery charges, no-cost pharmaceutical deliveries, and partnerships with transportation providers and local food-access services for additional assistance during the transition. \"It was a positive meeting. We will continue to support efforts to address these challenges and meet our community’s needs.” City Manager Jeff Pomeranz also praised the company for its collaborative efforts. \"They focused on supporting our community members during the transition, and the discussion led to several promising solutions,\" Pomeranz said in a statement. \"Hy-Vee also indicated they are working with the property owner to avoid vacancy after the store’s closure and they will not place any use restrictions on the location, which is a positive sign. \"We are encouraged by their cooperation and hope we can continue working with them to ensure a smooth transition for our residents.”",

        "content": "As a basketball player, he was sublime, until slowed by injuries. But he was an iconoclastic, distinct presence off the court as well, in his broadcasting and activism. The announcement Monday that Bill Walton had died at 71 after a lengthy battle with cancer evidently came as no surprise to the NBA community, but to San Diegans who were unaware of his condition, his death was shocking. The lifelong resident — born in La Mesa in 1952 — has been a part of the community’s fabric since the late 1960s, when he emerged as a basketball prodigy at Helix High School. Walton’s hoops prowess continued at UCLA, where he was an all-time college great who won two NCAA titles. As a lanky, 6-foot-11 20-year-old, he had arguably the greatest championship-winning game ever in 1973 against Memphis State — making 21 of 22 shots, scoring 44 points and posting 13 rebounds and seven blocks. When healthy, his prodigious ways continued in the NBA — with Portland and Boston, where he won one NBA title with each team and was the MVP with the Trail Blazers. In his short prime in his mid-20s, he was an absolutely dominant defensive presence with few historic peers, winning reverential praise from Bill Russell, the greatest defender in NBA history. In 1985-86, after finally mostly recovering from chronic foot injuries, he was arguably the best sixth man ever for an all-time great Celtics team. And until the recent emergence of three-time Denver MVP Nikola Jokić, Walton was considered the greatest passing center of all time. When NBA historian Bill Simmons published his sprawling, encyclopedic “The Book of Basketball” in 2009, it was beyond telling that the closing pages featured Simmons traveling to San Diego to meet with Walton and tell him he was one of a handful of superstar players who understood “the secret” of the sport: that for all the focus on individual greatness, an alchemy generated by collective unselfishness was the key to team success. But Walton was also a vivid presence off the basketball court — as an anti-Vietnam War protester while at UCLA, as a quirky but often riveting TV basketball commentator, as a huge fan of bands only starting with the Grateful Dead, and locally as an activist with strong, sometimes controversial takes on San Diego issues, especially those involving his beloved Balboa Park. Alas, Walton is already being remembered in reductive ways. This was the initial headline on The New York Times’ obituary: “ Bill Walton, one of basketball’s most eccentric characters, dies at 71.” Walton deserved far better than having “eccentric” be the sole adjective in the headline about his death in the most powerful publication in the world. Simmons ends his book on a much more appropriate note: his sadness that Walton’s “mangled feet” had so marred not just his NBA career but his post-NBA life. But he took consolation from the fact that Walton had come to peace with all the what-might-have-beens about his career and learned to live with chronic pain. So should we all. Bill Walton was wonderful, special and unique. We offer our condolences to his family and to all those who were close to him. He was — is — will always be — a San Diegan for the ages.",

        "content": "DALLAS — Nicholas Kirton scored 51 runs and Ravinderpal Singh added 41 to help Canada defeat Nepal by 63 runs in a warm-up match Monday ahead of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup. Kirton slammed four fours and two sixes in his 39-ball innings. Opener Navneet Dhaliwal contributed 32 runs. Nepal, ranked 17th among T20 teams compared to No. 23 for Canada, won the toss and elected to field at the Grande Prairie Cricket Stadium. Canada finished at 183 for seven in its 20 overs and then dismissed Nepal for 120 with three balls remaining. Dillon Heyliger led the Canadian bowling attack with four wickets while Jeremy Gordon and captain Saad Bin Zafar each took two. Nepal was at 57 for one at one point, before batsmen starting falling in quick succession. The Canadians will open play at the same Texas venue Saturday, facing the co-host U.S. in the opener of the tournament that runs through June 29 in the U.S. and West Indies. Earlier this year, Canada lost a three-match one-day international series 3-0 to Nepal before defeating Nepal A 2-1 in another three-game series. Canada is scheduled to face the 15th-ranked Netherlands in a final warm-up Thursday, also in Dallas. The Canadians have been drawn in Group A with No. 1 India, No. 7 Pakistan, No. 11 Ireland and the 19th-ranked U.S. After the Americans, Canada will meet Ireland on June 7 and Pakistan on June 11, with both games in suburban New York, before wrapping up Group A play against India on June 15 in Lauderhill, Fla. The top two teams in each group move on to the Super Eights, to be played in Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The two top teams from each pool in the Super Eight then move on to the semifinals in Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago on June 26 and 27, respectively. The final will be held June 29 at the Kensington Oval in Barbados. First-round matches in the U.S. will be split between Nassau County International Cricket Stadium (New York), Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium (Dallas) and Broward County Stadium (Lauderhill). West Indies, which hosted the event in 2010, will hold matches at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium (Antigua and Barbuda), Kensington Oval (Barbados), Guyana National Stadium (Guyana), Daren Sammy Cricket Ground (Saint Lucia), Arnos Vale (Saint Vincent and The Grenadines) and Brian Lara Cricket Academy (Trinidad and Tobago). The Canadians qualified for their first T20 World Cup in October, defeating Bermuda by 39 runs to win the four-team ICC Men's T20 World Cup Americas Region Final. Canada and Bermuda both finished with 4-1-0 records with one no-result. But Canada, which lost to Bermuda by 86 runs in its opening match, won the tournament by a superior net run rate (3.98 to 2.41). The Canadians failed to qualify for the eight previous editions of the T20 World Cup, which has expanded to 20 teams in 2024. --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024 The Canadian Press",

Kirton slammed four fours and two sixes in his 39-ball innings. Opener Navneet Dhaliwal contributed 32 runs. Nepal, ranked 17th among T20 teams compared to No. 23 for Canada, won the toss and elected to field at the Grande Prairie Cricket Stadium. Canada finished at 183 for seven in its 20 overs and then dismissed Nepal for 120 with three balls remaining. Dillon Heyliger led the Canadian bowling attack with four wickets while Jeremy Gordon and captain Saad Bin Zafar each took two. Nepal was at 57 for one at one point, before batsmen starting falling in quick succession. The Canadians will open play at the same Texas venue Saturday, facing the co-host U.S. in the opener of the tournament that runs through June 29 in the U.S. and West Indies. Earlier this year, Canada lost a three-match one-day international series 3-0 to Nepal before defeating Nepal A 2-1 in another three-game series. Canada is scheduled to face the 15th-ranked Netherlands in a final warm-up Thursday, also in Dallas. The Canadians have been drawn in Group A with No. 1 India, No. 7 Pakistan, No. 11 Ireland and the 19th-ranked U.S. After the Americans, Canada will meet Ireland on June 7 and Pakistan on June 11, with both games in suburban New York, before wrapping up Group A play against India on June 15 in Lauderhill, Fla. The top two teams in each group move on to the Super Eights, to be played in Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The two top teams from each pool in the Super Eight then move on to the semifinals in Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago on June 26 and 27, respectively. The final will be held June 29 at the Kensington Oval in Barbados. First-round matches in the U.S. will be split between Nassau County International Cricket Stadium (New York), Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium (Dallas) and Broward County Stadium (Lauderhill). West Indies, which hosted the event in 2010, will hold matches at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium (Antigua and Barbuda), Kensington Oval (Barbados), Guyana National Stadium (Guyana), Daren Sammy Cricket Ground (Saint Lucia), Arnos Vale (Saint Vincent and The Grenadines) and Brian Lara Cricket Academy (Trinidad and Tobago). The Canadians qualified for their first T20 World Cup in October, defeating Bermuda by 39 runs to win the four-team ICC Men's T20 World Cup Americas Region Final. Canada and Bermuda both finished with 4-1-0 records with one no-result. But Canada, which lost to Bermuda by 86 runs in its opening match, won the tournament by a superior net run rate (3.98 to 2.41).

        "content": "TROY, N.Y. — Troy’s Memorial Day Parade returned Monday for the first time since 2020. The city also had a ceremony honoring veterans that afternoon at Powers Park. “It builds pride in our city; it builds pride in our neighborhoods,” first-year Mayor Carmella Mantello said on why they needed to bring it back. “Yes, parades are great, but it’s also what’s behind that parade, and today (it’s a) very very special meaning to really — we hope we do it every day — but to go out of our way to say thank you to all of our veterans.” The parade started at Knickerbacker Park and ran through the streets of Lansingburgh before ending at Powers Park, with residents of all ages on the street to meet them. Though it started to rain as the procession reached Powers Park, the sun managed to stay out for most of the journey. Fire trucks, police cars, sports clubs, and bands made their way, tossing candy, blowing bubbles, and waving American flags as they went. The mostly local groups and schools were also joined by Canadian infantry — the Lincoln and Welland Regiment from the Niagara Region of Ontario. The group has a history with the Veterans of Lansingburgh and attended the Memorial Day Parade for 20 years before its pause prior to the pandemic. The paraders ranged from local politicians and officials to the Ancient Order of Hibernians — joined on their float by Uncle Sam and Betsey Mann — to someone from Joseph’s House & Shelter in a dinosaur costume walking a dog. There was also, of course, a van coated in New York Giants memorabilia down to an inflated player on the back that got some cheers as it went by. “I think we haven’t had any, much exposure down in Lansingburgh, you know, and think it’s just a great opportunity,” said Sidewalk Warriors Troy President Robin Fontanelli about why they and their new refrigerator van were taking to the streets. “It’s really exciting so we wanted to be part of the excitement, The parade at 1 p.m. was just one of the events arranged for the day, starting with a street sign unveiling and ending with a block-party cookout at Forty-One Sports Bar & Grille. The street sign was for Peter Guenette Lane, the street next to Knickerbacker Park dedicated to a fallen soldier who sacrificed his life in Vietnam. A 20-year-old Specialist Fourth Class machine gunner in the Army, Guenette dove on an enemy grenade thrown toward his company while under heavy fire, saving four men. Born in Troy and a Medal of Honor recipient for his act, Mantello said the city was alerted the sign was missing a few months ago, and they unveiled a new one on Monday morning with members of Guenette’s family. “You (hear) the story of Peter, and you know there’s a million stories similar to Peter,” Mantello said. “(Memorial Day) it’s to really take time out of our day to say thank you, to say thank you for our freedom.” A Lansingburgh native, Mantello said she remembers hearing about Guenette and understanding even at her age the weight of a young person giving their life. The parade itself, she said, also brings back memories of watching and being in parades. There is so much pride tied into the day and pride in the city of Troy for themselves, for their city, and for the men and women who have served for them, she said. It brings a feeling of camaraderie and family to Troy. “We’re so proud to bring back Memorial Day, not just the parade but more importantly our veterans ceremony and to really pay respect to the folks who just gave us what we have today,” Mantello said. “We’re proud of our city, we’re proud of our veterans and, you know, today is going to be a great day for Troy.”",

There is so much pride tied into the day and pride in the city of Troy for themselves, for their city, and for the men and women who have served for them, she said. It brings a feeling of camaraderie and family to Troy. “We’re so proud to bring back Memorial Day, not just the parade but more importantly our veterans ceremony and to really pay respect to the folks who just gave us what we have today,” Mantello said. “We’re proud of our city, we’re proud of our veterans and, you know, today is going to be a great day for Troy.”",

        "content": "The sports world was met with sad news today, May 27: Bill Walton, basketball hall-of-famer and NBA legend, after a battle with cancer. This is a noteworthy loss for the music world, too: If you know two things about Walton aside from his basketball achievements, one is that he had an unceasingly optimistic and offbeat personality. The other is that he was perhaps the world’s biggest (both in terms of enthusiasm and physical size) Grateful Dead fan. Naturally, when — an offshoot band featuring some original Grateful Dead members, , and others — launched nearly a decade ago, Walton was all in. This means Mayer has gotten to know Walton a bit, and back in 2023, he spoke about his experiences with the sports icon. Mayer was Walton’s guest on an interview-style NBA broadcast in January 2023, and he reminisced about Walton speaking to him before taking the stage for a Dead & Company show. It was very Bill Walton. Mayer said, “You know, it’s really just him being very laser-sharp. When Bill gives you advice, he looks you dead in the eye and everything stops, and he speaks with this cadence: ‘Go out there, give it your absolute all. Don’t be shy, they are here to watch you play. Go play to the greatest of your ability.'” \"Some of the greatest compliments I've ever been given were from Bill Walton.\" John Mayer on the advice and support Bill has shared with him over the years. 📲 — NBA (@NBA) Mayer also noted that Walton gave him “some of the greatest compliments I’ve ever been given,” including “some very nice things that sent me on stage with a lot of confidence.” Dead & Company, by the way, is in the midst of . Check out the Mayer/Walton clip above and revisit more of the broadcast below. Basketball fans have also been sharing their favorite clips of Walton, so find some of those .",

        "content": "JAZZ Jennings has shown she's confident in her body as she flaunted her body transformation in new photos. The TLC star posted a couple of snapshots on Instagram of her donning a swimsuit while enjoying the warm weather. In one pic, Jazz, 23, captured an up-close shot of her sporting a plunging black bathing suit while basking in the sunshine. She stared directly at the camera with her long brunette locks flowing down her back. A second pic showed Jazz smiling alongside her friend, Sam, while seemingly at a playground. Sam also rocked a black outfit and her brown hair fell to her shoulders. \"Radiate Love,\" Jazz wrote in her caption before giving a shoutout to her \"best friend.\" \"Oh god u r magnificent,\" one fan commented, while another gushed over her \"beautiful\" appearance. The YouTuber has been regularly flaunting her thinner figure on social media since dropping 70 pounds. Last month, the Florida native showcased her smaller waistline , by sharing a full-body photo of her sporting tiny shorts and a t-shirt. She noted in her caption that she was \"improving every day,\" which fans, including her older brother Sander, praised in the comments. \"Looking amazing! So proud of you for reaching towards your progress goals and continuing to work to be the healthiest and happiest version of you,\" her 26-year-old sibling wrote. The I Am Jazz star has been vocal about her health journey after gaining weight due to binge eating. Jazz previously revealed she packed on more than 100 pounds after turning to food to deal with her depression battle. \"I gained weight and more weight and more weight. And now, almost 100 lbs. heavier, here I am today,\" the TV personality said during a 2021 confessional interview on her show. \"I do experience fat-shaming from my family,\" she admitted, and added that it made her \"feel really humiliated.\" I gained weight and more weight and more weight. And now, almost 100 lbs. heavier, here I am today. Earlier that year, Jazz opened up on Instagram about her \"addiction to food\" and how she would typically \"eat in large quantities.\" The TV star appears to have a much better relationship with her body . In January, she beamed in another Instagram pic that she was \"feeling sexy\" while wearing a revealing black and white top. Shortly before, Jazz confessed to her followers that she was ready to be in a relationship after being single for five years. \"I'm so open to finding love, and I know it'll come,\" she shared after a fan inquired about her love life. \"I'll continue to be patient in the knowing that it'll happen when I'm ready,\" the spokesmodel added. Jazz rose to fame after starring in TLC's reality series, I Am Jazz, which documented her navigating through her teenage years as a transgender female. She also wrote about her experiences in her memoir, Being Jazz: My Life as a (Transgender) Teen, and is an LGBT rights activist.",

Making this assertion while speaking on Channels Politics Today on Monday, Tanko disclosed that Obi was not interested in a merger that its sole interest was to seek power.

Tanko said, “He (Obi) is so passionate about seeing Nigeria work, not passionate about only getting power. “His Excellency Peter Gregory Obi is not interested in a merger that is only for the interest of seeking power; He is interested in a merger that will bring Nigeria out of the poverty level, bringing the Nigerian people to a comfortable state of healthcare, making sure that Nigerians have access to portable drinking water, making sure Nigerians have problems of power supply being solved. He is highly interested strongly on a merger that is driven by ideology and programs but if it is only for the purpose of power he is not interested.” Tanko’s comment comes just as opposition parties are considering merger options as the quest to unseat the ruling All Progressives Congress continues to mount in the build-up to the 2027 general elections.",

        "content": "By STEPHANIE LIECHTENSTEIN (Associated Press) VIENNA — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran’s attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to have economic sanctions imposed over the country’s controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing the program down. The program — as all matters of state in Iran — are under the guidance of Iran’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and that likely won’t change in the wake of last week’s helicopter crash that killed Iran’s president and foreign minister. The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency also comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Israel and Iran have carried out direct strikes on each other’s territory for the first time last month. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said that as of May 11, Iran has 313.2 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 45.4 pounds since the last report by the U.N. watchdog in February . Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. By IAEA’s definition, around 92.5 pounds of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further, to 90%. Also as of May 11, the report says Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 1,3671.5 pounds, which represents an increase of 1,489.8 pounds since the IAEA’s previous report. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi , has previously warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the U.N. agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. Under the original nuclear deal, struck in 2015, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. The 2015 deal saw Tehran agree to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for generating nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At the time, U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. Monday’s report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar IAEA inspectors from further monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.” According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran’s decision to bar inspectors — and a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.” The deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA’s talks with Tehran over improving cooperation, the report acknowledged. Before the May 19 helicopter crash, Iran had agreed to hold technical negotiations with IAEA on May 20, following a visit by Grossi earlier in the month. But those meetings fell apart due to the crash. Iran then sent a letter on May 21, saying its nuclear team wants to continue discussions in Tehran “on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon,” the report said. The report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA’s years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. It said the IAEA’s request need to be resolved, otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations” under a safeguards agreement between Tehran and the nuclear watchdog. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA said that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.”",

        "content": "RALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN) – Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson (R) said Republicans “were right about HB2” as he spoke to supporters at a recent campaign event. Robinson made the comments at a private lunch hosted by RNC National Committeeman Ed Broyhill. Broyhill posted an 18-minute video of . Robinson, who is running for governor, was referring to the controversial House Bill 2, which the Republican-led General Assembly passed in 2016. It required people to use the bathroom that corresponded to their gender at birth and blocked municipalities from passing non-discrimination ordinances. The law sparked national backlash as some companies dropped plans to bring jobs to the state and some major events, such as the NBA All-Star Game, were moved out of North Carolina. A few months after Gov. Roy Cooper (D) was elected in 2016, the legislature partially repealed the law. An found the law cost the state more than $3.76 billion over 12 years in lost business. “We were right about HB2. We told them. You start letting these men go in these bathrooms, the next thing you know. What’s the next step after that? That’s exactly what we said. What’s the next step after that? Guess what the next step was: your daughter losing her scholarship to a biological man in swimming, volleyball, basketball,” Robinson said. “We were right on HB2 and continue to be right on it. The ideas that the left has is a bunch of foolishness. We don’t need to be ashamed to say it.” Robinson’s comments on HB2 came as he was trying to draw a contrast with Democrats, including his opponent in the race Atty. Gen. Josh Stein. Robinson said his campaign would focus on issues like lowering taxes, improving the business climate and education, while he said “the left” would “try to drag him into issues” like House Bill 2. “These folks are coming after you. I say, ‘I’m not worried about them.’ They say, ‘Well, you don’t look worried. Why are you not worried?’ Why in the world should I be worried about what somebody who thinks that there’s 257 genders thinks of me? I don’t care what you think of me. I don’t care,” said Robinson. When asked if Robinson would support reinstating provisions of House Bill 2, campaign spokesperson Mike Lonergan said, “Radical leftists like Joe Biden and Josh Stein want to force women and girls to share restrooms and locker rooms with men. That’s dangerous and extreme. As governor, Mark Robinson will not allow that to happen. It’s just common sense.” Stein campaign spokesperson Morgan Hopkins responded, “Mark Robinson would repeat the failures of HB2: thousands of jobs lost, companies fleeing the state, and billions in losses for North Carolina’s economy. We’ve been down this road before, and it’s a dead end. Josh Stein’s vision for North Carolina is forward-looking and will create a welcoming economic climate for workers and businesses.”",

        "description": "Iran has bolstered its supply of enriched uranium, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog reportedly warned in a confidential report Monday.",
        "content": "Iran has reportedly further built up its supply of enriched uranium , the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog warned in a confidential report Monday. Tehran has about 313.2 pounds of uranium that is enriched up to 60%, marking a 45.4-pound increase since the last report from the International Atomic Energy Agency back in February, the Associated Press reported . Once a nation stockpiles roughly 92.5 pounds of uranium that’s enriched up to 60%, making a nuclear becomes theoretically possible, according to the agency. That is not far away from the weapons-grade level, which generally is pegged around 90% purity. Overall, Iran’s stash of enriched uranium is believed to be around 13,671.5 pounds, up from 1,489.8 pounds in the prior agency report, according to the AP. Iran has long strenuously denied allegations that it is pursuing a nuclear weapon, with top officials citing a supposed fatwa — or ruling in Islamic law — from its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Western experts have long questioned that alleged fatwa and raised concerns that Tehran could have its sights set on becoming a nuclear power. Should Iran obtain a nuclear weapon, it could spark a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, as many Arab nations such as Saudi Arabia have suggested they would scramble to develop one in response. Iran has pushed the envelope when it comes to nuclear development as it suffers under the weight of an onslaught of crippling economic sanctions and the end of a US-backed nuclear deal. The Obama administration reached the deal in 2015, but former President Donald Trump withdrew from the pact in 2018. That deal entailed the easing of sanctions in exchange for Iran setting limits on its nuclear program that would be phased out over time. President Biden’s administration has long been rumored to be eyeing a revival of that deal, but so far, nothing has come to fruition. Instead, relations have been strained amid the Israel-Hamas war. Both Iran and Israel exchanged attacks last month after the US ally allegedly took out a senior Quds Force commander as well as other Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officers during a strike in Syria. Recently, Iran has been reeling from a helicopter crash that killed President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian incident earlier this month. Upon the death of Raisi — who was widely seen as a top contender to succeed Khamenei as supreme leader— Mohammad Mokhber became Iran’s acting president. The death of Raisi paused the agency’s talks with Iran on getting better cooperation, according to the AP account of the most recent report. The watchdog is reportedly still seeking answers about the origins and location of undeclared manmade uranium particles in Iran. Agency officials also claim that no additional progress has been made in trying to install more robust monitoring equipment inside Iran, since they had been taken down in June 2022 . Back in September 2023, Iran prohibited multiple nuclear inspectors. Tehran has yet to reverse that decision. With Post wires",

        "content": "MARCUS Rashford has announced that he will be taking a break from social media for a \"few weeks\" after a challenging season. The Manchester United forward revealed his decision tonight on a post on X, formerly Twitter . The Premier League ace reminded critics that United \"always stick together\". He wrote: \"It's time to come off Socials for a few weeks. \"I plan to rest and reset mentally after a challenging season individually and collectively. \"Thanks to the fans that stood by me through a difficult period. \"To the ones that didn’t just remember at United, we always stick together.\" Fans were quick to comment after the star revealed he was coming off social media. One said: \"Marcus Rashford will come back stronger!\" Another wrote: \"Best thing for him tbh, get his head down and work harder than ever.\" Rashford started the FA Cup final after missing a few games through injury in what was his first start since the semi-final victory over Coventry on April 21. And the Red Devils star played a massive role for his club in a magnificent 2-1 victory over Manchester City at Wembley on Saturday. With United leading 1-0, Rashford pinged a brilliant ball out to Alejandro Garnacho, who picked out Bruno Fernandes to tee up Kobbie Mainoo for the second. Mainoo's goal stunned the Premier League champions before the break with the Red Devils fully deserving to be in front. Jeremy Doku scored a late goal to give City a lifeline but United held on to win Ten Hag a trophy in what could be his final game in charge. As the final whistle rang, Rashford was seen breaking down in tears after a disappointing season ended with silverware. Captain Bruno Fernandes also broke down whilst discussing Erik ten Hag 's future at full-time. Following the win, players and staff celebrated in the dressing room , with footage showing the post-match scenes. In a video shared to the club's official Instagram , Marcus Rashford can be seen smiling and jumping up and down. He also joined team-mate Lisandro Martinez in song to the delight of supporters. The local lad has been linked with an exit this summer but there have been plenty of calls for him to stay. Paris Saint-Germain have previously held interest in the United academy graduate. The forward has been omitted from Gareth Southgate 's provisional 33-man Euro 2024 squad. It will give him time to rest and reset ahead of Manchester United's next campaign.",

        "content": "For police, the lowest pay rate for a sworn officer was $75,063 - the lowest level since 2007 compared to CPI. File photo: RNZ By Susan Edmunds Police and teachers are currently being paid their lowest rates compared to the minimum or average wage in at least 20 years. Infometrics economists have crunched the numbers on pay for teachers, nurses and police. Earlier in the year, chief forecaster Gareth Kiernan had noted that MPs were being paid their lowest salary compared to the average wage since the 1970s, before their latest pay increase. The data showed all three sectors' pay was comparatively lower on a range of measures compared to the past, too. \"Compared to historical norms, police pay looks particularly poor, and teachers don't look that good, either,\" Kiernan said. \"Nurses don't appear to be quite so bad, although the recent figures are inflated by the pay equity settlement. If you exclude that from the figures, on the basis that nurses were previously being underpaid because it was a female-dominated profession, then their pay isn't great either.\" For police, the lowest pay rate for a sworn officer was $75,063 - the lowest level since 2007 compared to CPI. Compared to average wages, it was at the lowest point of any time since 2003 and possibly since 1969. It was 41 percent lower than the high point in 1981. Compared to the minimum wage, it was lower than at any time since 2003 and possibly since 1967. It was 63 percent lower than in 1981. Police officers have been involved in a pay dispute but were expected to have a new pay offer confirmed by the end of August. Kiernan said secondary school teachers' income relative to the CPI was the lowest in June last year - just before their latest pay increase - since 2006. The post-primary teachers association (PPTA) said most of its teachers were paid at the top of the pay scale, which was $99,216 a year, going up to $103,085 in December. \"Over the longer-term, teachers' pay has been reasonably stable compared to the CPI, and the pay increase set to come into effect from December this year should push inflation-adjusted pay up to a level that is higher than was seen at any time between December 1986 and June 2020,\" Kiernan said. \"That outcome sounds great for teachers, but if we compare teachers' pay to either the average wage or the minimum wage, it's a different story. In June 2023, teachers' pay relative to either of these variables was at its lowest on record, since 1980. Even with the subsequent pay increases that have occurred and/or will occur in December this year, teachers' pay relative to the average wage or the minimum wage will still be lower than at any time before June 2019.\" He said the teacher pay situation could be leading to wider problems. \"New Zealand's poor educational outcomes and persistently poor productivity results, in combination with pay rates that are continuing to decline relative to other wages and salary, potentially become something of a chicken-and-egg problem. \"One can't expect good educational outcomes without good teachers, but good people won't be attracted to the profession or retained as teachers without good pay either - and primary and secondary education doesn't seem to be an area where investment in capital equipment, automation, or economies of scale are going to make a significant positive impact. Of course, there are other big issues as well such as the curriculum, assessment methods, and the incentives to teach to the median student's ability rather than taking a more tailored approach to student needs.\" Kiernan said before the pay equity boost that started in 2021, nurses' pay was at its lowest level compared to the minimum wage in all of the available data. \"The pay equity boost pushed nurses' pay in 2022 up to its highest level, relative to the average wage, on record. However, relative to the minimum wage, it was only at its highest level since 2016.\" The nurse pay cited was $75,773. \"I wonder whether one of the key aspects of each of these professions is that there is limited scope for improved labour productivity and/or greater capital intensiveness,\" Kiernan said. \"At its simplest, a teacher can only achieve significant 'productivity' improvements by having more students per class; a nurse by having more patients under their care; a police officer by covering a wider area. I can think of how technological advances might have made some of these changes possible - electronic monitoring of patients would require less human supervision of patients in hospital, for example. \"But my impression is that the advances will have been more constrained than across many other occupations, where computers have had a significant effect on people's output over the last 40 years,\" he said. \"As a result, average wages at an economy-wide level might have been able to lift faster because people have been more productive, and the mix of jobs in the economy has also changed towards higher-skilled and higher-paid ones. This trend might have meant that specific occupations with a high human element to them have been left behind a bit, relatively speaking, in terms of their pay rates. \"It's a difficult situation, because as we saw during Covid-19, people seem to implicitly value the human nature of those roles when the going gets tough - but the pay rates don't necessarily reflect that.\"",

        "content": "KUWAIT: Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdullah Al-Yahya on Monday held in-depth discussions with Chinese officials dealing with means of boosting relations in execution of mega development ventures. The minister, according to a statement released by the foreign ministry, received Chinese Ambassador to Kuwait Zhang Jianwei, with the attendance of the head and members of a Chinese government delegation tasked with completing consultation on joint development projects. The meeting with the visiting Chinese officials was held at the ministry headquarters, the official statement said, noting that the two sides explored the close bilateral relations and strategic cooperation between Kuwait and China, where they also broached “frameworks of boosting and promoting the relations in various sectors and at diverse levels”. The two sides held in-depth discussions, focusing on the necessity to cement technical, development and economic ties in the realm of executing mega development projects in Kuwait. Moreover, they addressed the need to offer proposals and the aspired perceptions for attaining aspirations of the supreme political leadership to press ahead with laying the foundations of a future plan to launch common strategic ventures, namely Mubarak Al-Kabeer Port. — KUNA China will host a number of other Arab leaders in Beijing this week, its foreign ministry said Monday. The leaders will from Tuesday to Saturday “pay state visits to China and attend the opening ceremony of the 10th Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum”, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement. Among the delegation will be Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, Tunisian President Kais Saied and the United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan. Speaking at a press conference in Beijing, Vice Foreign Minister Deng Li said President Xi Jinping would attend the forum and deliver a keynote address on Thursday. Xi would also “hold talks with the four heads of state respectively to exchange views on bilateral relations and regional and international issues of common concern”, Deng said. The forum would aim to deepen “consensus between China and Arab countries”, Deng said, and would be co-chaired by top diplomat Wang Yi and his Mauritanian counterpart. They would also “issue a common voice between China and Arab countries on the Palestinian issue”, he said. China has sought to build closer ties with Arab states in recent years, and last year brokered a detente between Tehran and its long-time foe Saudi Arabia. The meeting with Arab leaders in Beijing comes as China seeks to position itself as a mediator in the conflict between the Palestinian group Hamas and the Zionist entity. China has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Zionist-Palestinian conflict. And Xi has called for an “international peace conference” to resolve the fighting. – Agencies",

        "content": ", Sports Correspondent YachtingNZ is accused of mishandling its Olympic selections afterone of its star crews was picked for the Paris Games,despite failing to meet the required performancestandard. Jo Aleh and Molly Meech, who paired up inthe 49erFX class at the beginning of 2022, headlined theannouncement of the New Zealand sailing team for the Gameslast month. With five previous Games appearances and threeOlympic medals between them, the pair are the mostexperienced of the . But according to YachtingNZ's selection documents, the duo were not eligible to beconsidered for nomination, having failed to achieve a top 10placing at one of the designated selection regattas. Theselection was signed off by the New Zealand OlympicCommittee (NZOC). Both organisations are adamantproper process was followed in the nomination and selectionof the pair. However, Yachting NZ's apparentwillingness to contort its criteria for Aleh and Meech,along with a perceived inconsistent application of the\"emerging talent\" clause, has led to several disputes overits handling of selections and allegations ofbias. Yachting NZ has long maintained a cloak ofsecrecy around how it selects its athletes for the OlympicGames. It is the only national body that does not publiclyshare its nomination criteria - contravening the NZOC'snomination and selection regulation - and sailors wishing tobe considered for the pinnacle event must agree to keep itconfidential. However, RNZ has obtained a copy of theselection documents. New Zealand's sailors must clearan even higher bar than the NZOC's already lofty \"top 16\"criteria to be nominated for selection. Under its primaryselection criteria, Yachting NZ selectors will only nominateathletes deemed capable of winning a medal. To beeligible, sailors and crews must have, as a baseline,achieved a top 10 placing in at least one selection regatta,or have medalled at a world championships during thatOlympic cycle. There is a second pathway for sailorsor crews that Yachting NZ selectors consider to be \"emergingtalent\" and have the potential to medal at the next Olympicsin Los Angeles in 2028. Under these criteria, sailors needto finish in the top 16 nations at one of the selectionregattas to be eligible. Aleh and former sailingpartner Polly Powrie, affectionately known as Team Jolly,won gold in the women's 470 in London and silver inRio. Meech was also , alongside teammate Alex Maloneyin the 49erFX class. The popular duo went their separateways following a disappointing 12th place finish inTokyo. Meech then linked up with Aleh at the beginningof 2022 to form Team Jolly 2.0. Despite theircredentials, the new pairing have produced mixed results onthe international circuit. In the first of twoselection regattas, Aleh and Meech placed 34th at theEuropean Championships in Portugal last year - well outsidethe top 10 benchmark - before recording a 12th at the WorldChampionships earlier this year. Prior to being namedin the Games team last month, the duo had recorded just onetop 10 result at a major international regatta intwo-and-a-half seasons - a . It isunderstood selectors relied heavily on this result, despiteit not being an official selection regatta. Under thecriteria, selectors can also consider \"a sailor or crew'strack record of success at past Olympic Games\". However,those familiar with the policy say these factors only comeinto play in final deliberations once sailors have met theunderlying eligibility criteria. RNZ has spoken withseveral past and present members of the NZL sailing team,who expressed concern about Yachting NZ's handling of thisyear's selections. None wanted to go on the record for fearof being seen to diminish Aleh and Meech. All made apoint of saying they would not have wanted to see the 49erFXpair left out of the Olympic team, but a recurring theme ofthe conversations was that Yachting NZ's perceivedinconsistent approach to its selections has created distrustin the system. Aleh did not want to be drawn into thedebate over the merits of her inclusion in the team, buttold RNZ via text message that she is \"very pro-selection,having had close friends impacted by selection policies inthe past\". \"In terms of the YNZ policy we were happyto be selected and for us it was just a little step on theway to what we are trying to do in Paris. So our focus isvery much on making sure we are doing everything we can overthe next few months,\" she wrote. Since being named inthe Olympic team, Aleh and Meech had a breakthrough resultlast month at French Olympic Week in Hyeres, claiming thebronze medal - a promising sign the pair are beginning toperfect their partnership. But it is clear on anyone'sreading of the criteria that Yachting NZ have applied anextraordinary amount of discretion to include Aleh and Meechin the team. In a brief statement provided to RNZ,Yachting NZ boss David Abercrombie said the organisationdoes not publicly comment on individual nominations, but allsailors and crews were selected in line with its policies.The nomination of athletes \"follows a rigorous process ledby an independent panel with a wealth of sailing expertiseand experience\". NZOC secretary general Nicki Nicolalso asserted proper process was followed. \"Allselections are made by an experienced selection panel.Decisions are evidence based and athletes nominated by[national sports organisations] are assessed by the NZOCselectors against the agreed nomination criteria and theNZOC selection policy,\" she said in astatement. The discretion used to pick Aleh and Meechappears not to have been as readily available toothers. RNZ understands at least one sailor -kitefoiler Lukas Walton-Keim - has lodged a formal appealwith the Sports Tribunal over his non-nomination in the newOlympic class. Walton-Keim is the partner of Olympicpole vaulter Eliza McCartney, who last weekend spoke outabout the NZOC's controversial \"top 16\" selection policy,arguing qualified athletes should not be denied entry to theOlympics. It is understood Walton-Keim's case will beheard this week, unless a resolution can be reached in themeantime. All parties agree to confidentiality when acase is before the tribunal, but it is understoodWalton-Keim is seeking nomination under the \"emergingtalent\" clause. Two athletes have been selected underthis criteria - boardsailor Veerle ten Have in the women'sIQ foil, and Greta Pilkington, who is expected to beconfirmed in Ilca 6 at an official announcement on Tuesdaymorning. Ten Have finished 22nd and 21st overall ather two selection events, but was easily inside the top 16nations for both events. Pilkington had a shaky startto her campaign, recording 53rd and 44th placings in thefirst two selection events earlier this year, before pullingit out of the bag in the final event in Hyeres last month.There the 20 year-old finished 16th, and 14thnation. It is expected Walton-Keim's case will focuson the inconsistent application of the \"emerging talent\"clause. Walton-Keim finished 28th, 17th, and 27th athis three selection regattas. His 17th placing at theEuropean Championships last year put him inside the top 16nations. While not official selection regattas, the 28year-old is also tracking strongly at recent events. Hefinished 11th at French Olympic Week in Hyeres, or ninthnation, and 17th at the Formula Kite world championships(15th nation) earlier this week. Following the event,Walton-Keim posted on Instagram: \"I'm not sure what's next,I'd like to do some more racing in 2024 ... let'ssee.\" One former international sailor said thegoverning body's flexibility is at odds with its \"rigid\"approach in the past to not only Olympic nomination, butalso funding decisions and selection to its \"Fast Track\"development programme. \"YNZ will follow the rules tothe absolute letter when it suits them. We're always beingtold, 'Well, the policy is very clear,' but then when theywant to get someone in the team, suddenly there is all thisgrey area,\" they said. Abercrombie did not directlyaddress questions related to whether he has concerns aboutperceptions of bias and growing distrust in the system. Butin a statement, he said Yachting NZ's policies are\"transparent and available to every athlete throughout theircampaigns\". The long-serving chief executive of theorganisation also said the current policy was \"developedafter an athlete-led review following the Tokyo OlympicGames\" and athletes will continue to be involved in refiningthe policy for future cycles. Nicol also ignoredquestions about whether the NZOC had any concerns aboutYachting NZ's handling of selections. \"While we arenot able to comment on individual cases, we do understandhow tough it is for athletes that may not have beennominated by their sport for selection to an NZTeam.\" It is not the first time questions have beenraised about Yachting NZ's approach to selections forpinnacle events. In 2016 Sara Winther (laser radial) andNatalia Kosinska (RS:X) over their non-nominationfor the Rio Games. While the tribunal ultimately ruledin favour of Yachting NZ, the then-chair of the arbitrationbody Sir Bruce Robertson was highly critical of the sport'shandling of selections. \"I have concerns about theinadequacy of communication by YNZ to both athletes. Whilethe selection policy is drafted to provide huge discretionto YNZ, this does not obviate its obligations to abide bythe rules of natural justice and to ensure basic fairness inits implementation,\" Sir Bruce wrote in hisdecision.",

        "description": "Sue Bird can relate to Caitlin Clark’s losing predicament, coming off a UConn career where she won two NCAA titles and only lost four games in college. Both were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft 22 years apart, landing on last-place teams.",
        "content": "NEW YORK — Sue Bird can relate to Caitlin Clark’s early frustrations about losing in the WNBA. But the former UConn women’s basketball all-time great knows from experience how things could change for the much-talked about rookie. Now 43, Bird came out of UConn where she won two NCAA titles and only lost four games. Clark led her Iowa team to consecutive NCAA Championship games while becoming the NCAA Division I career scoring leader. Both were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft — 22 years apart — and landed on last-place teams. Clark’s Indiana Fever have just one win in their first seven games. Bird, who eventually won four WNBA titles with Seattle, recommends patience for Clark. She recently watched courtside when New York beat Clark and Indiana before more than 17,000 fans at the Barclays Center. Now a part-owner of the Storm, Bird joins Lisa Leslie (LA Sparks) and Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream) as former WNBA players turned owners. Bird thinks more lucrative broadcast rights contracts and an improved collective bargaining agreement will “dramatically” change the WNBA landscape in the next few years. That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster. Clark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro. However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000. The NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick Victor Wembanyama earned $12.1 million in his rookie season. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State’s Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year. Bird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women’s Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity: Ways the WNBA can grow: Larger rosters, more teams, a G League? Bird: If I’m being honest, we’ve done our part (as players). The product on the floor has never been better. Now it’s the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you’re going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there’s a soft cap — now we’re talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year — so by 2026, it could be dramatically different. What about the expense argument against a WNBA G League? Bird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don’t have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas. Talk about the impact of NIL and how it elevates the brand of athletes? Bird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out — the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it’s just growing pains. I’m sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world — the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There’s a popularity and you’re connecting with a brand. There’s no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way. You’ve done TV commentary with Diana Taurasi, but what’s been the most fun about your post-basketball career? Bird: Just being able to do what I want. It’s nice to not have to worry that I have to eat by 4 p.m. because my game is at 7 p.m. They see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and that’s exactly what we’d be doing if we were at home with no cameras. We’re trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in terms of coverage, having women cover the sport and former athletes cover the sport.",

        "description": "Love Island star Ekin-Su Culculoglu was one of the stars taking part in ITV's 2024 season of Celebrity Big Brother - but things did not turn out well for her during her time on the show",
        "content": "Ekin-Su Culculoglu has addressed the fact she failed to turn up to the grand final of ITV ’s revived Celebrity Big Brother earlier this year. The 29-year-old Love Island star was one of the 13 celebrities that entered the Most Famous House In Britain in March and she had high hopes of being able to show a new side of herself to fans. Plans backfired somewhat, however, as Ekin-Su sparked bitter arguments in the house, appeared obsessed with not being recognised for her Love Island fame, and clashed with show hosts AJ Odudu and Will Best after she was voted out of the house as she tried to blame producer’s editing the show to make her look bad. Now Ekin-Su has opened up about her disastrous turn on the series and says she couldn’t make it to the live final as she was struggling to cope with bombshell news that ex-boyfriend Davide Sanclimenti, 29, had cheated on her. The British-Turkish actress has conceded that her time in the house was nothing short of a disaster, but has rejected the suggestion that this was the reason behind her finale no-show. In the last episode of the season, where Ibiza Weekender star David Potts , 31, was crowned winner, former housemates were invited to return to review their time on the show. Businessman Gary Goldsmith was also absent from the finale, but there is speculation his decision to not appear was down to his niece, Catherine, Princess of Wales , battling cancer. Ekin-Su's time on the reality show was tarred by bitter arguments ( Image: ITV1) Virgin Media offers gamers the chance to get £250 but you'll need to act quickly Speaking to The Sun, Ekin-Su said: “I should never have gone into the Big Brother house. I was angry, hurt, maybe a bit bitter, definitely insecure – Big Brother is not where you go to heal heartache, let me tell you. I went into the show thinking that I could rebuild myself after everything that happened with Davide, but I came off worse. My guard was up.” She continued: “I blame myself for making a poor choice in my career. People could see that I wasn’t myself, and I can understand why they thought I was being fake.” And she added: “I never wanted to believe the allegations against Davide but people would tell me I was being cheated on all the time. I was so scared of being alone, and I didn’t know who the hell Ekin-Su was meant to be without him.” Cheating accusations have ruined the once strong romance on both sides. As fans will already be aware, Ekin-Su and Davide won the eighth season Love Island in 2022 and their romance flourished outside of the house. However, their relationship turned sour after 11 months and they broke up. Davide has accused Ekin-Su of cheating on him with a fellow contestant on the USA version of The Traitors which sees celebrities taking on tasks and trying to avoid betrayal. It has been alleged that Ekin-Su developed a romance with The Bachelorette star Peter Weber on the show - an accusation she has fiercely rejected. Hitting out at the suggestion on Monday, Ekin-Su said: “It’s absolutely not true. I made friends with a lot of people I was with on Traitors. I’ve always been a faithful to Davide.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads.",

        "content": "By Curtis Williams HOUSTON (Reuters) - Trinidad and Tobago received six bids from BP, Shell and US shale producer EOG Resources on four blocks to explore for oil and gas as its 2023 shallow water auction closed on Monday. Trinidad plans to announce the winners in four months, Energy Minister Stuart Young said at the closing of the auction. All three companies bid for the Modified UC block, which is close to the Teak, Sammaan, Poui producing fields. The auction had no other bidders. Trinidad is Latin America's largest producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), with installed capacity of 15 million metric tons per year of the super-cooled gas. It also is one of the world's biggest exporters of methanol and ammonia, but its plants have been operating below full capacity in recent years due to a lack of gas. In October 2023 the Trinidad government put out 13 blocks for bids. Monday's results mean that nine of the 13 blocks did not receive any interest and all the bids were from companies already operating on the Caribbean island. EOG Resources bid on three blocks, the Modified UC; the Lower Reverse L, which is west of Shell's Manatee discovery and on the border with neighboring Venezuela; and NCMA 4, in an area operated by Shell. Shell had one bid on Modified UC while BP, which bid on Modified UC also placed a bid for NCMA 2 which is north of Trinidad and not in the Columbus basin where the company has operated since the 1970s. Trinidad made several changes to the fiscal terms to attract more bids after the failure of its 2019 bid round, including reducing the tax liability for shallow-water producers, raising cost recovery to 60% from 50%, cutting the windfall tax to 50% from 70%, increasing the exploration period to eight years from six years and lowering the bid fee to $30,000 from $40,000.

        "content": "Prince William and Prince Harry, who used to enjoy very strong bond in the past, are said to be at loggerheads since the Duke said the royal family goodbye to enjoy a new life with his wife Meghan Markle and their children in the US. The Duke of Sussex was over the moon when Meghan was pregnant with their first child, Prince Archie, and couldn't wait to share the news with his brother William and sister-in-law Kate Middleton. William's reaction to Harry's delightful announcement has been revealed by the Duke himself, saying the future King had just four words to say when he told him Meghan was pregnant. Harry, in his memoir Spare, recalled William's response to his happy news and said he smiled and uttered just four words: \"We must tell Kate.\" Harry also detailed Kate Middleton's reaction and said she was overjoyed to hear the news. \"She also gave a big smile and hearty congratulations. They both reacted exactly as I hoped - as I'd wished,\" wrote Harry. He also mentioned how King Charles reacted: \"Just before a drink reception for the bride and groom, we cornered Pa in his study. He was delighted to learn that he was going to be a grandfather for a fourth time; his wide smile warmed me.\" Meghan Markle gave birth to Prince Archie on May 6, 2019 at the Portland Hospital, London. The couple have since gone on to welcome a second child, Princess Lilibet, who was born at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in California, on June 4, 2021.",

        "content": "Freaks, sickos, and perverts the world over breathed a sigh of relief when it was announced in October 2022 that John Waters would be adapting his novel . For one thing, the film would be his first since 2004's Then, it was later revealed that Aubrey Plaza wanted to star in the film, and Waters wanted her to do it, too. It seemed almost too good to be true. And it turns out, maybe it was. In an interview published today , Waters fielded a single question about , and the answer is, frankly, saddening. “Every time I comment on that, some article comes out that causes me , saying we’re making the movie,” Waters says. In short, Roadhouse Pictures optioned a script from him, and he wrote one. “Aubrey [Plaza] likes the script, wants to be in it, I want her to be in it, and every person said, ‘No, we don’t have a penny of the budget.’ That is where it is today. Hopefully that will change. But the answer as of today? That’s it. In short, there has been no actual movement.” Disappointing, but not wholly surprising. For the financially minded, a John Waters flick is hardly a safe return on investment; in the same interview, he mentions how , his 1990 Johnny Depp-led film and one of his more mainstream, has never turned a profit. Beyond that, even a director like Francis Ford Coppola, a man with five Oscars and the director of two films often considered among the greatest of all time, sold his Granted, some elements of that film sound downright Waters-esque, but if a director as established in the mainstream as Coppola is having these issues, it’s no surprise that Waters is, too. If there is a piece of better news from the interview, though, it’s that Waters has ideas for the . “Not a sequel. But there’s been talk of it being a TV show,” Waters says, “which I think would work best, because if it built to a kill once a month... And with political correctness being what it is, it’s perfect! She’d just kill for political correctness!” He goes on to call his “best movie,” in part because of Kathleen Turner and a nice healthy budget. Hopefully, we get to see what happens with Aubrey Plaza and a nice healthy budget.",

Council chiefs face having to repay up to £1.2million in LEZ penalties after a judge ruled they should have been sent by recorded delivery. 2 Drivers may be able to claim back LEZ fines Credit: Alamy 2 Council chiefs face having to repay up to £1.2million in LEZ penalties Credit: Alamy Lord Lake’s verdict last week upheld a decision in favour of Allan Hamilton, from Ayrshire . The motorist took the authority to a tribunal, insisting his £60 fine was invalid because it had been sent by standard mail. After a law chief backed his claim last October, council officials began sending out their penalty notices by tracked post. But the blunder means at least 20,000 fines issued from the start of the scheme last June until November could be challenged. READ MORE LEZ LEZ OF THAT Over 1 MILLION cars to be banned from Scots roads in weeks under hated new laws GRIDLOCKED Hundreds of drivers use our street as car park to avoid LEZ fines - it's a mess Mr Hamilton claimed legal protocol was not followed when he was fined for driving his van into the city. First-tier tribunal adjudicator Alexander Green agreed a record of delivery was a “mandatory requirement”. The council appealed to the Upper Tribunal for Scotland. But Lord Lake told them the service of notices must be “verifiable”. LEZ rules punish drivers of vehicles that don’t meet strict emissions rules with fines rising from £60 to a maximum of £480.

Glasgow city centres Low Emission Zone explained New data has revealed that Glasgow City Council's aim for the LEZ was to reduce emissions by cutting down on vehicles that omit a key pollutant nitrogen dioxide (NO2) into the atmosphere. But fresh stats have shown emissions have actually INCREASED since controversial green-scheme was introduced in June 2023 to prevent older and more polluting motors from entering the city centre. The new data shows how the NO2 level at a key monitoring station for Glasgow has risen in the first quarter of the year compared with the same period - before the LEZ was introduced. CAB FEARS WE told last month how hundreds of black cabs could be forced off the road in a matter of weeks over the LEZ rules. Scottish Tory transport spokesperson Graham Simpson said : \"Nearly a year on from the roll-out of the SNP-Greens' shambolic LEZ, it is clear it is not even meeting its main objective to improve air quailty.\" A Glasgow City Council spokesperson said: \"Levels of air pollution , in particular nitrogen dioxide and particulates, are influenced by a number of factors, including weather patterns. \"The LEZ's initial impact will be assessed as part of a statutory annual progress report later this year, with detailed analysis from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.\" Across January, February and March on Glasgow’s Hope Street the NO2 levels were 44.2 microgrammes per cubic metre, up from 42.5 for the same period in 2023, reports the Mail on Sunday . Another monitoring station near a school in Anderston, on the edge of the LEZ, shows NO2 up by 35 per cent, sparking fears that pollution is simply being \"displaced\" to around the car ban area. These concerns were made in the local authority's own reports ahead of the introduction of the zone.",

        "content": "Mike Tyson is “doing great” after an apparent medical scare while aboard a flight on Sunday, representatives for the former world heavyweight champion have said. According to reports, the 57-year-old was flying from Miami to Los Angeles when he became unwell and appeals were made to find passengers with medical experience to provide assistance. Paramedics then came on board after the plane landed, delaying passengers from disembarking for around 25 minutes. Tyson’s representatives told the New York Post in an email: “Thankfully Mr Tyson is doing great. “He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare up 30 minutes before landing. He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.” Tyson is due to return to the ring when he fights YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul in Dallas on July 20.",

Read unlimited articles for free today: Already have an account? HOUSTON (AP) — When Jose Trevino took a teen leadership class taught by Sherri Davis in high school the New York Yankees catcher couldn’t have imagined the long-lasting impact it would have. “It changed my life,” Trevino told The Associated Press. “She taught me a ton of lessons in high school, life lessons that help to this day.” So, when Davis retired after a 47-year teaching career and started a nonprofit in his hometown of Corpus Christi, Texas, called “ Special Hearts in the Arts ” in 2016 to provide arts education to those with special needs, Trevino quickly became one of the organization’s most important benefactors. This week he’ll give the beloved group another gift to continue its work. Trevino has been selected as the first Most Valuable Philanthropist of the year by the MLBPA Players Trust and is receiving a $5,000 grant for Special Hearts. Trevino was selected for the award over more than a dozen other applicants by a panel of four former players. Amy Hever, the director of the Players Trust, said its focus is to help players create more impact for causes in their communities. “So, this is a way to not only recognize them, but it also raises tremendous awareness for these causes, especially these hyper-local causes and organizations that some would argue are doing the greatest work in their local communities,” Hever said. Davis raved about Trevino’s generosity and the special bond he’s built with the group. Trevino often visits Special Hearts in the offseason and the students rave about meeting him and covet the pictures he’s taken with them. “You’ll never have anyone say anything bad about Jose,” Davis said. “I think he just makes people feel worthy of whatever they do. That’s a Jose thing that he does.” At Special Hearts, students, who range in age from 12-80, take classes in a variety of the arts including dance, theater, music and art. The group performs around the city and has become a favorite of Corpus Christi mayor Paulette M. Guajardo, who invites them to participate in the Fourth of July celebration each year. On Saturday morning, about three dozen Special Hearts performed a sign language version of the song “Love Can Build A Bridge.” Students beamed as they did the number, which they’ve adopted as their theme song. Arts are the focus of the center, but perhaps more important is the confidence participation builds and the community that is forged through the classes. “We don’t say special needs in here,” Davis said. “We say Special Hearts. We never say disabilities. We always say special abilities.” Before each of their performances Davis leads the group in a back-and-forth affirmation. “I always ask them: ‘Who are you?’ And they say: ‘Special Hearts.’ And I say: ‘What do you have? Special abilities?’” Victoria Hinojosa has been a Special Heart for about three years and is the center of the group’s ballet folklorico performances, plays the guitar and takes art classes. When she first joined the group, she told Davis she couldn’t dance because she’s in a wheelchair. “I said: ‘don’t say, I can’t do, say do what you can, how you can,’” Davis said. “And boy, can she swing that skirt.” Hinojosa, who recently began volunteering to help others at the center, can’t overstate the importance of Special Hearts in her life. “I don’t know where I would have been if it wasn’t for Special Hearts,” she said. “It has really made me feel confident in what I do and how I look at things and I love the way I draw now, and it inspires me to do more.” Though he’s often almost 2,000 miles away in New York City, Trevino’s presence is a huge part of Special Hearts. A big photo of him hangs in Davis’ office and posters featuring pictures of him and the students adorn the center. Davis sends him videos of their performances and she recently sent a picture of the group holding a Yankees banner they made with his name on it. “It’s amazing what he’s doing for Special Hearts,” Hinojosa said. “He has really made us all happy, made us really look at ourselves and think we can do whatever we want. We can go out there and perform... and show people what we can do.” Though Davis and the students credit Trevino for his support, he’s quick to point out that the most special heart in the organization is the one belonging to his former teacher. “That’s what it is, it’s her heart,” Trevino said. “Her heart — it’s ginormous. She has a big heart and she’s always looking out for other people.” Idali Duarte Montes, another former student of Davis who now works with her at Special Hearts, agreed. “Without Sherri, of course, this wouldn’t even be here,” she said. “It came completely from her 100%. And all her hard work was what started it. And then everybody, all the love that she exudes and gets from others that want to support and help has brought all that to Special Hearts in the Arts.” Wiliam Rucizka, is another student who is known around Corpus Christi as “Will The Thrill” for his ability to hype up the crowds before performances. Constantly smiling and upbeat, Rucizka enjoys a variety of activities at the center. “We do art, music, theater, dance and ... we do ‘Love Can Build a Bridge’ every day,” he said. “We do celebrating every day.” And because of Trevino’s recent gift, Special Hearts will add a new program. Called “The Remarkables,” the group will dress as superheroes, each with their own special power, and perform at children’s hospitals and nursing homes. Monday mornings The latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week. Though he’s been out of high school for more than a decade, Trevino still leans on things Davis taught him. An important one is a breathing technique that the Gold and Platinum Glove winner uses to slow things down and “really be in the moment” before games. “It’s really cool what Ms. Davis is doing, and I have a lot of respect for her, and I appreciate everything she’s doing,” Trevino said. “I think anybody who’s around Ms. Davis is lucky because she’s just a great person.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB Advertisement Advertisement",

Mere days after he stepped out with best mate and BGT presenting partner in crime Dec Donnelly for this year's BAFTA TV Awards, Ant was by wife Anne-Marie's side as she gave birth to their baby son - Wilder Patrick McPartlin. And the delighted Britain's Got Talent presenter was the one to break the big news on social media. Taking to his and Dec's joint Instagram account, Ant wrote: \"Welcome to the family.

        "content": "Demons May Cry: Leaks about the development of a new Doom game have circulated for years. The latest, unconfirmed rumors suggest a potential reveal date during the upcoming Xbox showcase. Developer id Software and publisher Bethesda Softworks have been busy working on a new game in the Doom franchise for at least four years. This upcoming first-person shooter is expected to be introduced during the Xbox Games Showcase on June 9. A prolific leaker has revealed that the game will be called Doom: The Dark Ages and will transport the Doom Slayer back in time, diverging from the gothic sci-fi settings of the latest installments in the series. Leaker Tom Henderson recently mentioned that the game was previously known as Doom Year Zero , but \"Doom: The Dark Ages\" is expected to be its final name. FPS specialists at id Software started development of The Dark Ages in 2020, shortly after releasing the hyper-kinetic (and hyper-brutal) Doom Eternal on consoles and Windows systems. Also see: Ripping and Tearing: 3 Decades of Doom Unnamed sources have described The Dark Ages as a \"medieval-inspired\" Doom world, which aligns with previous snippets of information about id Software's plans to evolve the series. Microsoft, which now owns Bethesda and the Doom franchise, among others, has stated that the Xbox Games Showcase will reveal new games and updates on the Call of Duty franchise. While Doom hasn't matched the immense popularity of the Call of Duty series in recent years, it remains one of the most profitable brands in the gaming market. Henderson highlighted that an id Software developer claimed in 2020 that Doom Eternal generated over $450 million in revenue for id and Bethesda that year alone. New, unconfirmed leaks about a new game in the Doom universe recently surfaced online, starting with the IDKFA trademark registered by Bethesda's parent company, ZeniMax Media (owned by Microsoft since 2021). A potential Doom-themed reveal during the Xbox Games Showcase was teased earlier this month, and Henderson has now independently verified this rumor. Doom is one of the most storied game franchises ever, with id Software enticing and entertaining fans of the FPS genre (including this humble demon-killing writer) since the early Nineties. Doom Eternal, the latest game in the series, introduced significant innovations in gameplay and visual fidelity thanks to the powerful id Tech 7 game engine.",

        "description": "As ministers have a public spat over Rishi Sunak’s national service plan, Boris Johnson ally Zac Goldsmith has claimed that Tory MPs’ ‘complicity’ is to blame for the election chaos",
        "content": "Zac Goldsmith, who resigned from Rishi Sunak ’s government last year, has hit out at the “complicity” of most Tory MPs in allowing the party to descend into complete chaos less than a week into a general election. The Tory peer, who is a friend and ally of former prime minister Boris Johnson , posted a comment on X (formerly Twitter) warning that most Conservative MPs will lose their seats but that“it is hard to feel sorry for them”. It came as ministers were furiously briefing about their anger over the prime minister calling a snap election without consulting his cabinet first. Only common sense minister Esther McVey and Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris expressed opposition at the cabinet meeting last week when Mr Sunak announced he had been to see the King but others since have privately expressed their anger. Similarly, a public spat has broken out between ministers over Mr Sunak’s weekend announcement that he will reintroduce national service , 61 years since it was scrapped again without consulting his team. First, as revealed by The Independent , Northern Ireland minister Steve Baker publicly distanced himself from the policy in a message to his constituents. Then foreign minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan appeared to contradict home secretary James Cleverly by suggesting 18-year-olds may face fines or imprisonment if they do not agree to join the military or do weekend community work. Deputy chairman James Daly hit back saying that Ms Trevelyan is “not responsible for the policy” and claiming that there will not be any criminal sanctions. But the chaos followed the start of a general election campaign already branded “the worst in history”, where a series of gaffes by the prime minister included giving his address to the nation in the pouring rain without an umbrella while being blasted with the anthem for Tony Blair’s 1997 campaign. He also managed to be interviewed under an exit sign, did an election event at the Titanic Museum in Belfast, and saw scores of Tory MPs run to the exit door to avoid standing again, including cabinet minister Michael Gove. Lord Goldsmith made it clear that he struggled to feel sympathy for a leader who should not have been in office as a result of the downfalls of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. He said: “I understand the anger towards Sunak who has damaged the party almost beyond repair and all but guaranteed the majority of his MPs will lose their job next month. “But it’s hard to muster much sympathy given that none of this would have happened without the complicity of a majority of the party and what is now unfolding was entirely predictable – indeed predicted. “The hope is that when Sunak disappears off to California in a few weeks there are at least some decent MPs left around which to rebuild.” Meanwhile, Labour mocked the Tories for the chaos over the national service policy. Jonathan Ashworth, shadow paymaster general, said: “The Tory campaign is in absolute chaos, with more positions on their flagship policy than the Kama Sutra . “Now, Tory MPs are arguing among themselves about whether they are going to arrest parents, whether it will apply to Northern Ireland and how much it will cost. “It is a shambles, total chaos, and the country deserves so much better.” However, Tory deputy chairman Jonathan Gullis, responded: “Jonathan Ashworth tried desperately to criticise our national service announcement because he knows his party are on the back foot on big ideas. \"As always, Labour are all too happy to snipe from the sidelines, but still haven’t said whether they support or oppose our children getting more skills and better opportunities. Ashworth should speak to his own shadow foreign secretary who praised national service as a ‘worthwhile’ idea. “With no plan, Labour have to resort to dodgy criticism and analysis. No wonder they can’t cost their policies, meaning taxes would rise by £2,094 for every working household.”",

        "description": "This year’s hill where cheese rolling took place was especially slippery and muddy after recent rain.",
        "content": "Participants take part in the annual cheese rolling at Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, England, Monday, May 27, 2024. The traditional event attracts people from around the globe who come to chase a 7-pound Double Gloucester cheese down the steep Coopers Hill. Jacob King/PA via AP LONDON — Dairy-loving daredevils threw caution to the wind Monday for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. Cheered by several thousand spectators, scores of reckless racers chased 7-pound wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill, about 100 miles west of London, since at least 1826, and the sport of cheese-rolling is believed to be much older. The rough-and-tumble event often comes with safety concerns. Few competitors manage to stay on their feet all the way down the 200-yard hill. This year’s hill was especially slippery and muddy after recent rain. Members of a local rugby club lined up at the bottom to catch the tumbling competitors. Tom Kopke from Munich, Germany won one of the three men’s races. He said attitude was more important than technique. “You start and then the adrenaline takes over and you just go, go go,” Kopke said. “Look at this event, look at this hill,” added the muddy, breathless winner. “England is mad. I love it.” Local competitor Josh Shepherd and Dylan Twiss from Perth, Australia won the other two men’s downhill races. Abby Lampe from North Carolina triumphed in the women’s race with a lighting-fast roll that left the rest of the field far behind. “You just have to roll,” said Lampe, a graduate of NC State who also won in 2022. “There’s a little bit of pain, but it’s just going to be temporary.” Dozens of children and adults also competed in safer and slower, but no less grueling, uphill versions of the race, which are traditionally held on a late-May national holiday. About 20 miles (32 kilometers) away in the town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds over a 240-yard course up and down steep Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972, drawing on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town. Success. Please wait for the page to reload.

        "description": "“Mr Lamorde's demise comes at a time when the EFCC and Nigeria greatly needed his wealth of experience to tackle emerging law enforcement challenges,” Mr Olukoyede The post EFCC mourns Lamorde appeared first on Premium Times Nigeria.",
        "content": "The chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ola Olukoyede, has expressed sadness over the passing of one his predecessors, Ibrahim Lamorde, a retired deputy inspector general of police. In a statement by EFCC’s Head of Media and Publicity, Dele Oyewale, Mr Olukoyede said Mr Lamorde, who led the EFCC from 2012 to 2015, passed away at the age of 61 in Egypt on Saturday. “The loss of this distinguished law enforcement officer whose ideals and accomplishments we have long respected, is painful coming at a time the EFCC and indeed Nigeria still needed his wealth of experience to deal with emerging challenges in the law enforcement environment,” he said. He said Mr Lamorde made significant contributions to the EFCC and the Nigeria Police, where he spent his most productive years. “Mr Lamorde’s demise comes at a time when the EFCC and Nigeria greatly needed his wealth of experience to tackle emerging law enforcement challenges,” Mr Olukoyede noted. He said Mr Lamorde’s tenure at the EFCC included roles as director of operations, acting chairman, and substantive chairman. The statement explained that he was instrumental to establishing EFCC’s investigation machinery and mentoring the corps of officers who are now pivotal to the commission’s investigative activities.

He was also a reformist, and his legacy in the Commission includes the establishment of the Department of Internal Affairs, recently renamed the Department of Ethics and Integrity, and the Department of Public Affairs to drive the Commission’s corruption prevention mandate,” Mr Olukoyede stated. The EFCC chairman said Mr Lamorde renamed the EFCC’s Training and Research Institute in Karu to EFCC Academy, expanding its mandate to train all cadres of officers from the EFCC and other law enforcement agencies across Nigeria and Africa. He said the EFCC Academy has become a central hub for anti-corruption training in West Africa. The EFCC Chairman noted that Mr Lamorde’s lifetime of service as a police officer and statesman would remain a legacy of inspiration. “All of us in the EFCC feel deeply the loss of this soldier of anti-corruption. Our hearts are with his family and all those whose lives he impacted in his remarkable career. We share your bereavement in the loss of this icon. You can be assured that our thoughts and prayers are with you in your grief,” he stressed. The commission prays for the repose of Mr Lamorde’s soul and comfort for his family, the EFCC, and the entire nation. President Bola Tinubu, earlier on Sunday, expressed condolences to the family of Mr Lamorde. In addition to offering sympathies to the family, President Tinubu extended his condolences to the associates of the former anti-graft czar as well as to the EFCC, the Nigeria Police Force, and the government and people of Adamawa State. The President prayed for the repose ofthe soul of the deceased and comfort for his family during this difficult time. Mr Lamorde was born on 20 December 1962 in Mubi, Adamawa State.

        "description": "In response to an unprecedented surge in bear attacks, Japan is looking for ways for humans and animals to co-exist.",
        "content": "On 18 October 2023, in Kita-Akita, a regional city 700km north of Tokyo, local candy store owner Keiji Minatoya was starting his day when a young woman came running from his backyard screaming: \"There's a bear!\" \"I’d lived here for many decades but never seen a bear inside town,\" 66-year-old Minatoya thought and went back inside to continue working on making his butter mochi (a sweet treat). But when he finished work for the day and opened his garage door, he found himself face-to-face with an Asiatic black bear. Staring into the eyes of the 1.8m tall animal, Minatoya's survival instinct kicked in. He ran as fast as he could, but the bear caught up to him and pinned him to the ground before clawing at his face and body. \"I thought I was going to die,\" Minatoya recalled. \"The attack was vicious, so fast, so powerful — it was terrifying.\" Then suddenly the bear stopped its attack, and Minatoya was able to get into his house and call for help. On the same day, a record six people were attacked in Kita-Akita, sending shockwaves across the country. Most frightening of all was that these attacks were not isolated incidents. Source: SBS / Dateline Japan is experiencing an unprecedented surge in bear attacks, with the highest number reported in more than a century. Last year alone, 212 people were attacked by Japanese black or brown bears resulting in six deaths. The Akita prefecture has been particularly hard-hit, with 70 attacks recorded last year, more than anywhere else in the country. The alarming rate of attacks has authorities scrambling to find solutions to keep communities safe. Professor Koji Yamazaki from the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology is one of Japan’s leading experts on bears. His team has been tasked by the government with determining why there were so many attacks in 2023. He says unseasonably high temperatures in autumn last year caused a dramatic decrease in the harvest of the acorns and fruits that bears need to survive in winter. \"With bears, usually the most vital time of year is September. It is a very important period when they consume a lot of food to accumulate their body fat before hibernation,\" Yamazaki explained. Desperate and starving, bears travelled unusually close to towns and villages in search of food. \"If bears eat food scraps that are left near human dwellings, they come back.\" \"Bears also want an easy life like humans. Once they learn an easy way, they won’t give it up.\" Source: Getty / Petesphotography/iStockphoto Another factor contributing to the increasing encounters between bears and people is Japan’s population decline. The Japanese term 'satoyama' refers to areas between mountains and arable flatlands, traditionally used for rice cultivation and forestry. But as more people abandoned agricultural practices and moved away, it has become easier for bears to come closer to villages and towns. \"Mountainous regions, in particular, have seen progressive depopulation and aging population. As a result, bears have more space for their activities,\" Yamazaki said. As the borders between humans and bears blur, the Japanese government has responded by launching a nationwide bear safety program. From public safety videos teaching people how to survive bear attacks to utilising AI technology to monitor bears’ movement patterns, Japan has committed to a variety of measures to inform and keep citizens safe. However, one of the more controversial courses of action is the Japanese government’s new mass culling campaign. In April this year, black bears were placed on the animals designated for control list in the Akita prefecture, meaning hunters can kill bears without restriction and for a bounty. The government has also introduced subsidised ammunition and carcass removal for bear hunters. While the initiative has been welcomed in towns like Kita-Akita, where bear encounters have become particularly common, other communities are searching for solutions that embrace humans and the natural world living in harmony together. Source: SBS / Dateline In Karuizawa, a town 150km west of Tokyo, Picchio Wildlife Research Center has introduced an innovative bear dog program that allows bears and humans to coexist in their respective territories. First developed at the Wind Bear Institute in the United States, the bear dog program aims to make bears afraid of humans by tracking bear movements and when they get close to human dwellings use the dogs to chase the bear away by barking. \"Because humans and bears live so close, in order to coexist, we need to separate our respective territories,\" said dog handler Junpei Tanaka. Tanaka works with Tama, his Karelian Bear Dog, a breed native to Finland known for its ability to hunt brown bears. \"With the help of dogs, we teach bears that humans are dangerous so that the bears that live here stay away from humans.\" Source: SBS / Dateline Since the program’s launch in 2004, it has reported an extraordinary reduction in the damages and incidents involving bears. There have been no bear attacks in town for over a decade, according to Amelia Hiorns, a researcher from Picchio. \"Our management system involves a variety of mitigation techniques. So, the bear dogs, electric fences, bear-proof bins and a community engagement program so that people can understand how to kind of interact and coexist with nature as well,\" Hiorns said. \"We have to accept the bears as much as we can. And obviously [bears] have to accept humans to an extent as well. \"Then I think it is possible to coexist. It's not necessarily going to ever be like perfect harmony, more of a compromise. And that's probably the best way we can do it,\" she said. Share facebook twitter instagram youtube Dateline is an Australian award-winning international documentary series.

        "description": "Landscape photographer Dani Watson realised she was creating a roadmap to dangerous locations for tourists and influencers, who she saw do \"horrific\" things for the sake of a selfie.",
        "content": "Landscape photographer Dani Watson loved posting photos of stunning, remote and unusual locations. Then she realised she was fuelling a dangerous selfie-taking culture. Within hours of posting an image on social media, she would receive a flood of messages from followers. \"They’d ask: 'where did you take it?' 'How did you get there?' 'Can you pinpoint it on Google Maps?'\" she told Insight. \"I realised I was sort of creating a roadmap for tourists and influencers.\" While she may have taken the photo with a drone, having got all the right permissions, the average person trying to replicate such a picture could be putting their lives in danger, she said. \"Photographers like me were taking photos and geotagging and hashtag tagging them, which was creating a wave of popularity in certain locations with tourists or others who wanted to go and capture those images. \"I was part of the problem.\" Monique Sherar knows all too well the perils of accessing dangerous places to take a photo. One beautiful day after lots of rain she was at Empress Falls in the NSW Blue Mountains. She wanted to capture the view but didn't plan to take a selfie. In the end she fell before she even had the chance to take a photo. \"One minute I was walking on the track and the next minute I was tumbling through the air,\" she told Insight. \"I just remember hitting the ground and having this full-body burning sensation. Just like a pain that I never felt before.\" After an eight to 10-metre fall, Monique landed in water at the base of a waterfall. \"It was this compounding pain, water, cold, fear and just anxiety of this overwhelming thing that had happened in a split second.\" Monique had friends with her who were able to get help quickly. While she miraculously avoided any internal bleeding or head injuries, she sustained multiple fractures. She had to have a hip replacement and now has only 50 per cent movement and strength in her left arm. Source: Supplied She says she's become more cautious since the accident. \"I think that I'll always still want to get those photos and get that nice view but now I have a calculated approach to adventure. That thrill-seeking nature of me has left.\" Sergeant Dallas Atkinson, who leads the Police Rescue team in the Blue Mountains, says he's noticed an increase in the volume of people getting out in nature. “I guess it’s a by-product of COVID and being locked away for so long. People are pushing the boundaries a bit more and going into remote locations, without the full appreciation of the dangers,\" he told Insight. Atkinson says the internet and social media now make it easy for people to get directions, though many are ill-prepared for what they may find. “Unfortunately, some people who are going down that path don’t have adequate experience or knowledge ... Nature is also unpredictable so if things go pear-shaped people can be stuck in the middle of nowhere without a lifeline, waiting and hoping to be rescued.\" Source: Supplied / Dani Watson Last year, Samuel Cornell from the University of NSW published the first Australian study of selfie-related deaths, with 379 recorded between 2008 and 2021. \"There's a strong allure on social media for people to get content ... and there's an intrinsic reward for doing so,\" he said. \"Many of these places are in beautiful locations, but also quite hazardous locations. They're hard to rescue people from.\" Cornell believes taking selfies in dangerous places isn't just foolish, it's a public health hazard in the same category as smoking or road traffic accidents and needs to be taken seriously. He has researched the effectiveness of using location-based social media safety messaging to reduce injuries and fatalities at certain locations, and suggests social media influencers could also be useful in sharing the risks. \"We might need to look at using social media influencers to convey safety messages on TikTok and other platforms,\" he said. Photographer Dani's realisation that she was part of the problem led her to start a research project at Melbourne's RMIT University called InstaFame. In it, she documented the risks photographers and tourists were taking in the quest for the perfect pic. As part of her project, she was photographed in dangerous locations, including at the Grampians National Park in Victoria. “Even though weather conditions were perfect, there was no wind and I had a rope nearby ... I remember saying to the friend who was with me that I don’t think I’ve ever felt so uneasy about something. There was nothing under me. I don’t think that enters some people's minds.\" Dani also recognised the toll that so-called selfie tourism was taking on nature. “When I re-visited a location at Trentham Falls in Victoria where I’d taken photographs two years earlier, it was evident the entire spot was decimated. All the lush ferns were gone and walking paths had been carved through the landscape.\" Source: AAP / PR IMAGE But one of the more \"horrific\" things Dani witnessed was at the Sea Cliff Bridge, a popular tourist attraction in the NSW Illawarra region that has become a notoriously dangerous selfie spot and the scene of numerous rescues over the years. \"This guy had rented a minibus and was doing selfie tours. He just parked at the bottom of Sea Cliff Bridge, pointed the way up, and these tourists with no knowledge of the area walked up this goat track to take selfies. \"They walked back down the same way, slipping and sliding, some were only wearing thongs or barefoot. It seemed to me that the tourist operator was profiting from this selfie culture”. A group of photographers took Dani up the same way through the steep cliffs. \"Once I got to the top I was like, 'why?' It’s a great view, but why would you take that risk?\" 22/02/2024 01:00 Share facebook twitter instagram youtube Insight is Australia's leading forum for debate and powerful first-person stories offering a unique perspective on the way we live. facebook twitter instagram youtube 6 min read",

        "content": "viewers were left on the and Rose Jackson's (Christine Tremarco) secret alliance was unveiled in Monday's dramatic episode. The plot thickened when it was revealed that Ruby had been financially supporting Rose to orchestrate Kim Tate's (Claire King) downfall, but questions arose about the true nature of their 'friendship'. In a clandestine meeting away from prying eyes at the pub, Ruby confessed: \"I paid a small fortune to get those debt collectors off your back,\" to which a thankful Rose responded: \"I know and I'm very grateful.\" Ruby didn't mince her words as she cautioned Rose: \"I'm not made of money. If you renege on that bill, I lose a lot of money. So where are you gonna get the money from?” Rose, undeterred by Ruby's intimidation, retorted: \"You don't scare me. It's not as easy as I thought it would be. I'm not like you. I don't want to hurt people - my family. Since I realised that if I break Kim and Will up, I end up hurting Dawn.\" Their scheme against Kim was evident as Ruby laid out the plan: \"If you go through with the plan, you'll still get Dawn in your life. Sure she'll be a bit upset that Kim and Will have split but you'll be the one who will be mopping up her tears.\" Concerned about her sick child, Rose expressed: \"Evan is still poorly. Can't we wait til he's better and things are more settled?\" But Ruby, focused on the endgame, replied: \"You get your family back and a debt free life - and I get to ruin Kim and make my family happy. It's win-win.\" Could there be more to the friendship between two characters - might they be related? The soap has hinted at a possible DNA surprise that could reveal the pair as sisters. When Rose first strutted into the village, it was clear she had a connection with Will. The plot thickened when it turned out she's Dawn's mum. : \"I am thrilled to be joining ! To be working with such a wonderful cast and crew along with the brilliant writing and production team is an absolute joy! Rose is so much fun to play. She is free spirited, boisterous and totally mischievous with a steely edge and a big heart.\" Adding to the intrigue, producer Laura Shaw said: \"We are massively delighted to welcome Christine Tremarco to the Emmerdale Family. Christine brings a wealth of experience and talent and playing the character of Rose, a true free spirit with an exuberant outlook on life, she certainly promises to cause a real storm for some of our villagers.\"",

        "description": "A University of Calgary professor has developed an AI tool that helps educators design curriculum.The post How AI can be used to create post-secondary curriculum appeared first on rabble.ca.",
        "content": "Concerns about the negative impact of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) on post-secondary learning continues to drive vital discussions. University of Calgary professor Soroush Sabbaghen is encouraging his peers to look past the stigma and embrace GenAI as a highly customizable tool that can be harnessed to improve student success. Sabbaghen developed a tool called SMARTIE — a Strategic Module Assistant for Rubrics, Tasks and Inclusive Education. This first-of-its-kind suite of web-based applications works like an intelligent assistant, enabling educators to design inclusive course components and by extension, create learning environments that are accessible and adaptable for all students. “There are a lot of faculty who dislike GenAI, but it’s actually a tool that enables us to set students up for success in unprecedented ways,” said Sabbaghan, who is also director of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) at the Werklund School of Education. Sabbaghan, who embraced the power of the GPT-4 application programming interface to build SMARTIE, thinks of GPT-4 as the enhanced next level of ChatGPT . Sabbaghan will share the impact of SMARTIE at the upcoming Congress of the Humanities and Social Science s (Congress 2024), Canada’s largest academic gathering and one of the most comprehensive in the world, taking place June 12 to 21 at McGill University in Montreal. Integrating EDI principles into current teaching practices creates an enormous cognitive burden and is extremely time-consuming for teachers. SMARTIE streamlines the process by providing recommendations along with tailored support in a matter of seconds. Since making the tool freely available online, Sabbaghan has recorded more than 5,000 hits. Sabbaghan in consultation with faculty, then tested and refined SMARTIE to remove variability and improve accuracy. The program currently supports multilingual students as well as students with dyslexia and visual or auditory impairment. There are also plans to support neurodiversity. Sabbaghan will demonstrate how different faculties are using the technology to achieve game-changing results like professors in the University of Calgary’s Faculty of Engineering using SMARTIE to measure the diversity of their reading lists to ensure marginalized groups are represented and that faculty are meeting their goals for theoretical, multidisciplinary and temporal diversity. Meanwhile, members of the Faculty of Social Work are finding SMARTIE useful for personalizing tasks, developing fair assessment strategies and ensuring experiential learning activities are equitable. To date, Sabbaghan has released seven apps aimed at assisting with course structure, learning activities and rubric design. Unlike other GenAI tools that search the web broadly, SMARTIE is linked to trusted inclusivity sources only and apps are rigorously vetted before being released. “This is about moving in the direction of creating courses that allow everyone to succeed, regardless of their background, personality or ability,” said Sabbaghan. Plans are underway to develop a version of the tool suitable for kindergarten to grade 12 learning environments as well. “The idea is to help you think, not to copy and paste. We don’t want teachers to rely on AI. We want it to give them recommendations so they can make their own judgements and decisions,” he said. Another AI marketexpanding exponentially is healthcare with the global market forecast to reach $88 billion US by 2028. Yet, without input from the people using these technologies, designers may engineer systemic biases and harmful stereotypical assumptions into these apps. A first-of-its-kind study, Towards an Accessible and Inclusive A.I. (AI2), is calling for a paradigm shift in the way AI developers approach solutions for people with disabilities. The leads on the study include Christo El Morr, York University Professor of Information Technology; Rachel Gorman , York University Associate Professor of Critical Disability Studies; and University of Calgary Associate Professor, Faculty of Social Work, Yahya El-Lahib , AI2 research assistant, Bushra Kundi , will be sharing the teams’ findings as a featured speaker at Congress 2024. Kundi is a research assistant at York University; Master of Science student in e-Health at McMaster University; and a Senior Clinical Applications Specialist at Oakville-based Nucleus Independent Living . “The problem with current health AI tools aimed at assisting people with disabilities is that they only focus on the medical model, which sees disability as a problem and looks at helping someone overcome their limitations,” said Kundi. AI2s research found a need for a more inclusive approach to achieve accessible and inclusive AI. To achieve that goal means looking at the social model of disability, including environmental changes that can be implemented to meet needs, and that requires a more ‘disability-centric’ AI design process with input from multi-disciplinary teams as well as people living with disabilities. “If we don’t shift to a more inclusive and collaborative methodology, we run the risk of producing solutions that actually perpetuate societal biases against people with disabilities,” Kundi explained. At Congress 2024, Kundi will highlight how AI is currently being applied to help people with disabilities. Kundi’s work revealed that despite AI’s potential to support self-management of health conditions, enhance assistive devices and further disability justice, models developed to date have not sufficiently measured or addressed bias. “Essentially, an ableist perspective prevails within AI, potentially exacerbating disparities rather than alleviating them,” said Kundi. That’s because historical data used to train AI systems can be inherently prejudiced against people with disabilities and is often based on beliefs that typical abilities are superior. Even generative AI tools like ChatGPT, which are rapidly opening up opportunities to help people with speech or hearing disabilities, could have biases. “We need to ensure that we’re considering people with disabilities and the social model of disability so that we design inclusive AI solutions. Software engineers are skilled in creating AI models, but without that support and insight from the person living with the disability, they will never be able to cover all of the bases required to make their model disability-centric,” said Kundi. Based on their findings, the researchers are calling for a collaborative effort to reorient AI development towards a disability-focused framework and are urging developers to include the user perspective when creating data sets and AI models. “If we want to ensure equitable benefits of AI advancements for all members of society, it is imperative that AI systems advance beyond technical excellence to encompass social responsibility and inclusivity as well.” At Sustaining shared futures — The Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences Congress 2024 — thousands of research papers will be unveiled and presentations made by social sciences and humanities experts from around the globe. More than 8,000 scholars, graduate students and practitioners are expected to participate in the ten-day event focusing on generating solutions for today while creating the sustainable systems of tomorrow and ensuring the inclusion of inspiring ideas, dialogue and action that create a more diverse, sustainable, democratic and just society. Organized by the Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences in partnership with McGill University, Congress 2024 is sponsored by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, Universities Canada, the Canada Foundation for Innovation, University Affairs, Sage, and The Conversation Canada.

        "content": "Around 30 British parliamentarians and Lords sent a letter this Friday to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, David Cameron, in which they call, in a bipartisan approach, on the British executive to support ”officially and without delay” the plan of Moroccan autonomy as the ”only solution” to the artificial conflict around the Moroccan Sahara. In addition to being the “most pragmatic” path, the autonomy initiative proposed by Morocco for the Sahara, which “respects local traditions and democratic aspirations, offers a viable solution to achieve peace and lasting stability,” underlined the deputies and members of the House of Lords. While recalling that the initiative is “widely supported” by London’s allies and more than 80 countries around the world, the signatories specified that the rallying around this plan, which constitutes “the only realistic solution”, testifies to the desire of international partners to promote regional stability and prosperity, “thus reinforcing the central role of the autonomy initiative in advancing peace efforts”. “There must be no room for more separatism or division,” they insisted, assuring that on the contrary, Morocco’s “proactive commitment to promoting regional security and stability must be reinforced”. “Remaining neutral or attempting alternative resolutions can only perpetuate a harmful status quo that endangers the security of the region,” they argued. While several of them visited Morocco and its Southern Provinces, where they had the opportunity to meet local leaders, representatives of civil society and human rights organizations, the signatories said their observations, coupled with those of respected academics such as Professor Marc Weller, Chair of International Law and International Constitutional Studies at the University of Cambridge, reinforce their “belief that the UK must provide proactive support to Morocco’s autonomy plan. Additionally, the Sahara region has the potential to significantly improve energy opportunities, secure supply chains, and enable access to new markets, they wrote, citing strategic infrastructure, for example of the “impressive” port of Dakhla, as proof of sustainable progress, allowing the region to establish itself as a pole of innovation and international cooperation. To fully realize this potential, “London must provide support from its financial institutions, such as UK export finance (UKEF) and British international investment (BII)”, they continued, recalling that this approach, adopted in particular by the United States and France, is compatible with the association agreement concluded between the two countries (UK and Morocco), which covers the Moroccan Sahara region and which was deemed legal by the High Court in London. The MPs added that the United Kingdom must strengthen its alliances with stable, like-minded nations “in order to promote regional stability and international security”, ensuring that among these partner nations, Morocco “occupies a preponderant place”. “It is a leading strategic ally in North Africa, which shares crucial values and perspectives for our two countries,” they continued. The forthcoming strategic dialogue between the UK and Morocco represents a unique opportunity for the UK to redefine its role and influence in the region, the signatories noted, assuring us that “Morocco deserves our full and unequivocal support”.",

        "description": "\"I believe marijuana has helped me in so many regards, with my anxiety,\" the country crooner added.",
        "content": "Country star Jelly Roll has credited marijuana with keeping him away from hard drugs. “I think a world without weed, Jelly Roll’s drinking codeine and popping Xanax and snorting cocaine again, but a world with weed, I’ll be alright,” he told Taste of Country in an interview published Friday. “I get in trouble for this, all the time, but my stance on marijuana will always be the same: I believe marijuana has helped me in so many regards, with my anxiety,” he added. “This is a hot button topic, but, truly, marijuana has kept me sober.” Jelly Roll, born Jason DeFord, has been open about his past struggles with addiction and substance abuse. He even landed himself in the slammer at 23 years old for drug dealing, according to his June 2023 interview with Billboard . While the 39-year-old “Wild Ones” hitmaker isn’t fully sober, he is passionate about helping people stay away from dangerous drugs. In January, he addressed the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and urged legislators to take action against the supply and distribution of fentanyl in the U.S. “At every concert I perform, I witness the heartbreaking impact of fentanyl,” he candidly explained. “I see fans grappling with this tragedy in the form of music ... that they seek solace in music and hope that their experiences won’t befall others.” “I’m not here to defend the use of illegal drugs, and I also understand the paradox of my history as a drug dealer standing in front of this committee,” he went on. “But equally, I think that’s what makes me perfect to talk about this. I was a part of the problem. I am here now standing as a man that wants to be a part of the solution.” Last December, Jelly Roll told People that it was of utmost importance to him to use his platform for good and give people who are struggling with drug abuse a chance at living a fulfilling life.

Hooked on Housewives? “I always said that if I ever got in this situation, I would do everything I could to give back,” he explained. “The fact that just me showing up places can make people happy is such a gift, and I feel like if God gave me that gift, I should show up.” Jelly Roll — who recently admitted he hates most of his tattoos — was incarcerated several times for drug-related charges before he became a successful ACM-winning artist. His troubles with the law even lost him the privilege to vote. However, he earned his GED while locked up at the age of 23 and has worked to make his life meaningful and full. In addition to crediting weed with helping him stay sober from hard drugs, he has also praised his wife of eight years , Bunnie XO, for helping him stay on a positive path and be able to raise his daughter, Bailee, and son, Noah. “You’re talking about a woman that came in and took a child that was soon to be born and a child that [we were] soon to have full custody of,” he raved to Billboard. “I would have never got custody of my daughter without her. I wouldn’t have had the stability or the money.” Bunnie XO, 44, has also been by Jelly Roll’s side as he focuses on his physical health. In 2018, he revealed he lost about 200 pounds after tipping the scale at over 500. Last month, she revealed he quit social media after repeated negative comments about his size “hurt him.” “Don’t bully people, because you never know where they are mentally,” she pleaded. “There are a lot of people who are not as strong as me, that are on the internet, and they don’t deserve to f—kin’ be bullied.”",

        "content": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that there are similarities in the works of great poet ONV Kurup and Odia novelist Pratibha Ray. He was inaugurating the award presentation ceremony of ONV Sahitya Award organized by ONV Cultural Academy on the occasion of ONV's 93rd birthday. \"Both of them who won the Jnanpith Award have depicted the miseries of women and stood for their upliftment. Both spoke for the environment as well. I am proud to present the award named after ONV, a staunch advocate of the progressive movement, to a writer who has brought her mother tongue Odia to the world,\" said the Chief Minister. Adoor Gopalakrishnan, film director and president of the academy, presided over the function. Pratibha Ray was awarded the Literary Award by the Chief Minister for her original contribution to the field of literature. The award consists of three lakh rupees, a sculpture and a citation. Durga Prasad received the Yuva Sahitya Award, which includes Rs 50,000, a sculpture and a citation. Poet Prabhavarma read the citation.

He came to honour me at a function in the past. He came as a sign of respect for me despite having many physical disabilities. From there he went straight to the hospital. A writer has no free language, love is his language,\" said Pratibha Ray.",

        "content": "HOUSTON (AP) — When Jose Trevino took a teen leadership class taught by Sherri Davis in high school the New York Yankees catcher couldn’t have imagined the long-lasting impact it would have. “It changed my life,” Trevino told The Associated Press. “She taught me a ton of lessons in high school, life lessons that help to this day.” So, when Davis retired after a 47-year teaching career and started a nonprofit in his hometown of Corpus Christi, Texas, called “ Special Hearts in the Arts ” in 2016 to provide arts education to those with special needs, Trevino quickly became one of the organization’s most important benefactors. This week he’ll give the beloved group another gift to continue its work. Trevino has been selected as the first Most Valuable Philanthropist of the year by the MLBPA Players Trust and is receiving a $5,000 grant for Special Hearts. Trevino was selected for the award over more than a dozen other applicants by a panel of four former players. Amy Hever, the director of the Players Trust, said its focus is to help players create more impact for causes in their communities. “So, this is a way to not only recognize them, but it also raises tremendous awareness for these causes, especially these hyper-local causes and organizations that some would argue are doing the greatest work in their local communities,” Hever said. Davis raved about Trevino’s generosity and the special bond he’s built with the group. Trevino often visits Special Hearts in the offseason and the students rave about meeting him and covet the pictures he’s taken with them. “You’ll never have anyone say anything bad about Jose,” Davis said. “I think he just makes people feel worthy of whatever they do. That’s a Jose thing that he does.” At Special Hearts, students, who range in age from 12-80, take classes in a variety of the arts including dance, theater, music and art. The group performs around the city and has become a favorite of Corpus Christi mayor Paulette M. Guajardo, who invites them to participate in the Fourth of July celebration each year. On Saturday morning, about three dozen Special Hearts performed a sign language version of the song “Love Can Build A Bridge.” Students beamed as they did the number, which they’ve adopted as their theme song. Arts are the focus of the center, but perhaps more important is the confidence participation builds and the community that is forged through the classes. “We don’t say special needs in here,” Davis said. “We say Special Hearts. We never say disabilities. We always say special abilities.” Before each of their performances Davis leads the group in a back-and-forth affirmation. “I always ask them: ‘Who are you?’ And they say: ‘Special Hearts.’ And I say: ‘What do you have? Special abilities?’” Victoria Hinojosa has been a Special Heart for about three years and is the center of the group’s ballet folklorico performances, plays the guitar and takes art classes. When she first joined the group, she told Davis she couldn’t dance because she’s in a wheelchair. “I said: ‘don’t say, I can’t do, say do what you can, how you can,’” Davis said. “And boy, can she swing that skirt.” Hinojosa, who recently began volunteering to help others at the center, can’t overstate the importance of Special Hearts in her life. “I don’t know where I would have been if it wasn’t for Special Hearts,” she said. “It has really made me feel confident in what I do and how I look at things and I love the way I draw now, and it inspires me to do more.” Though he’s often almost 2,000 miles away in New York City, Trevino’s presence is a huge part of Special Hearts. A big photo of him hangs in Davis’ office and posters featuring pictures of him and the students adorn the center. Davis sends him videos of their performances and she recently sent a picture of the group holding a Yankees banner they made with his name on it. “It’s amazing what he’s doing for Special Hearts,” Hinojosa said. “He has really made us all happy, made us really look at ourselves and think we can do whatever we want. We can go out there and perform... and show people what we can do.” Though Davis and the students credit Trevino for his support, he’s quick to point out that the most special heart in the organization is the one belonging to his former teacher. “That’s what it is, it’s her heart,” Trevino said. “Her heart — it’s ginormous. She has a big heart and she’s always looking out for other people.” Idali Duarte Montes, another former student of Davis who now works with her at Special Hearts, agreed. “Without Sherri, of course, this wouldn’t even be here,” she said. “It came completely from her 100%. And all her hard work was what started it. And then everybody, all the love that she exudes and gets from others that want to support and help has brought all that to Special Hearts in the Arts.” Wiliam Rucizka, is another student who is known around Corpus Christi as “Will The Thrill” for his ability to hype up the crowds before performances. Constantly smiling and upbeat, Rucizka enjoys a variety of activities at the center. “We do art, music, theater, dance and ... we do ‘Love Can Build a Bridge’ every day,” he said. “We do celebrating every day.” And because of Trevino’s recent gift, Special Hearts will add a new program. Called “The Remarkables,” the group will dress as superheroes, each with their own special power, and perform at children’s hospitals and nursing homes. Though he’s been out of high school for more than a decade, Trevino still leans on things Davis taught him. An important one is a breathing technique that the Gold and Platinum Glove winner uses to slow things down and “really be in the moment” before games. “It’s really cool what Ms. Davis is doing, and I have a lot of respect for her, and I appreciate everything she’s doing,” Trevino said. “I think anybody who’s around Ms. Davis is lucky because she’s just a great person.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB Close Modal Suggest a Correction Your name (required) Your email (required) Report a typo or grammatical error (required) Submit Δ Suggest a Correction",

Sailing from its homeport of Long Beach in Southern California, the cruise ship responded to a call from the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Saturday about a small boat full of people who were stranded at sea in the area. According to the cruise line, was sailing toward Ensenada, Mexico, Saturday afternoon when they got the call from the Coast Guard. Carnival said the ship was then routed to the location provided and they were able to rescue all 25 people, including three children, who were stranded on a small boat. The Coast Guard said it also launched a small boat and helicopter to assist.

While conducting an investigation, detectives “learned that during the course of 9-10 years, dozens of citizens were being victimized by a serial slingshot shooter,” the Asuza Police Department said in a statement. The man is suspected of breaking windows and car windshields and of narrowly missing people with ball bearings shot from a slingshot, the statement said. No injuries were reported. The man was arrested Thursday after officers served a search warrant and found a slingshot and ball bearings at his home in Asuza, about 25 miles (40 km) east of Los Angeles, police said. Azusa police Lt. Jake Bushey said Saturday that detectives learned that most of the ball bearings were shot from the suspect’s backyard. “We’re not aware of any kind of motive other than just malicious mischief,” Bushey told the Southern California News Group.

Speaking after she inspected the worksites, Dr Noura Al-Mashaan, also Minister of Municipality, said 92.2 percent of the project has been executed, affirming that the venture is in line with the state’s approach to provide citizens with top-notch public services. “This is a bright stage in our efforts to attain the objective of providing an excellent infrastructure,” said Mashaan, referring to the Cairo Street project that covers the construction of three tunnels and six causeways. It also includes building seven pedestrian bridges, water and rain networks, phone communications, lighting, traffic signs and urban greenery. Mashaan, who also examined works for developing the Second and Third Ring Roads, said that up to 97 percent of the renovation works have been accomplished in these locations. She also praised efforts exerted by the personnel of the Public Authority for Roads and Transportation. Cairo Street links several residential districts and regions. Kuwait’s domestic transport network is distinguished, with up to seven ring roads accessible to all residential districts and workplaces. — KUNA",

Physicians, healthcare workers and volunteers will be stationed throughout the event to assist cancer survivors and their caregivers. For information, call 217-876-4749.",

        "content": "The 2 Johnnies have said the reason behind their shock 2FM exit is probably not as juicy as people want it to be and they just want lives back. The lads were working seven days a week and their hit podcast earns more money and has more listeners than their radio show, according to Johnny B, one half of the iconic duo. The Tipperary natives will release their debut album this Friday ahead of a summer of gig across Ireland, Australia and America. Read more: The 2 Johnnies open up about their 2fm show being taken off air for misogynistic comments Read more: Johnny Smacks lifts lid on relationship with wife Annie and their Christmas wedding Johnny B told RSVP Live: \"The reason is probably not as juicy as people want it to be. We’re working seven days a week and our podcast earns more money and has more listeners than radio. \"We’re putting a lot of energy into our Patreon podcast, which has become very special. That’s another community and a lot of people don’t understand what’s going on there and how important it is to us. \"As much as we love radio, it’s not the biggest thing in our world. It’s not the second biggest thing in our world either! \"As much as we loved the team and our listeners, we can’t keep working seven days a week. I want my life back.\" It has been speculated that The 2 Johnnies left 2FM because of the new register of interests and because they would have to declare their outside earnings. Johnny said: \"Not really. That’s still all a bit unclear in terms of what people will have to declare. \"I’m not sure what way that’s going to play out. That’s not a main concern for us.\" Would they have stayed on 2FM for more money? Johnny said: \"No, money was never an issue.\" Two weeks after announcing their surprise exit, Johnny B and Johnny Smacks will front their afternoon radio show for the final time. The same day their album is released. He said: \"It will be emotional, it will be sad. We have come to love our team; Aifric, Aindriu, Caroline and Anita have been so supportive. \"Working with us has probably been different to working with other DJs because we have so much going on. They’ve been brilliant and they’ve adapted with us. \"We love our listeners and we really feel like we’ve created a bit of a community. \"There is a big crossover between our radio show and the podcast and the journey lives on in a different form. It’s been a brilliant two and a half years.\" The 2 Johnnies' often talked about, long-promised and much sweated-over debut album \"Small Town Heroes\" is released on 31st May 2024. Johnny said: \"We’re finally releasing our debut album. We’ve been going since 2016 and music is what really got us going. \"Younger people really took to them and they’ve taken on a life of their own. The songs on this album are an extension of the podcast, it’s about riding, shifting, drinking, fighting, farming, living in a small town, acting the maggot and driving around in a lowered Honda Civic.\" Johnny wants the album to be a summer hit. He said: \"You don’t know how an album is going to be received, we hope that it will become the soundtrack to people’s summers.\" Their album will be followed by a summer of big gigs in Dublin , Galway and Limerick as well as Australia and America . Their unique festival Pints in a Field will have Craig David and Five as special guests. Johnny said: \"We love doing Pints in a Field and who would have thought we’d have Craig David and Five playing with us. The acts we book for the festival are based on the podcast. \"We had Basshunter last year because we had so many stories about him sent in to us. Whoever people are talking about over the next few months, that’s who will be playing with us next year.\" The album will be available to stream and to buy from Irish retailers on Vinyl and CD from 31st May. To celebrate the release the lads will be hitting the road to meet the fans and will be signing copies of their album in record stores around the country. Anyone who pre-ordered the album will also have access to a free gig.",

        "description": "O'Hoppe, 24, has still caught just 98 games in the majors. Refusing to use his inexperience as an excuse, O'Hoppe said he hasn't lived up to his own expectations in terms of helping the pitching staff.",
        "content": "ANAHEIM — A month ago the Angels were swept by the Minnesota Twins , allowing 11 runs in the series finale. It was one of the lowest points of a mostly disappointing two months. For more than a half hour after that Sunday afternoon game, catcher Logan O’Hoppe sat in the Angels dugout conferring with bench coach Ray Montgomery. O’Hoppe then spoke to reporters and took responsibility for the flood of runs and hits they allowed. “When there’s a crooked number under hits on the scoreboard, it’s not fun and you do feel guilty about it,” O’Hoppe said that day. “You do a lot of work to make sure that doesn’t happen. It’s part of my job. That’s why I’m here, to win games and get these guys through it, and I’m not happy with how I’ve been doing it.” Since that day, the Angels pitching has shown a few more encouraging signs, although the results still aren’t what the Angels need them to be. The same can be said for O’Hoppe’s role in the process. “I’m not gonna sit there and tell you that I feel like I’m doing more good than bad right now,” the 24-year-old catcher said this weekend. “I feel like I’m definitely feeling the inexperience and opportunities to grow more than I am confirming the things that work. It’s just something I’m trying to be patient with. I’m not gonna lie. It’s taken a toll on me mentally.” Any discussion of O’Hoppe’s role the performance of the Angels pitchers requires some nuance. First, no one would suggest that the primary responsibility for pitching strategy falls on anyone but the pitcher who has the ball in his hand. Also, no one who has spent any time around O’Hoppe has any doubt in the work he puts in toward learning his pitchers and devising a game plan. In fact, one of the reasons the pitchers like O’Hoppe so much is because they feel how invested he is in their performance. That said, O’Hoppe acknowledges that he hasn’t lived up to his own expectations in terms of handling the pitching staff. “I think it’s all a learning process,” O’Hoppe said. “I know this position carries a lot of weight and a lot of responsibility, and that’s the part I really do love. It’s heavier than I expected. I’m sure some of that is self-inflicted. It’s just it’s not fun looking up and seeing crooked numbers on the board. Then you have a start like (José) Soriano’s in Cleveland and it all balances out. I know I’m inexperienced. I know I have a lot to learn, but at the same time, I’m trying to stick to what I know works personally and work with them.” O’Hoppe was behind the plate when Soriano threw six scoreless innings on May 3 at Cleveland, just a few days after that nightmare against the Twins. He was the catcher for all three of the Angels shutouts, including the Soriano start in Cleveland, a Reid Detmers start on April 12 in Boston and a Patrick Sandoval start on May 7 in Pittsburgh. Left-hander Tyler Anderson, who has been the Angels most consistent starter all season, said last week in an interview on MLB Network Radio that O’Hoppe has improved. “From where he was last year to this year, he’s made massive strides on the catching side,” Anderson said. Still, the Angels have a 4.64 ERA, which ranks 27th in the majors. According to some in and around the clubhouse, there have been times when pitch selection has been an issue, as well as execution. Since the establishment of the pitch timer last year, it’s more difficult than ever for pitchers to shake off a sign until they get what they want. Mound visits are now limited to four per game, further impacting the ability of a pitcher and catcher to get on the same page when there are disagreements. Back in 2022, the Angels ranked ninth in the majors in ERA. Most of the pitch calling that season was handled by veteran catchers Max Stassi and Kurt Suzuki. Stassi’s unplanned absence last year left O’Hoppe as the No. 1 catcher, and then he missed four months of the season rehabbing from shoulder surgery. O’Hoppe said he felt like he was trying to take in so much information in such a short time that it was like “drinking out of a fire hose.” Over the winter the Angels’ front office decided not to provide O’Hoppe with a veteran mentor. Catchers Austin Hedges and Martin Maldonado, for example, were both available as free agents. Instead, the Angels are trying to speed up the learning curve by giving O’Hoppe every inning he can handle. He’s started 41 of the Angels’ 53 games. His 369-1/3 innings behind the plate are tied for the fourth most in the majors. Even with a heavy workload this season, O’Hoppe has caught just 98 games in the majors, which is not even one full season for a No. 1 catcher. O’Hoppe acknowledges that he’s still learning, although grudgingly. “I pride of myself for not making excuses,” he said. “Because I’m here; I need to win games and be the best I can be. I do tell myself that (I’m inexperienced) but I don’t think that’s any reason to justify any poor performance or excuse.” Instead of shrugging off the disappointment and chalking it up to growing pains, O’Hoppe said he brings the games home with him. He analyzes the games long after they’re over to see what he could have done differently. “It’s tough to wind down some nights,” O’Hoppe said, “but I know it’s part of it.” O’Hoppe is also going through all of this with a new staff around him. Pitching coach Barry Enright and bullpen coach Steve Karsay, as well as run prevention coordinator Alex Cultice, are all new to the mix of voices in O’Hoppe’s head as he decides which pitches to call more than 120 times a night. Without a veteran catcher to help, O’Hoppe said he’s frequently communicated with Suzuki — now a member of the Angels’ front office — as well as catching coach Jerry Narron and backup catcher Matt Thaiss. Manager Ron Washington neither blamed nor absolved O’Hoppe for the performance of the pitching staff. It is a simple fact that the catcher and pitcher work together, and in this case there’s plenty of inexperience on both sides.

        "description": "O'Hoppe, 24, has still caught just 98 games in the majors. Refusing to use his inexperience as an excuse, O'Hoppe said he hasn't lived up to his own expectations in terms of helping the pitching staff.",
        "content": "ANAHEIM — A month ago the Angels were swept by the Minnesota Twins , allowing 11 runs in the series finale. It was one of the lowest points of a mostly disappointing two months. For more than a half hour after that Sunday afternoon game, catcher Logan O’Hoppe sat in the Angels dugout conferring with bench coach Ray Montgomery. O’Hoppe then spoke to reporters and took responsibility for the flood of runs and hits they allowed. “When there’s a crooked number under hits on the scoreboard, it’s not fun and you do feel guilty about it,” O’Hoppe said that day. “You do a lot of work to make sure that doesn’t happen. It’s part of my job. That’s why I’m here, to win games and get these guys through it, and I’m not happy with how I’ve been doing it.” Since that day, the Angels pitching has shown a few more encouraging signs, although the results still aren’t what the Angels need them to be. The same can be said for O’Hoppe’s role in the process. “I’m not gonna sit there and tell you that I feel like I’m doing more good than bad right now,” the 24-year-old catcher said this weekend. “I feel like I’m definitely feeling the inexperience and opportunities to grow more than I am confirming the things that work. It’s just something I’m trying to be patient with. I’m not gonna lie. It’s taken a toll on me mentally.” Any discussion of O’Hoppe’s role the performance of the Angels pitchers requires some nuance. First, no one would suggest that the primary responsibility for pitching strategy falls on anyone but the pitcher who has the ball in his hand. Also, no one who has spent any time around O’Hoppe has any doubt in the work he puts in toward learning his pitchers and devising a game plan. In fact, one of the reasons the pitchers like O’Hoppe so much is because they feel how invested he is in their performance. That said, O’Hoppe acknowledges that he hasn’t lived up to his own expectations in terms of handling the pitching staff. “I think it’s all a learning process,” O’Hoppe said. “I know this position carries a lot of weight and a lot of responsibility, and that’s the part I really do love. It’s heavier than I expected. I’m sure some of that is self-inflicted. It’s just it’s not fun looking up and seeing crooked numbers on the board. Then you have a start like (José) Soriano’s in Cleveland and it all balances out. I know I’m inexperienced. I know I have a lot to learn, but at the same time, I’m trying to stick to what I know works personally and work with them.” O’Hoppe was behind the plate when Soriano threw six scoreless innings on May 3 at Cleveland, just a few days after that nightmare against the Twins. He was the catcher for all three of the Angels shutouts, including the Soriano start in Cleveland, a Reid Detmers start on April 12 in Boston and a Patrick Sandoval start on May 7 in Pittsburgh. Left-hander Tyler Anderson, who has been the Angels most consistent starter all season, said last week in an interview on MLB Network Radio that O’Hoppe has improved. “From where he was last year to this year, he’s made massive strides on the catching side,” Anderson said. Still, the Angels have a 4.64 ERA, which ranks 27th in the majors. According to some in and around the clubhouse, there have been times when pitch selection has been an issue, as well as execution. Since the establishment of the pitch timer last year, it’s more difficult than ever for pitchers to shake off a sign until they get what they want. Mound visits are now limited to four per game, further impacting the ability of a pitcher and catcher to get on the same page when there are disagreements. Back in 2022, the Angels ranked ninth in the majors in ERA. Most of the pitch calling that season was handled by veteran catchers Max Stassi and Kurt Suzuki. Stassi’s unplanned absence last year left O’Hoppe as the No. 1 catcher, and then he missed four months of the season rehabbing from shoulder surgery. O’Hoppe said he felt like he was trying to take in so much information in such a short time that it was like “drinking out of a fire hose.” Over the winter the Angels’ front office decided not to provide O’Hoppe with a veteran mentor. Catchers Austin Hedges and Martin Maldonado, for example, were both available as free agents. Instead, the Angels are trying to speed up the learning curve by giving O’Hoppe every inning he can handle. He’s started 41 of the Angels’ 53 games. His 369-1/3 innings behind the plate are tied for the fourth most in the majors. Even with a heavy workload this season, O’Hoppe has caught just 98 games in the majors, which is not even one full season for a No. 1 catcher. O’Hoppe acknowledges that he’s still learning, although grudgingly. “I pride of myself for not making excuses,” he said. “Because I’m here; I need to win games and be the best I can be. I do tell myself that (I’m inexperienced) but I don’t think that’s any reason to justify any poor performance or excuse.” Instead of shrugging off the disappointment and chalking it up to growing pains, O’Hoppe said he brings the games home with him. He analyzes the games long after they’re over to see what he could have done differently. “It’s tough to wind down some nights,” O’Hoppe said, “but I know it’s part of it.” O’Hoppe is also going through all of this with a new staff around him. Pitching coach Barry Enright and bullpen coach Steve Karsay, as well as run prevention coordinator Alex Cultice, are all new to the mix of voices in O’Hoppe’s head as he decides which pitches to call more than 120 times a night. Without a veteran catcher to help, O’Hoppe said he’s frequently communicated with Suzuki — now a member of the Angels’ front office — as well as catching coach Jerry Narron and backup catcher Matt Thaiss. Manager Ron Washington neither blamed nor absolved O’Hoppe for the performance of the pitching staff. It is a simple fact that the catcher and pitcher work together, and in this case there’s plenty of inexperience on both sides.

        "description": "Luciana Lourencao, 37, was the first woman to finish the May 5 half-marathon.",
        "content": "He really was entitled. The Brazilian mom whose kids almost stopped her from winning a half-marathon has defended her husband from getting all the blame — saying he was merely following her wishes, which unexpectedly changed when she found herself in first place. Luciana Lourencao, 37, posted a video Sunday to explain the now-viral moment when her husband, businessman Pedro Lourencao, shoved their young daughters her way as she raced to the finish line of the Presidente Prudente race on May 5. “We decided to take the girls to the race so that I could cross the finish line with them,” the personal trainer said, according to a translation by Newsflash. “I wasn’t competing for money, it was a race in my city, and I thought it would have been really nice and cool to create this moment with the children,” she said, insisting the decision was hers. To her surprise, however, Luciana found herself just seconds away from being the first woman to cross the finish line – with another female runner hot on her trail. That was the only reason she ran aside her kids as they rushed out with open arms — not because she was angry at them or her husband, whom online critics ripped as being “entitled” and worthy of divorce. “I needed to get there and that was it. I saw the girls quickly, but I couldn’t stop,” the running mom said in her Instagram update. “The children understood and were not upset. I explained to them that it is very tiring and difficult to run a half marathon,” Luciana maintained. Pedro, 43, said he finds it too painful looking at the comments to their now-viral video. “They kept calling me a saboteur. But they should know that it was this ‘saboteur’ who made two calls so that Luciana could participate in the race, since registration had ended,” he said. “I did everything to get her to go. On Sundays, when she goes to train, we are without her, and I am the one who stays with the girls, and I do so with the greatest pleasure,” he said. Critics were even further off the mark with wild guesses about a bald man Lourencao was seen hugging at the end of the race before turning back to her husband and kids, the shocked mom said. It was not a secret lover — just her brother. “He ran with me just to give me support and encouragement,” she said of her supportive sibling. “He ‘braked’ just before the finish line, so as ‘not to steal my shine’. He was the one I hugged.”",

        "description": "Following the death of NBA legend Bill Walton, Magic Johnson, Julius Erving and more are paying tribute.",
        "content": "It’s rarely ever easy when fans must say goodbye to a beloved sports icon, and today is such an occasion. We have confirmation that legendary NBA center Bill Walton has sadly died at the age of 71. Per the news, the beloved athlete passed away following a prolonged battle with cancer and was surrounded by family and friends at the time. Since the news of Walton’s death broke, numerous fans, sports pundits, current and former players alike have reached out and paid tribute to the hall of famer. And among them are the likes of Magic Johnson Julius “Dr. J” Erving. Magic Johnson, one of the NBA GOATS , is certainly someone who’s had a fair amount of encounters with Bill Walton during his lifetime. The revered athletes played each other more than a few times throughout the ‘70s and ‘80s. And, even after their NBA stints ended, the two remained good friends. Upon learning of his comrade’s passing, Johnson took to X to pay tribute: Rest in peace to a friend, 2X NBA Champion, Hall of Famer, and one of the most skilled centers we’ve ever seen Bill Walton! His NCAA Championship performance as a UCLA Bruin against Memphis is by far the most dominate NCAA Championship performance ever - he shot 21 for 22 and had... May 27, 2024 Julius \"Dr. J.\" Erving also crossed paths with the late basketball player during those aforementioned decades. He paid tribute with an Instagram post that included a sweet photo and caption: A post shared by Julius Erving (@juliuserving) A photo posted by on Born in La Mesa, California on November 5, 1952, the late 6’11” star played college basketball at UCLA, where he led his team to two consecutive championships in 1972 and 1973. While in school, he also won other honors, including three National college player of the year titles. He was ultimately drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers as the first overall pick in the 1974 NBA Draft. As a Blazer, he became an NBA champion in 1977, even earning Finals MVP honors. Additionally, he was named league MVP, made two All-Star teams and reached other benchmarks while in Portland. After leaving the team in 1979, Bill Walton would have a six-year stint with the San Diego Clippers and spend three seasons with the Boston Celtics, where he’d win his second championship. The center retired in 1988 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993. Since then, many continue to admire his heroics on the court, his work ethic and character. ESPN pundit Stephen A. Smith, who’s known to reach out amid personal matters involving NBA players, shared his own tribute to Walton on X. Take a look: ESPN pundit Stephen A. Smith, who’s known to reach out amid personal matters involving NBA players, shared his own tribute to Walton on X. Take a look: Incredibly sad to hear of the passing of my buddy, Bill Walton. His game was ahead of its time, truly one of the greatest big men who ever played. Yet, nothing compared to his passion and love of life, itself. I can hear him now imploring me to “smile......cherish... pic.twitter.com/IBI7Enjr5K May 27, 2024 The former Sixth Man of the Year receives a lot of respect from fellow centers, many of which he blazed a trail for (no pun intended). Fellow Celtic Kendrick Perkins – who works with Stephen A. Smith at ESPN – shared a message of admiration on X following the basketball legend’s death: Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News Rest in Peace to the Legend Bill Walton!!! 🙏🏾 Bill Walton’s passing was confirmed by the National Basketball Association via a press release. It also included a statement from league commissioner Adam Silver, which was shared on Instagram . And he shared some respectful thoughts on the late Walton: Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events – always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered. Of course, the player-turned-sports analyst ( who was hilarious on TV ) also garnered respect from athletes known for other sports. Former New England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman dropped a message of his own on X and added a sweet flourish to the message that alludes to the player’s past status as a Celtic: An absolute legend. RIP Bill Walton☘️ While it’s tough to have to bid farewell to such a beloved man of great character, it’s wonderful when people come together like this to pay tribute. It’s similar to how stars and fans memorialized the late Bill Russell after his passing, and paid tribute after Kobe Bryant's death . Bill Walton may be gone, but he surely won’t be forgotten. And we here at CinemaBlend extend our deepest condolences to his family, friends and loved ones at this time.",

        "content": "AMERICA'S Got Talent has added to an important aspect on the show. Host Terry Crews praised the change and said it was necessary as Season 19 begins. The new season of AGT kicks off on Tuesday, May 28. Terry, 55, sat down with Great Day Hollywood to talk about the judges , the contestants, and the changes they will have this season. After saying that the current judges are the \"dream team,\" he opened up about how the Golden Buzzers will be different this season. The judges - Howie Mandel , Heidi Klum , Sofia Vergara , and Simon Cowell - along with Terry all get a Golden Buzzer. This sends an act that they deem worthy enough to go straight to the live shows without having to go through the rest of the auditions. Typically, the judges and host each get one, and some seasons, they do a group Golden Buzzer. But, for Season 19, there will be nine total Golden Buzzers. The judges will each have two while Terry has one. Terry explained why they upped the number of them. \"What would happen would be the judges would see all this tremendous talent and they would end up apologizing,\" he said. \"They're like, 'Man, if I had another one, I would hit it.'\" \"We said, 'Give them another one!\" Terry shouted. \"And what we found is that there was not one Golden Buzzer wasted because there's so many deserving talents out there.\" \"It's so incredible. I think that the show needed more and now we finally got it and I think everyone is going to be happy,\" Terry ended. What we found is that there was not one Golden Buzzer wasted because there's so many deserving talents out there The host also teased that this season will have the youngest ever contestant at 2 years old. Fans can watch the new season on Tuesday on NBC at 8/7c and the next day on Peacock . This new twist was first announced in March. Simon, 64, opened up about the change when he and his fellow judges were filming the current season. \"In the first two days we’ve used more Golden Buzzers than we’ve ever used - that’s got to be a good sign!” he told People . Simon also serves as the executive producer on the show. Season 19 will feature \"some of the wildest acts to ever grace the AGT stage,\" according to their logline.",

While conducting an investigation, detectives “learned that during the course of 9-10 years, dozens of citizens were being victimized by a serial slingshot shooter,” the Asuza Police Department said in a statement. The man is suspected of breaking windows and car windshields and of narrowly missing people with ball bearings shot from a slingshot, the statement said. No injuries were reported. The man was arrested Thursday after officers served a search warrant and found a slingshot and ball bearings at his home in Asuza, about 25 miles (40 km) east of Los Angeles, police said. Azusa police Lt. Jake Bushey said Saturday that detectives learned that most of the ball bearings were shot from the suspect’s backyard. “We’re not aware of any kind of motive other than just malicious mischief,” Bushey told the Southern California News Group . He was scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday.",

        "content": "Judge Judy Sheindlin is outraged by how out-of-control crime has engulfed some major cities in the United States — but it isn’t a surprise to her, either. “We got here because a small group of people who have very loud voices created a scenario where bad people got rewarded,” Sheindlin told Fox News . “And the victim got punished by the system.” The “scenario” the TV judge is referring to involves actor Steve Buscemi, who was randomly attacked in Manhattan earlier this month by an alleged assailant who would later be identified as a 50-year-old homeless man. While Sheindlin admitted that there are situations why some criminals become criminals, she argued that it shouldn’t always justify their actions, Fox News reported. “There is always a reason for criminal behaviour — didn’t have a good upbringing, didn’t have two parents in the house, didn’t have one parent in the house, there’s always a reason.” She continued: “You’re mentally ill. That’s a reason. You took drugs. That’s a reason. You took alcohol, your brain is fried... Whatever it is.” But she insisted there is “never an excuse for bad behaviour.” Sheindlin added: “And when society started to make excuses for bad behaviour, and react to criminality based upon the excuses, it fell apart.” A post shared by Judy Justice (@judyjustice) She then used New York as an example, after the state raised the minimum age to 18 from 16 for defendants to be prosecuted as adults in criminal cases. The judge called the age change “ridiculous,” adding that if a 17-year-old kills someone, they should “never be allowed to walk the street again because society can’t take a chance.” Sheindlin was also critical of some district attorneys. “When you have district attorneys who are charged, whose job it is to do justice but to keep the community safe... When you have elected district attorneys who don’t know what their job is, they should go find another job,” she said. “Fill ice cream cones someplace. But don’t ruin cities,” she added. “What’s happened around New York City, Portland, San Francisco, you had district attorneys who didn’t know what their job was. And the cities are ruined, people are leaving.” Sheindlin added: “I think we better get smarter before we get lost. Permanently lost.” Sheindlin is currently in her third season of Judy Justice, following her 25-year Judge Judy run. She recalled an interview she did with Morley Safer on 60 Minutes in 1993 where he asked her what family court would be like in the future. “I said, ‘worse. A lot worse,’” she recounted. “And that’s what happened.” She added: “Here we are, 30 years later, and are we in worse shape as a country, as a world, than we were in 1993? You bet your bottom we are.”",

        "content": "SAN DIEGO ( KSWB/KUSI ) — A Carnival cruise ship responded to calls for help and detoured from its normal vacation route on Saturday to help two dozen people stranded at sea off the coast of Mexico. Sailing from its homeport of Long Beach in Southern California, the cruise ship responded to a call from the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Saturday about a small boat full of people who were stranded at sea in the area. According to the cruise line, Carnival Radiance was sailing toward Ensenada, Mexico, Saturday afternoon when they got the call from the Coast Guard. Carnival said the ship was then routed to the location provided and they were able to rescue all 25 people, including three children, who were stranded on a small boat. The Coast Guard said it also launched a small boat and helicopter to assist. Carnival said it then provided food, water and medical assistance to the rescued boaters, while a rendezvous was coordinated with Coast Guard officials. The cruise line noted Carnival Radiance’s three-day cruise from Long Beach will remain on schedule despite the small detour to rescue the boaters in need.",

        "content": "High Power Charging (HPC) available from 0.26 EUR per kilowatt hour (kWh) New IONITY PASSPORT MOTION and IONITY PASSPORT POWER tariffs are designed to cater flexibly to individual charging needs, especially during the upcoming travel season Competitive charging prices and growing IONITY network with up to 350 kW accelerate sustainable mobility across Europe Munich, Germany — IONITY is making High Power Charging (HPC) with up to 350 kW affordable for everyone.

        "content": "DALLAS — Karl-Anthony Towns had seemingly bested his postseason demons through the first two rounds of this year’s playoffs. Sure, there were a few offensive clunkers mixed in, but in general, the all-star big man was great on defense — where he took on marquee matchups — and on the glass and delivered offensively when needed. He helped slam the door on Phoenix in Game 4 of the first-round series sweep. He shot 51 percent from the floor and 39 percent from deep against Denver in the Western Conference semifinals. ADVERTISEMENT After his fair share of past playoff struggles, Towns had apparently found a comfort level on the sport’s biggest, brightest stages. But the Western Conference Finals have told a different story. Through three games — all Wolves losses — Towns is shooting 28 percent from the field and 14 percent from 3-point range. His offensive struggles bottomed out in Sunday’s Game 3 when the big man went 0 for 8 shooting from 3-point range. Timberwolves coach Chris Finch admitted it was “hard to watch” Towns struggle at times Sunday. “He had enough buckets here and there. Defensively, in the second half, I was really pleased with the way he played, rebounding pretty well,” Finch said. “But yeah, he’s struggling. There’s no doubt in that right now.” ADVERTISEMENT Finch felt Towns was rushing his shots earlier in the series. He didn’t think that was the case Sunday, which makes the results all the more inexplicable. One of the NBA’s premiere 3-point shooters missed the rim on multiple good looks from beyond the arc. “He had a couple of good looks and needed those to go down, particularly earlier in the game,” Finch said. And Towns assumed they would. “I feel every shot’s good. I’ve shot a lot of basketballs in my life. I’m the first one in the gym. I definitely am working. I’m shooting. Every time I’m shooting, it feels good,” Towns said. “I’m just having these very unfortunate bounces all the time. It’s annoying. The last game, first shot of the game goes in-out, in-out, in-out. This game, my first shot is a free throw and it goes in-out. I don’t mean to smile, but I’ve just got to laugh at it right now. It’s very disappointing.” ADVERTISEMENT Towns said his confidence level remains “extremely high.” He noted he’s putting up “1,500 shots a day,” a fact the Inside the NBA television crew vehemently disputed after Game 3. Regardless, Towns has a large body of work upon which he can rely to know future shots will fall. Wolves forward Kyle Anderson agreed 3-point shots will go down for Towns. But there are certainly other ways he can get himself going in the meantime. That was evident in the third quarter Sunday, when — after Dallas big man Dereck Lively left the game due to injury — Towns started to go downhill aggressively in an effort to attack the rack. “Put me in spots where I was getting the ball in the mid-post, Dallas action,” Towns said, “and I was utilizing that one-two step to the basket for my advantage.” Perhaps more of that will be required until Towns regains his shooting touch. Because this much is apparent – if Towns can’t find ways to be an offensive contributor, it will be difficult for the Wolves to extend their season. There simply aren’t enough shooters or offensive creators for Minnesota to survive these major lulls from its all-star big man. ADVERTISEMENT Take the second half Sunday, for example. When Towns was 3 for 4 from the field with nine points in the third period, the Wolves dropped 35 points in the quarter — their most impressive offensive segment of the series. When Towns is rolling, it opens up the floor for everyone else — starting with Anthony Edwards. But, in the fourth quarter, Towns regressed again, going 0 for 4 shooting from the field, and Minnesota scored just 20 points in the period en route to another crushing defeat. If Dallas doesn’t have to account for Towns on offense, the floor shrinks for Minnesota in short order. Towns has shot below 35 percent from the floor in nine of his 30 career playoff games, and the Wolves are 0-9 in those games. ADVERTISEMENT “I think KAT gotta just do a better job of maybe getting back to his old self, of finding himself around the basket more. Rim running, taking advantage of mismatches,” Anderson said. “He’s obviously a really good player, and he’s big time for us, so we need him to get going. So it’s our job to put him in the right position. ... But I think if he gets back to rim running and catching the ball on the block and taking his time and going to finish, they got nothing for him. So we just gotta find him, put him in the right situations.” ______________________________________________________ This story was written by one of our partner news agencies.

        "content": "DALLAS — Karl-Anthony Towns had seemingly bested his postseason demons through the first two rounds of this year’s playoffs. Sure, there were a few offensive clunkers mixed in, but in general, the all-star big man was great on defense — where he took on marquee matchups — and on the glass and delivered offensively when needed. He helped slam the door on Phoenix in Game 4 of the first-round series sweep. He shot 51 percent from the floor and 39 percent from deep against Denver in the Western Conference semifinals. ADVERTISEMENT After his fair share of past playoff struggles, Towns had apparently found a comfort level on the sport’s biggest, brightest stages. But the Western Conference Finals have told a different story. Through three games — all Wolves losses — Towns is shooting 28 percent from the field and 14 percent from 3-point range. His offensive struggles bottomed out in Sunday’s Game 3 when the big man went 0 for 8 shooting from 3-point range. Timberwolves coach Chris Finch admitted it was “hard to watch” Towns struggle at times Sunday. “He had enough buckets here and there. Defensively, in the second half, I was really pleased with the way he played, rebounding pretty well,” Finch said. “But yeah, he’s struggling. There’s no doubt in that right now.” ADVERTISEMENT Finch felt Towns was rushing his shots earlier in the series. He didn’t think that was the case Sunday, which makes the results all the more inexplicable. One of the NBA’s premiere 3-point shooters missed the rim on multiple good looks from beyond the arc. “He had a couple of good looks and needed those to go down, particularly earlier in the game,” Finch said. And Towns assumed they would. “I feel every shot’s good. I’ve shot a lot of basketballs in my life. I’m the first one in the gym. I definitely am working. I’m shooting. Every time I’m shooting, it feels good,” Towns said. “I’m just having these very unfortunate bounces all the time. It’s annoying. The last game, first shot of the game goes in-out, in-out, in-out. This game, my first shot is a free throw and it goes in-out. I don’t mean to smile, but I’ve just got to laugh at it right now. It’s very disappointing.” ADVERTISEMENT Towns said his confidence level remains “extremely high.” He noted he’s putting up “1,500 shots a day,” a fact the Inside the NBA television crew vehemently disputed after Game 3. Regardless, Towns has a large body of work upon which he can rely to know future shots will fall. Wolves forward Kyle Anderson agreed 3-point shots will go down for Towns. But there are certainly other ways he can get himself going in the meantime. That was evident in the third quarter Sunday, when — after Dallas big man Dereck Lively left the game due to injury — Towns started to go downhill aggressively in an effort to attack the rack. “Put me in spots where I was getting the ball in the mid-post, Dallas action,” Towns said, “and I was utilizing that one-two step to the basket for my advantage.” Perhaps more of that will be required until Towns regains his shooting touch. Because this much is apparent – if Towns can’t find ways to be an offensive contributor, it will be difficult for the Wolves to extend their season. There simply aren’t enough shooters or offensive creators for Minnesota to survive these major lulls from its all-star big man. ADVERTISEMENT Take the second half Sunday, for example. When Towns was 3 for 4 from the field with nine points in the third period, the Wolves dropped 35 points in the quarter — their most impressive offensive segment of the series. When Towns is rolling, it opens up the floor for everyone else — starting with Anthony Edwards. But, in the fourth quarter, Towns regressed again, going 0 for 4 shooting from the field, and Minnesota scored just 20 points in the period en route to another crushing defeat. If Dallas doesn’t have to account for Towns on offense, the floor shrinks for Minnesota in short order. Towns has shot below 35 percent from the floor in nine of his 30 career playoff games, and the Wolves are 0-9 in those games. ADVERTISEMENT “I think KAT gotta just do a better job of maybe getting back to his old self, of finding himself around the basket more. Rim running, taking advantage of mismatches,” Anderson said. “He’s obviously a really good player, and he’s big time for us, so we need him to get going. So it’s our job to put him in the right position. ... But I think if he gets back to rim running and catching the ball on the block and taking his time and going to finish, they got nothing for him. So we just gotta find him, put him in the right situations.” ______________________________________________________ This story was written by one of our partner news agencies.

Rim running, taking advantage of mismatches,” Anderson said. “He’s obviously a really good player, and he’s big time for us, so we need him to get going. So it’s our job to put him in the right position. ... But I think if he gets back to rim running and catching the ball on the block and taking his time and going to finish, they got nothing for him. So we just gotta find him, put him in the right situations.” ______________________________________________________ This story was written by one of our partner news agencies.

        "content": "BALTIMORE — The Red Sox had a scoring opportunity in the fourth inning. Down 2-0, they loaded the bases with one out. But Dominic Smith struck out looking and Ceddanne Rafaela went down swinging as Orioles starter Cole Irvin escaped. Baltimore then put a five-spot on the scoreboard in the bottom of the fourth to take a 7-0 lead. The Red Sox lost 11-3 to the Orioles at Camden Yards. Boston dropped to .500 (27-27). Starter Cooper Criswell entered with a 2.86 ERA in eight outings (seven starts). But he gave up seven runs (six earned runs), six hits and one walk while striking out two in 4 innings. The first five Baltimore batters reached in the fourth. Ryan Mountcastle doubled. Second baseman Vaughn Grissom’s error allowed Colton Cowser to reach. Criswell then issued his only free pass, walking Jordan Westburg to load the bases. Kyle Stowers followed with a two-run double, then Cedric Mullins ripped a two-run triple. Jorge Mateo’s RBI sac fly made it 7-0. Rafaela showed both the good and bad. He made a heck of a running catch on Mullins’ 382-foot, 104.1 mph liner to center field in the sixth inning. He crashed into the wall after making the grab. But his strikeout to end the fourth came on a curveball well near the dirt. Rafaela entered Monday with a 42.1% chase percentage, which ranks in the third percentile among MLB hitters. The Red Sox fell behind 11-0 before scoring three runs in the eighth on Romy Gonzalez’s three-run triple. Brad Keller , who the Red Sox signed as a free agent Sunday, pitched the final four innings. He gave up four runs on seven hits and one walk while striking out two.",

        "content": "A coroner's inquest into the death of Haven Dubois is underway at the Royal Hotel in Regina. Dubois was 14 when he was found unresponsive in Pilot Butte Creek, in the east end of Regina, on May 20, 2015. A coroner's report prepared in 2016 found Haven's death to be an accidental drowning and listed marijuana use as a contributing factor. Regina police ruled out foul play in their investigation. Public inquest scheduled in death of 14-year-old who drowned in Regina creek in 2015 Since Haven's death his mother, Richelle Dubois, who began testifying today, has insisted there is more to the story. So far, her testimony has covered the morning leading up to her son's death. She spent more than a decade advocating for further investigation into his death, and took part in the Justice for Our Stolen Children camp outside the Saskatchewan Legislature in 2018. Richelle Dubois, mother of Haven Dubois, has spent years pushing for further investigation into what happened to her son in 2015. (Laura Sciarpelletti/CBC) In 2023, the family marched to Ottawa to call for a national inquiry into missing, murdered and neglected Indigenous boys, men and two-spirited people. On Monday morning, more than nine year's after Haven's death, the inquest, presided over by Coroner Brent Gough, got underway. Six people, four men and two women, were chosen to sit on the inquest jury, including three who are Indigenous. Family of Haven Dubois marching to Ottawa to call for national inquiry Over the next four days they will hear from 13 witnesses before determining who died, when and where that person died and the medical cause and manner of death. They could also provide recommendations so that similar deaths do not occur in the future.",

Monday's game has been postponed because of heavy rain rolling through the New York City area . The game was supposed to start at 4:10 p.m., but has been rescheduled for the same time on Tuesday, as part of a doubleheader. The second game will start approximately 30 minutes after the first one finishes. Fans who had tickets for Monday's game cannot use them on Tuesday, but they will receive a voucher for a future game. Fans with tickets for Tuesday will now be able to attend both games of the doubleheader. Many who had the day off for Memorial Day shared their disappointment on social media , with some calling for a roof over Citi Field. The Mets have lost 10 of their past 13 games. They ended a five-game losing streak on Sunday , rallying for three runs in the ninth inning to beat San Francisco 4-3. The NL West-leading Dodgers have lost five straight games, their longest skid since six in a row in April 2019. Tylor Megill was slated to start Monday for the Mets, and Gavin Stone was due on the mound for the Dodgers. Megill will now start the first game Tuesday against Dodgers' Tylor Glasnow, and Stone will start the second game against Mets' Jose Quintana.

        "content": "It's about time that we got new smartwatches from Samsung. The company has been working on a new lineup that we now know includes the and Watch 7 Ultra models. As it stands, the company is expected to unveil these devices at its Unpacked event on July 10, where it's also going to unveil the new foldable phones. The Galaxy Watch lineup has been due for a design upgrade. The recent models have largely looked the same. Admittedly, there's only so much you can do, design-wise, on a device that as small as a smartwatch. Samsung has made efforts over the years, fine-tuning and making adjustments while retaining the circular design that has made its smartwatches so popular. Smartwatches came in all shorts of shapes back when the Galaxy Watch was trying to establish a footing in the market. Samsung made the conscious decision of choosing a circular shape, one that made it look like a conventional watch the most. Even though regular watches are also available in a wide variety of unique styles, it's the circular that remains the most popular. Evidently, the idea from the get-go has been to provide customers with a familiar look and feel while offering them functionality that one simply doesn't get on a conventional watch. Since the Galaxy Watch series went circular in its design language there haven't been very many significant changes, but that's now set to change. The first show an entirely new design. It's a mix of squarish and circular, certainly unique as far as smartwatches are concerned, but horologically-inclined would be quick to see the similarities between this design and that of some conventional watches, particularly those from Swiss watchmaker Panerai. Panerai's smartwatches, particularly the Luminor series, is instantly recongizable because of its squarish and circular design. It's one of those few watch lineups that have retained their iconic design over decades. Others that come to mind include the Rolex Submariner, the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak, and the Patek Philippe Nautilus. The Luminor watches from Panerai are well known for their cushion-like cases with a circular dial and a distinct bridge that protects the crown. If you look at these watches close enough, it's easy to see where some inspiration has been drawn from for the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra. Sure enough, Samsung's smartwatches haven't had a “crown” like the Apple Watch, but the addition of a new button in the center is just as close to putting a digital crown on the smartwatch as Samsung has come. It's not a bad thing that the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra seems to be inspired by an iconic watch lineup, on the contrary, I think that it'll make watch lovers like myself gain more interest in smartwatches. For far too long, device makers have approached smartwatch design the same way as they have for smartphones and other products. Watches are supposed to be far more evocative. They can be heirlooms passed in the family for generations, incredible works of mechanical engineering, pieces of jewelry decked out with the finest gems, and they can also be signs of success. Smartwatches may be able to do a lot more than a normal watch, but they've remained soulless products, devoid of the capability to foster any emotion or connection in users. They'll just get rid of the one they bought last year to get the latest one that's come out this year. You don't see many people doing that with an Audemars or a Patek. That's not to say that the changes Samsung has made to the design of puts it in the same league as those giants, but at least now it doesn't look like yet another cookie-cutter smartwatch. Ever since smartwatches took off it felt like regardless of the manufacturer, they were there to confine regular watches to the dustbin of history. There was a sense of arrogance about them, that since they could help keep the user connected 24/7, regular watches will have no place in the future. On the other hand, the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra's inspiration appears to have been drawn from a place of respect. It doesn't seek to destroy an established order, rather, it pays homage to the centuries-old tradition of watchmaking that have given us some truly amazing designs. I've said it before, the key to getting more regular watch users to buy a smartwatch is to make them look a lot more like conventional watches. Samsung has clearly seen that this approach works, its circular models have remained a customer favorite, so it's now kicking things up a notch and adopting a design language that's highly regarded among the watch lover community. It's as if the new smartwatch from Samsung is striking a balance between being unapologetically tech-forward with , larger display, and improved battery life, while being respectful of the conventional watch industry. I imagine that a lot more regular watch owners will look at the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra and want to buy one, because it provides them with a chance to experience something new on something that doesn't look too foreign. I know I will, I've been literally craving this smartwatch ever since the leaked renders surfaced online. Will others feel the same way? Only time (pun intended) will tell.",

        "description": "Dedication to creating the Soldiers Field Veterans Memorial was saluted during the annual holiday ceremony with a look to future expansion.",
        "content": "ROCHESTER — Hundreds of area residents gathered at the Soldiers Field Veterans Memorial on Monday to honor the thousands of veterans it represents, but one name stood out during the annual ceremony. “Wayne (Stillman) wanted the enduring message of veterans and their contributions to our society and to our very lives to live on well past his life,” Olmsted County Commissioner Dave Senjem said as he spoke as a last-minute addition to the program. Stillman, who helped shepherd the memorial’s creation, died May 15 . A day earlier, taps was sounded at the memorial in Stillman’s honor, but Senjem said Stillman wouldn’t appreciate the special attention on Monday as veterans and families gathered to remember lost comrades and loved ones. “It was never about Wayne,” said Senjem, who served as a co-founder of the memorial committee with Stillman and others. “It was always about the veterans and their service and sacrifice.” ADVERTISEMENT That service and sacrifice remained the cornerstone of Monday’s ceremony as a variety of traditions were honored, just as they’ve been since the memorial was dedicated in 2000. A procession brought flags honoring the nation, as well as a variety of veterans’ service organizations. Patriotic music, prayers and readings highlighted the history and service as memories were shared. The Rev. Nathan Brand, senior pastor of Berean Community Church, said sharing those memories is important. “We tend to forget things that are unpleasant or inconvenient or not immediately right in front of us,” he said during the ceremony’s main address. He said the location of Monday’s event was an important reminder that freedom comes at a cost and that cost needs to be recognized, which is what Stillman and others set out to do in 1995 when the idea of the memorial emerged. “This is a special place; it did not just happen,” Brand said, pointing to the dedication needed to build the memorial without tax dollars. The memorial features details of military action from the Civil War through 1991’s Operation Desert Storm, but Brand said it isn’t about those actions. It’s about the people who were called to serve. “It’s a special place,” he said. “It’s not a war memorial; it is a veterans’ memorial.” ADVERTISEMENT Work on the memorial is expected to continue, with a new phase emerging, according to memorial board member Rod Haworth. “The addition will memorialize the time from 1991 to the events that led to Sept. 11 (in 2001) and everything that happened afterward,” he said, pointing out the new wall is expected to circle the existing memorial and provide space for another 130 years of history. Haworth said the intention is to provide space for future generations to remember the valor and sacrifice that resulted from the war on terrorism and other actions, but he added that it can also send a message that helps deter the need for adding etchings to the wall. “The big black ominous wall is something you don’t want to add to,” he said. A proposed design for the new wall is expected to be completed in time for this year’s Sept. 11 commemoration, but Haworth said a timeline for construction hasn’t been finalized. He said it’s likely to take a similar path to the five years it took to build the original memorial. One smaller addition is being planned in the meantime. Senjem said a bench honoring Stillman's effort is being planned for space at the entrance to the memorial. ADVERTISEMENT",

        "content": "As a female has clashed with yet another star, this time K-Pop singer Yoona, we're taking a look at all of the celebrities Marking her the third incident in the spotlight, an anonymous security guard at the once again clashed with a star on the red carpet. Throughout the annual film festival - which ran from May 14 to 25 in Cannes, - the unnamed guard has been caught in tension-filled moments with Yoona, Destiny's Child star , and actress Massiel Taveras. The first instance that sparked tension on the red carpet was when Destiny's Child star Kelly Rowland was seen getting into a heated confrontation with the security guard after feeling targeted while attending the ceremony. During the incident, Kelly was climbing the steps of the ceremony. Kelly shared a tense confrontation with the guard in which Kelly was seen turning and wagging her finger in her face. Later Kelly opened up about the tense interaction as she claimed that the security guard wasn't scolding people who \"didn't look like her.\" In an interview with the singer said: \"That woman knows what happened. I know what happened. I have a boundary and I stand by those boundaries,\" and added: \"There were other women that attended that carpet who did not quite look like me and they didn’t get scolded, or pushed off, or told to get off. I stood my ground and she felt like she had to stand hers. But I stood my ground.” After the encounter, a lip reader told Page Six that Kelly said: \"Don’t talk to me like that. Don’t talk to me like that. You’re not my mother. I told you not to talk to me like that.\" However, the star has not confirmed if that's what she said during their conversation. Dominican actress Massiel Taveras seemed to find herself in a very similar situation as Kelly on the red carpet as she was captured having a heated encounter with the same guard. In a viral clip on X, formerly Twitter, the star was seen walking down the red carpet in a white gown with a massive train featuring what seemed to be the face of Jesus on it that she was unfolding when she was scolded by the employee. As she went up the stars, Massiel was seen talking to the security guard as the guard held her arm up attempting to rush her up the stairs. And as she paused to attempt to situate her dress, Massiel was seen shoving the security guard's arm way from her. After this, Massiel turned to wave to her fans before the guard once again put her arm up and tried to move her from the carpet. Neither party has spoken out on the encounter since it took place. In the last and most recent incident, famous K-Pop singer Yoona was seen climbing the steps of the venue and turning to wave to fans just for the staffer to block her with her arm and usher her away. While Yonna didn't exchange any words with the guard, it was clear that she was frustrated and upset by the encounter from her facial expression and body language. Yoona has yet to speak out on the incident. Following all of the controversy, many fans are calling for the security guard to be fired from her position after so many tense encounters. In the wake of all the news, the security guard's fellow staffer spoke out and defended her actions in the incident involving Kelly. The unnamed employee told the : \"She was an usher working under a lot of pressure to keep people on the carpet moving, so as to stop crowds building up,\" and added: \"There was no pushing or shoving, or scolding. Security and safety are the priorities, along with keeping to strict timetables set according to contracts — even the celebrities have to stick to the rules.\"",

In March, Helen revealed she suffered a psychotic breakdown at the beginning of the year after splitting from her ex of 13 years, Scott Sinclair. And the former Coronation Street star, 33, took to Instagram on Sunday to share that she feels like a 'horrible mummy' being away from her kids - Charlie, six, and Matilda, eight - when they spend time with their father Scott. Helen shared an adorable video with her son, as she admitted 'not being as present with Charlie as I was with the girls' due to splitting from Scott when her youngest was just one.

Helen Flanagan shared a candid post on Instagram on Sunday about the 'mum guilt' she feels over her youngest child Charlie as she opened up about life as a single mother The former Coronation Street star, 33, took to Instagram on Sunday to share that she feels like a 'horrible mummy' being away from her kids - Charlie, six, and Matilda, eight - when they spend time with their father Scott 'I suppose mum guilt never goes no matter what you do x They went on holiday with their lovely nanna too which helps me as I get lots of pictures of them looking really happy x.' In the video shared by Helen, she looked angelic in a floaty white summer halterneck summer dress, as she curled her blonde locks and tied them up with a ribbon. Her and Charlie shared a sweet moment as they cuddled on a picnic blanket and made funny faces together. Of her own health following her breakdown earlier this year, Helen said in her post: ' Feeling in such a better place then I did this time last year and I think it's just time, it's a massive healer and I look back at myself this time last year and I can give myself kindness and compassion for maybe looking for love in the wrong places and numbing how I felt x. ' As mummys we just do our best at that time x. Maybe I've not always got it right but always had the right intentions x. I feel like I've changed so many times since Matilda was born and that we have grown together and our bond is really special x.' Helen opened up about going through her separation from Scott while Charlie was a baby, saying: ' Charlie was one when me and his dad split and I remember in the build up to us separating I was still breast feeding and I couldn't get my baby boy off the boob and it made me feel quite trapped and stuck as I couldn't do anything on my own independently as my baby needed to be stuck with me all the time and he would just cry for me and maybe because everything felt a lot emotionally when I finally got Charlie off the boob at 14months with help from a nanny. In March, Helen revealed she suffered a psychotic breakdown at the beginning of the year after splitting from her ex of 13 years, Scott Sinclair (Pictured in 2019) Helen shared an adorable video with her son, as she admitted 'not being as present with Charlie as I was with the girls' due to splitting from Scott when her youngest was just one 'Not seen my babies for 11 days as they were in Dubai with their daddy x,' Helen wrote In the video shared by Helen, she looked angelic in a floaty white summer halterneck summer dress, as she curled her blonde locks and tied them up with a ribbon Of her own health following her breakdown earlier this year, Helen said in her post: ' Feeling in such a better place then I did this time last year and I think it's just time' 'I needed my space to get my head together and to feel like my own person and not just a mother but a woman too x. 'I do feel guilty for maybe not being as present with Charlie as I was with the girls. I struggled to sit and just play with him.' She added: 'To be honest I struggled to be in the house too much as it all felt a bit sad. Their daddy moved away for football and originally he surprised me with our family home that me and the kids live in and I suppose at the beginning I just didn't want to take on the reality that it really was just me now and the three little ones. 'That was just a bit much for me. The beginning of the year was tricky and I felt so guilty for not being my best. 'I know I'll have such a beautiful relationship with Charlie and the girls. Feel in such a happier place this summer and I'm so grateful ✨.' The heartfelt post comes after she revealed the heartbreaking details of a psychotic breakdown she suffered earlier this year. Taking to Instagram in March, Helen revealed that across January and February she was fighting a secret battle with her mental health after her split from Scott Sinclair. Helen has admitted just how scary the breakdown was as she revealed she was seeing things and felt like she was in danger all the time after having a reaction to her ADHD medication (pictured her children Matilda, eight, Delilah, five, and Charlie, two) The couple called it quits on their relationship back in 2022 after spending 13 years together but are in a better place to co-parent now After suffering a bad reaction to her medication as she explained: 'It was really sad and very scary.

Opening up the The Mirror , she confessed she struggled to deal with the split: 'I don't see it as a break-up, I see it as a divorce. We were together 13 years. But instead of processing it all, I threw myself into work and shut off my emotions. 'I just went into survival mode. Then it all came to the surface earlier this year and I was mentally and physically breaking down.' She then started medicating for her ADHD and suffered a bad reaction to her medication as she explained: 'It was really sad and very scary. I was seeing things and I felt like I was in danger all the time.'

        "content": "PARIS — Bianca Andreescu was victorious in her return from an injury layoff of nearly 10 months with a 7-5, 6-1 win over Spain's Sara Sorribes Tormo in first-round action Monday at the French Open. The 23-year-old from Mississauga, Ont., showed some rust in letting a 4-2 lead in the first set slip away before recovering. She elevated her game in a dominant second set and wrapped up the win in 94 minutes. Andreescu, who hadn't played since sustaining a back injury at the National Bank Open in Montreal last August, will face No. 23 seed Anna Kalinskaya of Russia in the second round on Thursday. The former world No. 4 and 2019 U.S. Open champion is looking to advance past the third round at Roland-Garros for the first time in her career. Andreescu's result was part of a successful day for Canadians at the clay-court Grand Slam with Felix Auger-Aliassime, Leylah Fernandez and Denis Shapovalov, all posting comfortable wins. Montreal's Auger-Aliassime was a 6-2, 6-4, 6-4 winner over Japan's Yoshihito Nishioka, while Fernandez, from Laval, Que., downed Jessika Ponchet of France 6-2, 6-0. Auger-Aliassime fired seven aces and won 84 per cent of his first serves in a match marred by two rain delays. Fernandez, meanwhile, opened with her first of five breaks in a match that took just 69 minutes to complete. Neither Auger-Aliassime nor Fernandez faced break point. Auger-Aliassime, seeded 21st in Paris, will next face German qualifier Henn Squire. The 31st-seeded Fernandez will next play China's Wang Xiyu. Later Monday, Shapovalov, of Richmond Hill, Ont., beat Luca Van Assche of France 6-3, 6-4, 6-4, completing a clean sweep for Canada, as not one Canadian player dropped a set in four matches. Shapovalov will next play the winner of Monday's match between Mattia Bellucci and Frances Tiafoe. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. The Canadian Press",

        "description": "PARIS — Bianca Andreescu was victorious in her return from an injury layoff of nearly 10 months with a 7-5, 6-1 win over Spain's Sara Sorribes Tormo in first-round action Monday at the French Open. The 23-year-old from Mississauga, Ont.",
        "content": "PARIS — Bianca Andreescu was victorious in her return from an injury layoff of nearly 10 months with a 7-5, 6-1 win over Spain's Sara Sorribes Tormo in first-round action Monday at the French Open. The 23-year-old from Mississauga, Ont., showed some rust in letting a 4-2 lead in the first set slip away before recovering. She elevated her game in a dominant second set and wrapped up the win in 94 minutes. Andreescu, who hadn't played since sustaining a back injury at the National Bank Open in Montreal last August, will face No. 23 seed Anna Kalinskaya of Russia in the second round on Thursday. The former world No. 4 and 2019 U.S. Open champion is looking to advance past the third round at Roland-Garros for the first time in her career. Andreescu's result was part of a successful day for Canadians at the clay-court Grand Slam with Felix Auger-Aliassime, Leylah Fernandez and Denis Shapovalov, all posting comfortable wins. Montreal's Auger-Aliassime was a 6-2, 6-4, 6-4 winner over Japan's Yoshihito Nishioka, while Fernandez, from Laval, Que., downed Jessika Ponchet of France 6-2, 6-0. Auger-Aliassime fired seven aces and won 84 per cent of his first serves in a match marred by two rain delays. Fernandez, meanwhile, opened with her first of five breaks in a match that took just 69 minutes to complete. Neither Auger-Aliassime nor Fernandez faced break point. Auger-Aliassime, seeded 21st in Paris, will next face German qualifier Henn Squire. The 31st-seeded Fernandez will next play China's Wang Xiyu. Later Monday, Shapovalov, of Richmond Hill, Ont., beat Luca Van Assche of France 6-3, 6-4, 6-4, completing a clean sweep for Canada, as not one Canadian player dropped a set in four matches. Shapovalov will next play the winner of Monday's match between Mattia Bellucci and Frances Tiafoe. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. The Canadian Press",

The following has been released by the NBA. pic.twitter.com/fdlty5X3F5 Bill Walton's storied basketball career began with NCAA men's basketball dominance at UCLA . Walton was the number one draft pick in the 1974 NBA draft, selected by the Portland Trailblazers. Walton's NBA career was highlighted by two NBA championship seasons that both included playoff series against the Chicago Bulls. In 1977, Walton and his eventual NBA Champion Portland Trailblazers team faced the Chicago Bulls in the NBA Western Conference first round, best-of-three series . The Trailblazers defeated the Bulls 2-1 in the 1977 NBA Western Conference first round series. Walton in the resurgent twilight of his career would face the Bulls in another playoff series in 1986 as a member of the Boston Celtics . Earning individual accolade as the 1986 NBA Sixth-Man of the Year, Walton provided key bench minutes in the Celtics' NBA Eastern Conference first-round matchup against a young Chicago Bulls team led by second-year emerging superstar Michael Jordan. The 1986-87 NBA season proved to be Bill Walton's final season of active NBA playing time. Walton spent the 1987-88 NBA season on the Celtics injury list and formally retired from the NBA in 1990. Starting in 1990, Walton transitioned to television broadcasting as a basketball color commentator, initially for CBS, and notably for Bulls fans on NBC from 1990 to 2002. Bill Walton was a prominent broadcast voice during the Chicago Bulls second three-peat era of NBA Championship victories from 1996 to 1998, both in-studio and in live-game broadcasts.

        "content": "After making his mark on numerous classic projects and memorable moments in the Ghanaian music scene, the talented and versatile artist Dayonthetrack embarks on a new journey with his mixtape/EP titled “Black & White: Before the Tape.” This release paves the way for his highly anticipated debut album. Dayonthetrack is set to release an exciting 5-song project on May 24, 2024, featuring impressive collaborations that promise to create a significant buzz in the rapidly growing industry. “Black & White: Before the Tape” boasts a diverse lineup blending hip-hop, trap soul, afropop, and afro fusion. The first track, “Life Lessons,” reflects on Dayonthetrack’s journey, addressing betrayal and his experiences in the industry. He poignantly describes the industry as a “burrow filled with poisonous snakes” and discusses spiritual maturity, enlightenment, and the pressures from younger family members who look up to him. He offers advice on navigating the treacherous nature of the music world. The second song, “Sticky Situation,” features one of Ghana’s top rappers, Kofi Mole. This track hints at Dayonthetrack’s experiences with his former label, with lyrics like “now we no be friends” suggesting it addresses rumours surrounding the GROUND UP CHALE label artists. Despite Dayonthetrack denying these speculations, the song clearly comes from a place of sorrow. The project also includes a remix of his breakout afropop hit “Ashawo,” featuring Nigerian afropop star YKB, who recently received major recognition from global superstar Wizkid. In conclusion, Dayonthetrack is evidently putting substantial effort into his projects and brand-building. From the vibrant Rap City Tema, we eagerly anticipate the emergence of yet another remarkable talent. Listen on all platforms here https://vyd.co/Blackwhitebeforethetape",

        "content": "CHICAGO (AP) — A Chicago man convicted of murder based in part on testimony from a legally blind eyewitness is suing the city and the police department. A judge convicted Darien Harris in 2014 in connection with a fatal shooting at a South Side gas station in 2011. He was 12 years into a 76-year prison sentence when he was freed in December after showed that the eyewitness had advanced glaucoma and lied about his eyesight issues. Harris was 30 years old when he went free. Harris filed a federal civil rights lawsuit in April alleging police fabricated evidence and coerced witnesses into making false statements, Monday. He told the newspaper that he is still struggling to put his life back together. “I don’t have any financial help. I’m still (treated like) a felon, so I can’t get a good job. It’s hard for me to get into school,” he said. “I’ve been so lost. ... I feel like they took a piece of me that is hard for me to get back.” A message The Associated Press left on the city’s Law Department main line seeking comment Monday wasn’t immediately returned. The department provides attorneys for the city, its departments and its employees. Harris was an 18-year-old high school senior when he was arrested. The legally blind eyewitness picked Harris out of a police lineup and identified him in court. The eyewitness testified that he was riding his motorized scooter near the gas station when he heard gunshots and saw a person aiming a handgun. He also added that the shooter bumped into him. Harris’ trial attorney asked the witness if his diabetes affected his vision. He said yes but denied he had vision problems. But the man’s doctor deemed him legally blind nine years before the incident, court records show. A gas station attendant also testified that Harris wasn’t the shooter. The Exoneration Project has helped clear more than 200 people since 2009, including a dozen in Chicago’s Cook County in 2023 alone. The Associated Press",

CHICAGO (AP) — A Chicago man convicted of murder based in part on testimony from a legally blind eyewitness is suing the city and the police department. A judge convicted Darien Harris in 2014 in connection with a fatal shooting at a South Side gas station in 2011. He was 12 years into a 76-year prison sentence when he was freed in December after The Exoneration Project showed that the eyewitness had advanced glaucoma and lied about his eyesight issues. Harris was 30 years old when he went free. Harris filed a federal civil rights lawsuit in April alleging police fabricated evidence and coerced witnesses into making false statements, the Chicago Tribune reported Monday. He told the newspaper that he is still struggling to put his life back together. “I don’t have any financial help. I’m still (treated like) a felon, so I can’t get a good job. It’s hard for me to get into school,” he said. “I’ve been so lost. ... I feel like they took a piece of me that is hard for me to get back.” A message The Associated Press left on the city’s Law Department main line seeking comment Monday wasn’t immediately returned. The department provides attorneys for the city, its departments and its employees. Harris was an 18-year-old high school senior when he was arrested. The legally blind eyewitness picked Harris out of a police lineup and identified him in court. The eyewitness testified that he was riding his motorized scooter near the gas station when he heard gunshots and saw a person aiming a handgun. He also added that the shooter bumped into him. Harris’ trial attorney asked the witness if his diabetes affected his vision. He said yes but denied he had vision problems. But the man’s doctor deemed him legally blind nine years before the incident, court records show. A gas station attendant also testified that Harris wasn’t the shooter. The Exoneration Project has helped clear more than 200 people since 2009, including a dozen in Chicago’s Cook County in 2023 alone. Advertisement",

Alabama-based Vulcan Materials said in a statement Monday that offer “substantially undervalues our assets.” In papers filed on the case in an international arbitration panel, Vulcan Materials valued the almost 6,000-acre (2,400 hectare) property, located just south of the resort town of Playa del Carmen, at $1.9 billion.

The company’s dock at Punta Venado is the only one in the area that can handle cement, crushed stone and other shipments for the Maya Train. The 950-mile (1,500-kilometer) Maya Train line is meant to run in a rough loop around the Yucatan Peninsula, connecting beach resorts and archaeological sites.

The Mexican president has in the past threatened to expropriate the extensive property, claiming the pits it has dug to extract crushed limestone have damaged the fragile system of underground rivers and caves in the area. But Vulcan Materials rejected the charge. “Our operations have not adversely affected underground caves, cenotes or archaeological sites. In fact, we have mapped, protected and preserved these valuable resources,” the company said in a statement. Instead, the company alleged that some other quarries in the area have been operating unlawfully. “Unlike other quarrying sites that have been operating unlawfully to supply the Mayan Train, our operations were duly permitted,” the company said. The Mayan Train is a pet project of López Obrador to build a tourist train around the Yucatan peninsula. Activists, cave divers and archeologist say the project has damaged the caves, which hold some of the oldest human remains in North America. The president’s office had no immediate reaction to Vulcan’s allegations. López Obrador has said in the past that the most attractive part of the property was the company’s freight shipping dock — the only deep port on the coast’s mainland — which he plans to turn into a dock for cruise ships. He says he wants to turn the rest of the property into a natural reserve. Monday mornings The latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week. “The Mexican government is using these political threats and false allegations to try to justify converting our property into a “naturally protected area,” which could — ironically — be used not to protect the environment but for commercial tourism purposes and naval operations, including cruise ship activity”, the company said. López Obrador said he also wants to use the flooded pits that the company dug out of hundreds of acres of the limestone soil as “swimming pools” or an “ecotourism” area that would be operated as a concession by a private operator. The huge pits are inhabited by crocodiles, which are a protected species in Mexico. The company’s dock at Punta Venado is the only one in the area that can handle cement, crushed stone and other shipments for the Maya Train. The 950-mile (1,500-kilometer) Maya Train line is meant to run in a rough loop around the Yucatan Peninsula, connecting beach resorts and archaeological sites. López Obrador touts the train as a way to bring some of Cancun’s tourism income to inland communities that haven’t shared in the wealth. But there are no credible feasibility studies showing tourists would want to use the train. Advertisement Advertisement",

        "content": "Residents of central Mexico may have thought they were accompanying Dante through the I nferno in a freakishly wild weekend for weather. Extreme heat, destructively strong winds and a consequential hail storm — all accompanied by flooding — tormented central Mexico beginning on Friday. In a “be careful what you wish for” moment, residents of the city of Puebla, who may have been wishing for relief from the heat wave , were stunned by a wicked storm that pounded them with hail for 30 minutes on Friday afternoon. The squall covered streets in up to 50 cm of accumulated hail, nearly burying several cars in one neighborhood, toppling trees and producing flooding across the Historic Center and the northwestern part of the state capital. Winds of up to 50 km/hr collapsed the roof of an auto dealership and a department store, knocked trees onto a housing project, blew over billboards and caused a power outage. City and state civil protection agents were out in force to survey the damage and assist the public in digging out from the hail drifts. Police rescued a young girl who was being swept away by floodwaters, but no casualties were reported. ⛈️Intensa tormenta de granizo en #Puebla 🚨Con este video de @Manatimx , la tormenta de esta tarde en #Puebla corresponde a un #Downburst ✅Es una corriente que desciende desde la nube a gran velocidad, trayendo abundante granizo y viento que puede superar los 80 km/h pic.twitter.com/7OXlVXAdXz — 🌲⛈️Meteorología México🌧️🌳 (@InfoMeteoro) May 24, 2024 On Sunday, strong winds knocked over tarpaulins at campaign events in two municipalities of México state, causing dozens of injuries. Meanwhile in Mexico City, capitalinos sweltered in the extreme heat all weekend. Sunday was the third consecutive day in which a record was set. The mercury hit 33.8 degrees Celsius (93 ̊F), which is a new all-time record for May 26. A day earlier, the temperature topped out at 34.7C, surpassing the all-time record set on May 9. Friday’s high also climbed above 34C, setting a new record for May 24. National Meteorological Service (SMN) data confirms that record-setting temperatures are likely to continue through June, the newspaper Debate reported on Sunday. Mexico’s current heat wave — the third of an expected five heat waves this season — has seen temperatures above 45 C in parts of the country. The Monday morning forecast from SMN warned that 19 states will experience extremely hot temperatures this week. Intense storms and high winds remain in the forecast for northern Mexico, where gale-force winds destroyed a stage at a political rally on Wednesday, killing nine people and injuring dozens. The temperatures up north are expected to ease slightly in the coming days, according to the weather site Meteored, but tropical humidity will arrive in its place. The emerging weather system will bring heavy rains in parts of central and southern Mexico, and states in the west and northwest should be prepared for extremely high winds.

        "content": "GAZA: The Zionist entity faced a wave of international condemnation Monday over a strike that killed at least 45 people when it set off a fire that ripped through a tent city for displaced Palestinians set up by Kuwaiti charities. Kuwait’s ministry of foreign affairs condemned on Monday the Zionist occupation’s aggression against displaced people. In a statement, the foreign ministry asserted that Zionist occupation’s actions against Palestinians exposes its blatant war crimes and unprecedented genocide to the whole world. This calls for immediate and firm intervention by the international community to compel these forces into adhering to international legitimacy resolutions, including International Court of Justice resolution on immediately ceasing aggression against Rafah and protecting the Palestinian people. The Zionist entity said it was looking into the “grave and awful” impact on civilians after the latest mass casualty event in the Gaza war. The Zionist military said Sunday evening’s attack in the southern Rafah area had targeted and killed two senior Hamas operatives - but it also sparked a fire that Palestinians and many Arab countries condemned as a massacre. A US National Security Council spokesperson said the Zionist entity “must take every precaution possible to protect civilians”. The UN Middle East envoy Tor Wennesland called on the Zionist entity to conduct a “thorough and transparent” investigation into the strike, as the Zionist military said it was launching a probe. UN human rights chief Volker Turk decried “horrific” images that “point to no apparent change in the methods and means of warfare used by (the Zionist entity) that have already led to so many civilian deaths”. French President Emmanuel Macron wrote on X that “these operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians.” EU foreign ministers agreed to call a meeting with the Zionist entity to get it to explain its actions in its Rafah offensive despite a UN court order to halt it, said the bloc’s top diplomat Josep Borrell, who called the strike “horrifying”. Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the government was investigating the “tragic accident” which he told parliament occurred “despite our best efforts” to protect civilians. Zionist government spokesman Avi Hyman earlier said: “It was definitely grave. Any loss of life, civilian live, is grave and is awful. We seek to go after Hamas and limit civilian casualties.” Relatives of captives held in Gaza, who have increased pressure on Netanyahu’s government demanding action to secure a captive release deal, heckled the premier from the public gallery as he was speaking and raised posters of their loved ones. The Zionist entity launched the attack on Rafah on Sunday evening, hours after Hamas unleashed a barrage of rockets at the Tel Aviv area, most of which were intercepted. The Zionist army said its aircraft “struck a Hamas compound in Rafah” and killed Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, senior officials for the militant group in the occupied West Bank. Gaza’s civil defense agency said the strike ignited a fire that tore through a displacement center in northwestern Rafah near a facility of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. “We saw charred bodies and dismembered limbs ... We also saw cases of amputations, wounded children, women and the elderly,” said civil defense agency official Mohammad Al-Mughayyir. “The sky suddenly lit up,” said displaced Palestinian Muhannad, an eyewitness. One survivor, a woman who declined to be named, said: “We heard a loud sound and there was fire all around us. The children were screaming.” Footage from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society showed chaotic nighttime scenes of paramedics racing to the attack site and evacuating the wounded. Mughayyir said the rescue efforts were hampered by war damage and the impacts of the Zionist entity’s siege. “There is a fuel shortage ... there are roads that have been destroyed” as well as “a shortage of water to extinguish fires”, he said. “We were praying...and we were getting our children’s beds ready to sleep. There was nothing unusual, then we heard a very loud noise, and fire erupted around us,” said Umm Mohamed Al-Attar, a Palestinian mother in a red headscarf. “All the children started screaming... The sound was terrifying; we felt like the metal was about to collapse on us, and shrapnel fell into the rooms.” Video footage obtained by Reuters showed a fire raging in the darkness and people screaming in panic. A group of young men tried to haul away sheets of corrugated iron and a hose from a single fire truck began to douse the flames. By daylight, the camp in Rafah was a smoking wreckage of tents, twisted metal and charred belongings. Women wept and men held prayers beside bodies in shrouds. Sitting beside bodies of his relatives, Abed Mohammed Al-Attar said the Zionist entity lied when it told residents they would be safe in Rafah’s western areas. His brother, sister-in-law and several other relatives were killed in the blaze. “The army is a liar. There is no security in Gaza. There is no security, not for a child, an elderly man, or a woman. Here he (my brother) is with his wife, they were martyred,” he said. The Zionist attack sparked strong regional protests from mediators Egypt and Qatar as well as from Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Egypt deplored the “targeting of defenseless civilians” and labelled it part of “a systematic policy aimed at widening the scope of death and destruction in the Gaza Strip to make it uninhabitable”. Jordan accused the Zionist entity of “ongoing war crimes”, Saudi Arabia condemned “the continued massacres”, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed “to hold these barbarians and murderers accountable”. Qatar condemned a “dangerous violation of international law” and voiced “concern that the bombing will complicate ongoing mediation efforts” towards a truce. The African Union chair Moussa Faki Mahamat also condemned the attack on X saying: “(The Zionist entity) continues to violate international law with impunity and in contempt of an ICJ ruling two days ago ordering an end to its military action in Rafah.” The top world court, the International Court of Justice, on Friday ordered the Zionist entity to halt any offensive in Rafah and elsewhere that could bring about “the physical destruction” of the Palestinians. The Zionist offensive has killed at least 36,050 people in Gaza, mostly women and children. Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA which has been central to aid operations in the besieged territory during the war, said on X that “with every day passing, providing assistance & protection becomes nearly impossible”. “The images from last night are testament to how Rafah has turned into hell on Earth,” he said, with “heavy movement restrictions”, ongoing Zionist strikes and Hamas rocket launches, and other “challenges ... that do not allow us to distribute aid”. On Tuesday, Spain, Ireland and Norway are due to formally recognize a Palestinian state — a step so far taken by more than 140 UN members but few Western powers. The Zionist entity opposes the move and on Monday announced punitive steps against Madrid, ordering its consulate in Jerusalem to stop offering services to Palestinians from June 1. - Agencies",

Formentera in the Balearics is famed for being \"one of the jewels of Spain\" with its wonderful beaches, pretty villages and breath-taking views. But with tourist saturation currently the buzz word in numerous other holiday locations, including neighbouring Majorca and Ibiza, the local council is taking no chances with Formentera's reputation. function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) Formentera council has issued a bulletin reminding visitors of the need to register their vehicles on Formentera.eco to be able to take them to the island between June 1st and September 30th of this year. \"Formentera wants to continue being the most paradisiacal destination in Spain, a place where rest is just that, rest, and where nothing reminds us of the saturation of large cities or where going from one point to another on the island becomes an odyssey,\" the council said in a statement. To achieve this objective, Formentera has a fundamental tool, which it has called Formentera.eco. This is the application of Law 7/2019 for the environmental and economic sustainability of the island, which regulates the entry and circulation of vehicles during the high season with the aim of protecting the environment and being able to offer, in this way, \" the paradise island\" that visitors deserve. Formentera.eco comes into force on June 1st and ends on September 30th. During these dates, visitors who want to enter Formentera with their car or motorcycle have to register it in advance and obtain authorisation to circulate on the island, since the number of vehicles that can enter from outside the island is limited. Furthermore, once you obtain authorisation on the website https://formentera.eco/es, to be able to enter the island with your vehicle you must pay a fee. The rate for tourism for the months of June and September will be six euros per day, with a minimum amount of 30 euros, while the rate for motorcycles will be three euros per day, with a minimum amount of 15 euros. As for the months of July and August, the amount for tourism will be nine euros per day, with a minimum amount of 45 euros, while for motorcycles the price will be 4.5 euros per day with a minimum amount of 22.50 euros. Formentera council is also stressing that access to the island by quads, caravans or campers is totally prohibited, since camping is not allowed on the island. Rental vehicles from outside the island cannot access Formentera either. Failure to comply with the specifications of Formentera.eco can lead to significant financial penalties, ranging from 1,000 euros to 10,000, in the most serious cases, according to the island's executive. Trending In order to correctly carry out this control to avoid saturation of the island's roads in the summer season and thus be able to provide a better experience to tourists who visit the island, Formentera has a system of video cameras for traffic control that automatically detect vehicles that have not been registered and automatically makes the penalty proposal. This camera system is complemented by the actions of the local police and regulated parking service controllers, who constantly monitor vehicle licence plates to prevent unauthorised circulation.

        "description": "A victory for the Labour Party would give the opportunity to rebuild relations between Belfast and London after a difficult period",
        "content": "The UK general election scheduled for July 4th is a welcome opportunity to hit the reset button between political parties in Northern Ireland and Westminster. Since the Brexit vote on June 23rd, 2016, relations between the Conservative government and the North’s main parties have been strained, for a variety of reasons. The Tories played a cynical game with Northern Ireland during Brexit negotiations. Boris Johnson, the former prime minister, gave a pledge to unionists that he would never accept a border between Britain and Northern Ireland, before he signed a deal in October 2019 to put customs and regulatory checks down the Irish Sea. Overall, Brexit has been a source of significant instability, which is underlined by the fact that the Stormont government was shuttered for a total of five years on two separate occasions since the 2016 vote. READ MORE Temu: What is it, how do I pronounce it, and why is it so cheap? Ken Early: Manchester United face a choice over Erik ten Hag, but not a difficult one Coleen Nolan: ‘I haven’t had two failed marriages, I’ve had two amazing marriages, because they gave me amazing children’ Una Mullally: Jennifer Zamparelli would have been worth fighting for. But if The 2 Johnnies ‘were never ours’, why hire them? The Conservative Party has carried its lack of consideration for Northern Ireland onto the campaign trail. It has said that its idea of introducing mandatory national service for 18-year olds will include Northern Ireland. Suggesting that people from a nationalist background sign up for the British army shows an astonishing lack of sensitivity. According to all credible polls, the Labour Party will win a thumping majority on July 4th. Hilary Benn, who is the shadow secretary of state for Northern Ireland, has shown a willingness to engage with both communities, and the growing non-aligned middle ground. Labour would not reverse the Brexit vote, but it would take a much more constructive approach to relations with the EU. That would be a positive development for the outworking of the Windsor Framework, which gives Northern Ireland access to the UK internal market and the EU’s single market for goods. It is going to be a difficult election for the DUP amid the ongoing legal woes of Jeffrey Donaldson, the former party leade r, who is facing allegations of historical sex abuse. Underlining this, the news that Alliance party leader Naomi Long will contest the Belfast East constituency poses a significant challenge for Gavin Robinson, the interim leader of the DUP, to retain his seat. The splintered unionist vote means Sinn Féin appears poised to return the highest number of MPs in the July election. This would make Sinn Féin the biggest party at local council, in the Stormont Assembly and Westminster – a remarkable milestone. There are no indications that Sinn Féin will reverse its policy of abstentionism. Nevertheless, it would need to develop a good working relationship with Labour. The same applies to the DUP and the North’s other political parties. Political stasis in recent years has taken its toll on public services. The people of Northern Ireland deserve better. A Labour government presents the opportunity for a fresh start.",

Her mugshot for the May 20 DUI Shocking new video shows a police officer emptying bottle after bottle of Fireball whiskey out of Kathryn Dennis's Louis Vuitton dog bag after officers seized it following her arrest for causing a three-vehicle-collision last week. In a cache of new footage, obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com, the former Southern Charm belle can also be seen flunking her field sobriety test earlier that evening – wobbling shoeless in the headlights of the patrol car called to the scene. Dennis, 32, was arrested and charged with being drunk at the wheel and transporting alcohol in open containers when she smashed into the back of a car as it slowed to a stop at a red traffic signal about 9.15pm last Monday. That car in turn hit the car in front of it. Last week bodycam footage emerged of Dennis sobbing in the back of a police car as she was transported by officers of Goose Creek Police Department to Berkley County Detention Center in Monck's Corner, South Carolina. Now, DailyMail.com can reveal new details of that journey, of Dennis's erratic behavior and of the chaotic events that preceded it. The former Southern Charm belle can be seen flunking her field sobriety test - wobbling, shoeless, in the headlights of the patrol car called to the scene New video shows a police officer emptying bottles of Fireball whiskey out of Dennis's Louis Vuitton dog bag after her DUI arrest In the video, the officer takes the Fireball bottles out of the bag one by one, before coming across a single can of Coke. He eventually throws them all in the trash. According to the incident report obtained by DailyMail.com, the first officer to speak to Dennis observed her 'glossy eyes' and 'the odor of alcohol emanating from [her] person.' The officer also noted 'an unopened bottle of Fireball on the driver's side floorboard' and a 'pink tumbler cup in the center console which was empty'. The officer noted that Dennis refused a breathalyzer test but agreed to undergo a field sobriety test. Captured by the dashcam video of his patrol car the extent to which Dennis flunked the test is painfully evident. According to his report the first test the officer carried out was the 'Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test,' in which a person is asked to track an officer's finger while the cop looks for the tell-tale involuntary eye jerking which happens when someone under the influence of drugs or alcohol looks to the side. As well as smelling the alcohol on Dennis, the officer noted four out of six clues suggesting intoxication while conducting the test including a 'lack of smooth pursuit' on Dennis's part. The next test was a walk and turn for which she chose to remove her sandals. Here the officer noted she could not even keep her balance while standing in the starting position, used her arms and hands for balance as she walked and missed the heel to toe requirement of the walk on numerous occasions. She was also unable to balance on one leg without wind-milling her arms to keep her balance. Later, oblivious to her performance, Dennis can be heard telling herself: 'I passed that f***ing field sobriety test. This is some b******t. Like, I literally am not drunk.' Dennis was traveling with her golden doodle puppy 'Lil Gucci' whom she had placed in the back of the police patrol vehicle during these tests Videos show the reality star handcuffed after failing sobriety tests. She tells the cops: Y'all are ruining my life' Dennis was traveling with her golden doodle puppy 'Lil Gucci' whom she had placed in the back of the police patrol vehicle during these tests. When officers searched the pup's dog carrier they found, 'several mini bottles of Fireball, some of which were opened and empty.' Indeed, footage of the search of that bag as she was booked into Berkley County Detention Center some hours later shows an officer removing at least ten miniature bottles from the bag – some are empty, some are open and appear half empty, others are full and still bound together by the plastic wrap of the multipack in which they were bought. Read More EXCLUSIVE Southern Charm's Kathryn Dennis's car is seen speeding through a school zone before hitting officer and knocking stop sign out of her hand in hit-and-run incident - months before DUI arrest Patrol car footage of the drive from the scene to the detention center reviewed by DailyMail.com shows Dennis running the emotional gamut in attempts to derail the due process of her arrest. At times she pleads, at others she wails in fury at being separated from her 'child' by which she means her dog. At some points she threatens the officers with legal action, saying she will 'ruin' them, at others she attempts to chat more calmly and elicit sympathy. When she sobs her tears appear to be out of frustration and anger that none of her tactics have any impact on the cops. She accuses the officer of touching her inappropriately as he reaches across her to fasten her safety-belt across her lap while her hands are cuffed behind her back. She then accuses the officer of trying to 'gaslight' her 'like my ex.' Dennis's tumultuous relationship with disgraced former congressman Thomas Ravenel which resulted in two children and ended in 2018 when he was hit with sexual assault charges by three women , was the predominant plotline or her eight seasons with Bravo reality show, Southern Charm. The reality star was also booked for driving with an open container Dennis's tumultuous relationship with disgraced former congress man Thomas Ravenel ended in 2018. They share son St. Julien Rembert, eight, and daughter Kensington Calhoun, 10 At one point during her transportation to the detention center Dennis pleads for leniency from the officer arresting her saying, 'I'm going to lose custody of my children, please!' But Dennis lost custody of Kensington 'Kensie' Calhoun, 9, and St. Julien 'Saint' Rembert, 7, to their father following a protracted and bitter custody battle as she repeatedly failed the court-mandated drug testing on which her rights to her children depended. She now has supervised visitation with them every other Saturday and Sunday. At another point she says, 'I'm never going to get my kids back. Thanks guys. There's literally no reason for me to be here. So congratulations it's f***ing b******t.' Vacillating wildly, Dennis seems lucid at times, before lurching into a rage and threatening the officers, 'I will f***ing ruin you,' when they explain her dog will be taken into a pound until someone can come and collect him. Later, in a moment of apparent resignation and exhaustion she says, 'There's no way to go back now is there?' Dennis was booked into Berkely Detention Center Monday night where she was held before being released on bond. Her bond was set at $1,199.50 for the DUI and $257.70 for transporting an open container of alcohol in a motor vehicle.

        "content": "The ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) has declared a resounding victory in the Capital, Provincial, City and District Council elections for the fourth mandate. Chhim Phalvorun, a spokesman for the CPP, said yesterday that the party won the majority of votes in the elections. “Our party agents are collecting the data, and we are waiting for the official results issued by the NEC, and then we can analyse it,” Phalvorun said. The official results of the Council Election will be announced on June 8. Five political parties— the CPP, the Khmer Will Party, the Nation Power Party, Funcinpec and the Khmer National United Party, contested the non-universal suffrage elections. Kong Monika, Secretary-General of the Khmer Will Party, said that the party lost some votes for two reasons: firstly, it was slow to garner support from some commune councillors of the Candlelight Party and secondly, local authorities arrested commune councillors who were voters. The KWP replaced Candlelight Party which was disqualified to run the elections. Monika added that the results of the Capital, Provincial, City, and District Council elections on Sunday were not different from the Senate Election earlier this year. “Based on the votes in each constituency, the Khmer Will Party can get between 40 and 50 seats for the Capital and Provincial Councils, and more than 300 seats for the City, and District councils,” he said. The CPP obtained 9,376 council seats (1,648 commune chiefs, 1,618 first deputy and 261 second deputy positions) during the June 5, 2022 commune elections. Candlelight Party has 2,198 councillors (four commune chiefs, 25 first deputy and 1,360 second deputy posts), Funcinpec has 19 commune councillors and Khmer National United Party has 13. NECs Chairman Prach Chan said that 11,598 sitting commune chiefs and councilors, or 99.79% of the 11,622 eligible voters, cast their ballots for 4,200 capital, provincial, city and district councillors on Sunday. “The elections were conducted smoothly with good security and order, and without any violence or intimidation,” Chan said. He said that the council elections were held in a free and fair manner based on the principle of liberal multi-party democracy. CPP won all the votes in Pursat, Kep, Pailin and Mondulkiri provinces. In general, nationwide most of the votes went to the CPP, followed by KWP, and KPP. Based on the preliminary results in Phnom Penh, the CPP received 813 votes, the KWP received 80 and the National Power Party got one. In Battambang province, the CPP received 711 votes, the KWP garnered 100 votes and the KPP got 11. In Siem Reap, the CPP received 541 votes, KPP (90), the KWP (35) and the Khmer United National Party obtained one vote. In Prey Veng province, the CPP received 737 votes, the KWP got 140, the KPP had six, while Funcinpec and the Khmer United National Party obtained one vote each. The Capital, provincial, city and district council elections are held once every five years. Only commune councillors are eligible to vote. The third Council Election was held on May 26, 2019. Seven political parties had contested the elections.",

        "content": "Listen to Story Young star Varvara Gracheva pulled out of the early upsets of the French Open 2024 as she eliminated Maria Sakkari in the first round of the competition on May 27, Monday to move to the second round. Buoyed by the support from the home crowd, Gracheva secured a comeback win over the Greek star with the scoreline reading 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 as the match ended in just over 2 hours and 10 minutes. Sakkari, who was looking to make amends for her poor showing in the Australian Open, had a shaky start as Gracheva was able to break her in the very first game. However, Sakkari was able to return the favour in the next one as she was slowy able to gain control over things and took a 4-2 lead by breaking the 23-year-old French star. The duo would then go on lose while serving, before Sakkari finally pulled away and secured the first set 6-3. Gracheva would find her groove in the second set and was finally able to break Sakkari to take the lead and extend it to 4-1. Sakkari, however, would mount a comeback of her own and levelled the score at 4-4 as the odds were in favour of the 6th seed at that point. However, the French star was able to get a grip of proceedings and won the next two games to make the game 1-1 and pushing it into the decider. The third set saw both women push each other in the early goings with the score level at 2-2. Gracheva was able to take the lead from the serve and then both women had an incredible back and forth in the next game. It seemed like the Greek star would be able to level things up before Gracheva used the encouragement from the crowd to gain the advantage and secure the break point. The next serve saw Gracheva on the verge of securing the win with the score at 5-2, before Sakkari dug deep to save a couple of match points and get the game. However, it wasn't able to start a revival for the 6th seed as Gracheva secured a memorable win to progress to the next round.",

        "content": "CHICAGO (AP) — A Chicago man convicted of murder based in part on testimony from a legally blind eyewitness is suing the city and the police department. A judge convicted Darien Harris in 2014 in connection with a fatal shooting at a South Side gas station in 2011. He was 12 years into a 76-year prison sentence when he was freed in December after The Exoneration Project showed that the eyewitness had advanced glaucoma and lied about his eyesight issues. Harris was 30 years old when he went free. Harris filed a federal civil rights lawsuit in April alleging police fabricated evidence and coerced witnesses into making false statements, the Chicago Tribune reported Monday. He told the newspaper that he is still struggling to put his life back together. “I don’t have any financial help. I’m still (treated like) a felon, so I can’t get a good job. It’s hard for me to get into school,” he said. “I’ve been so lost. ... I feel like they took a piece of me that is hard for me to get back.” A message The Associated Press left on the city's Law Department main line seeking comment Monday wasn't immediately returned. The department provides attorneys for the city, its departments and its employees. Harris was an 18-year-old high school senior when he was arrested. The legally blind eyewitness picked Harris out of a police lineup and identified him in court. The eyewitness testified that he was riding his motorized scooter near the gas station when he heard gunshots and saw a person aiming a handgun. He also added that the shooter bumped into him. Harris’ trial attorney asked the witness if his diabetes affected his vision. He said yes but denied he had vision problems. But the man’s doctor deemed him legally blind nine years before the incident, court records show. A gas station attendant also testified that Harris wasn't the shooter. The Exoneration Project has helped clear more than 200 people since 2009, including a dozen in Chicago's Cook County in 2023 alone.",

        "content": "As the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) commences Continuous Voter Registration today (Monday), it’s notable that a substantial number of Permanent Voter Cards, totaling at least 635,011, are still awaiting collection by registered voters in Edo and Ondo states. INEC’s latest data reveals that Edo State has 373,030 uncollected PVCs, while Ondo State has 261,981 PVCs yet to be claimed. This update coincides with the commencement of the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) process in both states. Edo State is gearing up for its governorship election slated for September 21, 2024, while Ondo State is preparing for its election on November 16, 2024. INEC has announced that the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise will take place from Monday, May 27, to Wednesday, June 5. The registration will run from 9 am to 3 pm daily, including weekends, to ensure accessibility for voters before the elections. Additionally, uncollected PVCs will be available for collection during this period. INEC officials and corps members will facilitate the exercise across 397 walk-in registration centers, ward levels, and state headquarters to ensure accessibility and efficiency. During a recent stakeholders meeting, INEC Chairman Mahmood Yakubu emphasized provisions enabling registered voters to transfer their registration from other states to Edo and Ondo, as well as relocate their voting credentials within the two states. Yakubu explained that these measures were designed to streamline the process and encourage maximum participation in the forthcoming elections. This initiative aims to address time constraints and ensure a more inclusive registration process. In an interview on Sunday, the Chief Press Secretary to the INEC Chairman, Rotimi Oyekanmi, expressed confidence in the smooth conduct of the CVR and encouraged registered voters to retrieve their PVCs. He said, “We encourage all eligible individuals to utilize this CVR window to exercise their right to vote. We are committed to ensuring a seamless process.”",

        "content": "The Nigerian Army, on Monday, confirmed the immediate reopening of the popular Abuja Banex Plaza following an understanding between the authorities, plaza management and traders’ association. The plaza had been shut for over a week following a mob attack on some personnel of the Nigerian army by unidentified hoodlums on May 18. This is contained in a statement by the Director, Army Public Relations, Maj.-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, on Monday in Abuja. Nwachucku said a high-level meeting was convened in the Office of the National Security Adviser including the Principal General Staff Officer to the NSA, Commissioner of Police FCT and the FCT Director of the Department of State Services. Others on the panel, according to him are the Leadership and Management of Banex Plaza, a Representative from the Directorate of Abuja Environmental Protection Board, and the National Chairman of the Mobile Phone Traders Association. He said the primary objective of the meeting was to identify and apprehend the perpetrators and ensure the continued security of the Federal Capital Territory. “The following resolutions were agreed upon: Immediate reopening of Banex Plaza to the public and the leadership of Banex Plaza is instructed to lock up Shop C93 with immediate effect. “The owners of the shop who orchestrated the mob attack on the soldiers are to be arrested and handed over to the Nigerian Police. “Market leaders are to remain vigilant and report any remaining perpetrators to the authorities. “Furthermore, the two individuals already arrested have been handed over to the headquarters of the Nigerian Army Corps of Military Police for further action. “The Nigerian army will also thoroughly investigate the circumstances surrounding the presence of its personnel at the plaza and the subsequent attack,” he said. Nwachukwu reiterated that acts of violence against military personnel were not only condemnable but also pose a significant threat to national security and public order. He urged members of the public to exercise caution and restraint when interacting with military personnel and other security operatives, especially when they are in uniform. According to him, there are established channels for reporting grievances or misconduct by personnel to the appropriate authorities. “It is imperative that these channels are utilized to maintain order and respect for those who serve and protect our nation. “The Nigerian army remains committed to ensuring safety and security of all citizens and will continue to work diligently to prevent such incidents in the future,” he added.

        "content": "A digital endoscope used in colonoscopy. (iStock / Getty Images) DEAR MAYO CLINIC : I just turned 45 and am dreading my first colonoscopy. Why do I need to be screened if I’m not having issues? Can you walk me through the process? ANSWER : Feeling anxious or afraid surrounding a procedure, particularly when you’ve never done it before, is completely normal. The purpose of screening is to act before someone develops symptoms. If we’re able to identify polyps , which are precancerous lesions in the lining of the colon, we would then have the opportunity to remove them and prevent the development of cancer in the first place. So through screening, we can prevent cancer. At the time of diagnosing cancer, we’ve missed that opportunity. There are a number of ways we can screen for colorectal cancer . In the U.S., we most often use a colonoscopy . A colonoscopy is an invasive test, but it allows us an opportunity to not only see polyps, but also remove them at the same time. For people with no additional risk factors besides age, it is recommended to start screening at the age of 45. If other risk factors are present, though, it may be recommended to have a colonoscopy sooner than 45. The colon preparation prior to the colonoscopy is key. The goal of colonoscopy prep is to make sure that there is nothing in the colon by using a laxative liquid solution. Then, at the time of the colonoscopy, we’re able to see and detect even small precancerous lesions so they can be removed. It is very common to hear complaints from patients about the preparation, such as the consistency or taste of the solution, cramping, abdominal bloating or discomfort. That’s to be anticipated. Unfortunately, some patients also experience nausea. Try slowing down how fast you are drinking the solution. For those who tend to struggle with the taste or consistency, try drinking it through a straw. You can also bite into a small wedge of lime or lemon, or you can chew gum or ice between drinks. After you finish the last of the prep solution and check in for your appointment, you’ll often be greeted by the front desk team and then escorted back by a healthcare team member. They will review things like your medical history and medications and see how the colon prep treated you. There is a risk that you may have to come back and repeat the test at a later time if the colon prep was not adequate. Another critical thing they will do is establish your intravenous therapy or IV. The IV is the route in which they will give you the medication to help make the procedure a little bit more comfortable. Some people don’t do any sedation at all, but it is totally appropriate to opt for it. There are several different ways that sedation could be done for the procedure. A lot of that depends upon how the procedure is scheduled with your health care team. Then, you will end up going back to the procedure room where they will review the nature of the procedure before starting the colonoscopy. Afterward, there’s a bit of a recovery period, and then you’re able to head back home. Because of the sedation, we don’t want people driving, consuming alcohol or making any critical decisions for 24 hours. We still don’t have a perfect recipe for preventing polyps, but maintaining a healthy diet and exercise can protect you. It is important to be aware of any symptoms and then follow through with screening. Best of luck as you take this important first step. — Derek Ebner, M.D ., Gastroenterology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.
