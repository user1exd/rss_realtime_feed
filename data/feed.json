The province went on to say that prefabricated designs are a quicker way to bring more services such as schools to growing communities. 2:20 Six hundred new child care spaces being created at schools across Central Okanagan This addition is on top of the five new prefabricated classrooms under construction at North Glenmore Elementary school that will be ready for students in fall 2024.

        "content": "BRITAIN'S Got Talent fans were left seriously distracted during the very first live semi-final show. Tonight Britain's Got Talent returned for the first live shows of the series as the first group of acts competed for a place in the final. 3 Amanda left fans seriously distracted with her daring look Credit: ITV 3 She looked incredible in the red leather dress which had a thigh-high split Credit: Shutterstock 3 She was joined by fellow judges Simon, Alesha and Bruno Credit: Shutterstock Judges Amanda Holden, Simon Cowell, Alesha Dixon and Bruno Tonioli were back, along with hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly. As always the judges put on a glamourous display and Amanda, 53, looked incredible in an off the shoulder red leather dress with a daring thigh-high split. The presenter went braless for the look, and viewers were distracted when Amanda spoke to new dad Ant and co-host Dec, both 48, at the start of the show. Taking to social media, one wrote: \"Bit nippy, Amanda?\" Another said: \"Amanda could cut glass tonight.\" And a third joked: \"Does Amanda own a bra?\" It comes after Amanda admitted she thought she'd be fired when daughter Hollie, 12, stormed the panel with 64-year-old Simon's son Eric, 10, to send Japanese double dutch dancers Haribow through with the Golden Buzzer. Sharing the clip on Instagram, Amanda later wrote: \"I mean ... I thought I was going to get fired as it was so unexpected my #HRH & Eric x even @simoncowell was wobbled but they have the first ever audience GOLDEN BUZZER\" Most read in TV BALOGUN'S BACK Rangers star Leon Balogun signs new one-year contract GER HUNGARY Rangers 'in advanced talks' to sign winger who helped shock Real Madrid TOO FAR Inside Celtic star Greg Taylor's cup final spat with Rangers hero Todd Cantwell EUR ON Gers handed Champions League qualifying boost as Hearts discover Europa League fate The moment came after Haribow received a standing ovation from the audience and roaring pleas for them to get a golden buzzer, despite all the judges already using theirs. Until this game-changing moment, Ant and Dec, plus each of the judges were allowed only one per series. BGT fans hit out at major Simon Cowell change they say has 'ruined the show' Britain's Got Talent's biggest 'fix' rows Britain's Got Talent has been plagued with 'fix' rows over the years. How many of these do you remember? Jasmine Elcock - 2016: Teenage singer Jasmine Elcock stunned the nation with her version of Cher's Believe. But it then transpired she had already performed professionally in London's West End. Jasmine, 14, admitted: \"I’ve performed in Annie in the West End at about the age of nine or 10, but I really get nervous.\" IrShad Shaikh - 2017: BGT fans were left questioning the rule book when IrShad Shaikh auditioned. He got four red buzzers from the judges, which would usually mean an instant dismissal. Yet in a strange turn of events, they let him continue with his act...and put him through to the next round. Colin Thackery - 2019: Elderly war veteran Colin won BGT in 2019, but there was an outcry over the final. He warbled his place to win with a version of We'll Meet Again but fans were furious that escapologist Jonathan Goodwin didn't even rank in the top three. Viewers felt Jonathan - who almost suffocated while being buried alive in a gravel pit - should have won. Axel Blake - 2022: Comedian Axel Blake was given a Golden Buzzer in 2022 after making the judges laugh. But fans were fuming when they discovered Axel already had a show on worldwide streaming platform Amazon Prime. Despite this, Axel still went on to win the series. Loren Allred - 2022: The 2022 series of BGT was hit with another controversy when singer Loren Allred also received a Golden Buzzer. She performed Never Enough from the smash hit musical movie The Greatest Showman and got a standing ovation. It later transpired Loren was actually the original voice behind the track. Taryn Charles - 2024: Singer Taryn Charles is one of this year's hopefuls lucky enough to receive the Golden Buzzer. Bruno Tonilio put her straight through to the semi-finals following her performance of (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman by Aretha Franklin , but it has now come to light that she is no stranger to TV. Viewers recognised Taryn from an episode of ITV1's Starstruck, where she impersonated Whitney Houston for judges Olly Murs, Sheridan Smith , Adam Lambert and Beverley Knight.",

After nine incredible years at the club, the time has come for me to turn a new page in my career. “Since I arrived in 2015, I have had the immense honour of wearing this shirt and playing in front of you, the best supporters in the world! You have been an unwavering support, through the good times and the difficult. “Your passion and loyalty have been a constant source of motivation for me. “I’d like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you’ve done for me. Your songs, your encouragement and your love for the club are memories that will remain engraved in my heart forever. “I would also like to express my gratitude to all my team-mates, technical staff and all the members of the club I have met during my nine years here. I am proud to have been able to share these experiences with you. “Manchester United will always be in my heart. This club has left its mark on my career and offered me an incredible opportunity to play in front of you. “I’m leaving to take on new challenges, I’ll always be a Red Devil and I’ll continue to follow the club’s results with passion. “Thank you again for everything and see you soon. With all my affection, Anthony Martial.” During his time in England, Martial has won the Carabao Cup, the FA Cup and the Europa League, but has struggled for consistency and slipped out of the reckoning under current boss Erik ten Hag. In 2019 during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s reign, he signed a contract up until this summer with the option of a further 12 months.",

        "content": "VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran's attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to have economic sanctions imposed over the country's controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing the program down. The program — as all matters of state in Iran — are under the guidance of Iran’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and that likely won’t change in the wake of last week's helicopter crash that killed Iran's president and foreign minister. The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency also comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Israel and Iran have carried out direct strikes on each other’s territory for the first time last month. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said that as of May 11, Iran has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report by the U.N. watchdog in February . Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Also as of May 11, the report says Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6,201.3 kilograms (1,3671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1,489.8 pounds) since the IAEA's previous report. IAEA’s definition says that around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further, to 90%. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi , has previously warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the U.N. agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. Under the original nuclear deal, struck in 2015, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. The 2015 deal saw Tehran agree to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for generating nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At the time, U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. Monday's report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar IAEA inspectors from further monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.” According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran's decision to bar inspectors — and a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.” The deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA's talks with Tehran over improving cooperation, the report acknowledged. Before the May 19 helicopter crash, Iran had agreed to hold technical negotiations with IAEA on May 20, following a visit by Grossi earlier in the month. But those meetings fell apart due to the crash. Iran then sent a letter on May 21, saying its nuclear team wants to continue discussions in Tehran \"on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon,” the report said. The report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA's years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. It said the IAEA’s request need to be resolved, otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations\" under a safeguards agreement between Tehran and the nuclear watchdog. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA said that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.”",

WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition.

Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Autodesk, Inc. lacked adequate internal controls as a result of issues with its free cash flow and non-GAAP operating margin practices; and (2) as a result, defendants' statements about its business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

        "description": "Yes, her dad’s Ethan Hawke and her mum’s Uma Thurman. But Maya Hawke is creating thoughtful work on her own terms – including her new album, Chaos Angel.",
        "content": "On a highway somewhere between Atlanta and South Carolina, Maya Hawke is enjoying a brief respite from armageddon. She’s been given a few days off from shooting the final season of Stranger Things , the Netflix hit where she plays the loveable, neurotic video shop clerk Robin Buckley, and the 25-year-old has decided to break up the grind of the lengthy shoot – “We started in January, and we’ll probably be done in January. It’s a marathon, not a sprint,” she deadpans – with an impromptu road trip. By the time she phones through for our scheduled interview, she’s already singing the classics. “We’ve been listening to a podcast on the history of the French Revolution and Napoleon Bonaparte,” she says with a dry laugh, when I ask her for the road trip’s playlist. It’s not Sabrina Carpenter and it’s not the Beatles’ Black Album , the famous mixtape her dad Ethan Hawke once curated for her and later repurposed for his role in Richard Linklater’s Boyhood , but it feels delightfully on brand for the most cerebral of Gen-Z’s rising screen stars. “I remember it all pretty well from grade school,” Hawke adds. “I can sing along if I try really hard, shouting out Bastille Day, really vibing with it.” Beyond the screen, Hawke – the daughter of Ethan and Uma Thurman, who, besides Stranger Things , earned acclaim for her recent performances in Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City and Bradley Cooper’s Maestro – is gearing up for the release of Chaos Angel , her third album of thoughtful indie-pop following Blush (2020) and Moss (2022), albums which, while sonically sparse, showcased her sensitive, expressive songwriting. If Moss was her musical unveiling, particularly via its breakout single Therese , inspired by modern artist Balthus’ Therese Dreaming , Chaos Angel , elevates her work further, both with its sonic ambition and an increasing boldness in her songwriting. Take the lead single Missing Out , for example, where Hawke sings about naive kids envying her “television salary” and her own conflicted feelings about “being born with my foot in the door”, as though she’s grappling with the privilege of how she grew up while also wondering if she lost something along the way. “I don’t see Missing Out as any more revealing than any of my other songs, but it’s possible it’s revealing aspects of my thinking that are more salacious to people in, like, a kind of headliney way,” Hawke concedes, perhaps a weary glare to the nepo narrative that’s become every Hollywood scion’s burden. The song was inspired by Hawke’s misgivings about having skipped college at 18 in order to live on her own and pursue acting opportunities instead. The decision left her feeling so alienated among her own generation that years later, she tagged onto her brother Levon’s experience at Brown University, where she dropped in on random lectures on the history of Hinduism, Eastern religion, and the history of China for three months. “Yes, there was a poetic irony to it,” Hawke says, when I suggest most uni kids are trying to get out of class, not get into ones they aren’t even enrolled in. “But it was so fun and so enlightening. I got to sneak into classes and listen to professors talk, and I’m grateful to my brother for allowing me to do that and to talk about it publicly, because both things are slightly embarrassing for him.” By the time summer break came around, Hawke had found perspective. “I was like, you know what? I like my life. I don’t have any regrets. But I wrote a song about it, so not a total waste of time.” It’s a strange thing to admit to an interview subject that you might have inadvertently stalked them years ago, when they were merely a child clutching their famous father’s hand during a leisurely stroll around their home neighbourhood, but here we are. It was over a decade ago, I tell Hawke, and my girlfriend and I were tourists in New York, on our way to explore Chelsea’s recently opened High Line, when we stumbled across Ethan Hawke in the streets with kids in tow. Obviously, we did what any Before Sunrise enthusiast would do and surreptitiously walked in the same direction for a string of blocks to see what exciting movie star business he was getting up to. About 10 minutes later, we gave up out of both shame and boredom. What was surprising, however, was the space and respect his fellow New Yorkers afforded Hawke. He might have attracted the odd head turn, but no one bothered him – just a dude taking a walk with his family. You sense that even with two Hollywood superstars for parents, Maya’s childhood was decidedly sheltered from typical movie star eccentricities. “One thing that’s wonderful about my parents is that they never had an overblown sense of their own importance,” says Hawke. “They felt like artists, in that their relationship to their work was not as celebrities or famous people, but as people whose job it was to make art. And so they acted like anyone would with that; they just saw it as their job. That’s what I was brought up around, an understanding that a life in the arts is a job and it’s a craft. It’s a beautiful privilege to have that job, but it’s also a job like everyone else’s and it’s not more or less important than anyone else’s.” Growing up in such an environment, a life in the arts was always likely. “My whole life was drowned in the arts,” says Hawke. “I did every school play, I was always writing songs, I was always doing watercolours, I was always writing poems. Being in New York City, we’d go to the Met, the theatre, see plays on Broadway, things off-Broadway. It just felt like a necessary part of life – you eat, you sleep, you try to move your body, you try to go to school, and you try to consume a little art and make a little art, too.” In an interview with Variety , Ethan once mentioned he knew the exact moment Maya would follow in her parents’ footsteps, after he brought her along to a technical read through of a Shakespeare play he was in, and was shocked to find she wasn’t bored at all. But when does Maya pinpoint her professional awakening? “It was doing Euripides’ Bacchae in my junior year, directed by Laura Barnett, at my high school Saint Ann’s in Brooklyn,” she says. “I dove into it completely. I didn’t study for my SAT, I didn’t focus on anything else, I just let myself be an actor and it was the best feeling I’d ever had. It felt like I was home, I loved the community, I loved the friendships I made. That experience, and how positive it was, became kind of like the golden compass, alethiometer, of my life. I was like, OK, I’m gonna chase that feeling.” Music was a similarly organic pursuit, fuelled by childhood guitar, piano and singing lessons, and the realisation that songwriting was a prime form of communication that persuaded the people around her to listen more. “I’m still this kind of person who practises for my conversations. Like, if we were roommates and we were gonna have a big talk about the fact that you don’t do the dishes enough, I would practise that conversation in my head a lot, and I would find that putting melodies to my rehearsed conversations and making them rhyme was a better way to remember them.” Negative preconceptions about actors who make music are prevalent, and Hawke hasn’t been immune. She credits her producer and co-writer Christian Lee Hutson (to whom she’s also been romantically linked ) for being “a huge influence in shirking some of the imposter syndrome, though I still have a lot”. “I still have imposter syndrome but it’s gotten a lot better,” says Hawke. “On my first record I really felt like I had to keep the songs completely bare, like only use acoustic instruments and not double my vocal or have any harmonies because I didn’t want anyone to think that I had, you know, ‘bought a record’ – like, hired a producer to make me sound good. If they didn’t like me, I wanted to make sure they knew that they didn’t like me and not that they didn’t like the choices somebody else had made. “But I think each record has gotten less constrained by my fear and more playful and more present, and I think it’s just from education. The more you learn, the less afraid you are. Knowledge is power.” Her confidence is present on Chaos Angel, a warm album that’s more sonically layered than Hawke’s others, with its use of samples, horns, electronics and distortion, inspired by artists she was listening to at the time including Liz Phair, Mazzy Star, Buffy Sainte-Marie, James Blake, and our own Julia Jacklin. “About my first few records, people kept writing that they were sparse,” she says. “And I definitely had a goal to have no one say that this was sparse.” The song Dark , which she’s said “emerged from a major anxiety episode following a soul-shattering break-up”, highlights Hawke’s way with a good line (“I’m your guitar, mute me gently with the palm of your hand”). You can imagine the Notes app on her phone is loaded. “It’s very chaotic,” Hawke admits. “I like to play this game called ‘Notes Roulette’, where you and another person pick a date and you scroll through your phone to find the note you made on that day and you have to read it out loud. Fun game, I highly recommend it,” she adds. “Nothing’s more revealing than a grocery list.” In a recent interview, Hawke said that Chaos Angel , the album’s titular track, came out of the mindset she was in while making Wildcat , a film she did with her father Ethan where she played author Flannery O’Connor. It seems like being in such a space of imagination and creative empathy offers a fertile overlap for songwriting. “I think they work very well together, and I highly recommend that all actors write music,” she says, noting that acting’s a form of “reaching out” to better understand the world, while songwriting is an act of “digging deep” to figure out what you feel and think. Each practice lies in a desire to “express, pursue truth and tell stories”, says Hawke, but she admits, as her music career flourishes, that it’s becoming difficult to juggle both. Is there some sort of plan to how she navigates her career or is she just feeling her way through? “I still audition a bunch and I’ve taken most every good job that’s come my way. I think that a lot of people see the roles that actors choose as, like, intensely reflective on them, and that’s partially true. But also, most actors I know, even really successful ones, are kind of going with the flow and, like, whatever good writing comes their way they want to do, basically,” says Hawke. “I mean, you’d be hard-pressed to find a kind of person that’s more gung ho, ‘put me in, coach!’ than an actor – they’re a pretty excitable group of volunteers.” Having veterans in her corner (yes, Mum and Dad), only helps to a degree. “I think people really overestimate the amount of strategy that goes into an actor’s career, you know?” Hawke jokes. “I mean, it’s a lot of auditioning, taking the jobs that come your way, and hoping that more do. “The advice I get from my parents is always more minutiae-based – ‘I don’t want to do this job but it’s a good job, would I be stupid not to do it?’ or ‘What should I do if I’m having an uncomfortable experience with my scene partner?’ In terms of what projects to do and how to spend your career, that’s mostly 90 per cent luck and 10 per cent instinct.” Her next role will see her playing Anxiety in Pixar’s Inside Out 2 , a casting stroke that feels inspired considering her public persona – that rare star who appears introverted, slightly uncomfortable with the spotlight. “Wow, is that my persona?” Hawke says. “I don’t feel like that’s who I am as a person. I mean, of course I have anxiety, but I don’t think I have any more anxiety than the average person. In fact, I might be lucky enough to have a little bit less.” OK, but has she ever seen herself on a talk show? There’s a kind of charming, nervous energy there that is a large part of what makes her feel relatable to audiences, despite her atypical upbringing. Is it painful for her to get up on stage, or to see herself on screen? “I mean, I’m not gonna be like, ‘No, I’m totally comfortable on stage!’ I’m totally nervous and excited, and I feel like I want to express myself and I want to be understood, and I’m afraid that I won’t be or that I won’t be good enough. But it doesn’t feel painful, it’s joyful,” says Hawke. “There’s a great David Bowie quote about that: ‘You want to be just deep enough in the water so that your toes don’t touch the bottom’. That’s how I feel. I’m happiest when I’m just deep enough out there into the realm of what scares me that my toes don’t touch the bottom, and I can explore that and just, you know, kick my feet a little.” Maya Hawke’s Chaos Angel is out on May 31.

        "content": "The NBA conference finals are lacking drama, as both series appear headed for a sweep and a finals clash between the Celtics and Mavericks. Indiana goes into Game 4 on Monday night attempting to save their season as a 7.5-point home underdog. Oddsmakers at DraftKings , among others, are clearly expecting a sweep. Ahead of Game 1 , we noted that the Celtics do not turn the ball over nor do they get their shots blocked. Wise bettors have smashed that trend into oblivion. Those prop projections have all plummeted thanks to a 100 percent win rate on Myles Turner’s blocks, steals, and blocks + steals prop in each of the first three games. Bettors who have followed the trend are more than 10 units of profit on three games, but oddsmakers, as always, are adjusting. Turner’s prop projection is down to 1.5 steals + blocks ahead of Game 4, and there likely will be no Tyrese Haliburton going forward . (8 p.m. ET, ESPN) Many have joked about Andrew Nembhard’s sudden emergence as he’s thrown up shots and connected on many, especially during a 32-point outburst in Game 3 . He kept the Pacers on top for most of that game before the Celtics furiously rallied to win. If Nembhard can’t keep up that hot shooting, the Pacers are live to get smoked Monday at home. And that’s where we could see some mop-up duty from guys like Peyton Pritchard, Sam Hauser and Xavier Tillman Sr. Based on the oddsmaker’s opinion of this game, it should seem likely that the Celtics are able to sit their starters for large portions of Monday’s contest. Hauser played 22 minutes in the Game 2 blowout (1-for-5 from 3-point range). Target Hauser in Game 4; he’s taking a ton of shots and his poor shooting has been nothing short of shocking, considering the Pacers own the worst defense in the NBA playoffs. Hauser is 1-for-11 in this series, taking multiple 3-pointers in each game he has played. His projection is 3.5 points, according to FanDuel and BetMGM, but given the expected game script and freedom he’s being given to fire away whenever he has the ball, he’s a good bet. Hauser’s overs are all worth targeting. Here’s my plan of attack for Game 4. PICKS: Hauser over 3.5 points scored (-113, BetMGM ) | 2+ 3-pointers made (+175, FanDuel ) | 10+ points scored (+500, Bet365 )",

That’s six play-off encounters they have been involved in spanning close to three...The post Neil Warnock states what he noticed about Daniel Farke when Dan James hit the crossbar for Leeds appeared first on HITC.",
        "content": "That’s six play-off encounters they have been involved in spanning close to three decades and they have all ended in defeat. Some would say that’s typical because they have a serious mental blockage when it comes to these games, as they proved during their on Sunday. When hit the crossbar, it sent a shudder down the spine of both sets of supporters because the game was coming to an end and it was a moment that could have changed everything. The Yorkshire outfit, after falling behind to an early Adam Armstrong goal, just couldn’t play their natural game and Russell Martin was tactically outdoing , again! Southampton were the only team during the regular season to do the double over Leeds – and that showed at the home of football. Neil Warnock made it clear that ‘the best team won tactically’ even if he thinks highly about the man in the Elland Road dugout. , Warnock shared that he instantly looked down at the Leeds manager and noticed that ‘he knew’ that was it and the game was gone, as he told (26/05/24 at 5:55 pm). Very little time was left and if the Whites had any luck, then that effort would have hit the back of the net, but in the end, it’s another season in the Championship for Leeds. Leeds United lose play-off final to Southampton “When James hit the crossbar, I looked down at Daniel (Farke) and I think he knew,” said Warnock. “When that hit the crossbar, I think he knew that it wasn’t going to be. He shouldn’t batter himself because he has done a brilliant job. He is a lovely man and I think he is a good manager. “But I thought the best team won tactically. Look at that here, that’s a volley, no chance for the goalkeeper and any other way, it goes in. That’s in, it’s then a different game and they are on top. That’s football and you need a bit of luck, a referee decision or the smallest of things.” Big pressure on Daniel Farke You can’t see the manager leaving, whether that’s moving on himself or getting booted out. But this defeat does put huge pressure on him heading into the forthcoming campaign because nothing but promotion is expected. Two of the relegated sides – Leicester City and Southampton – did their jobs, so Leeds can’t have any excuses, in that regard. The issue for the club is that if you offered them a play-off finish next season, then fans wouldn’t probably accept it because they know what’s coming. But now it’s about dealing with the present, , they better hope that he is the only one.",

        "description": "From student to director, Lisa Pavane’s storied 46-year journey with the Australian Ballet School is drawing to a close.",
        "content": "Lisa Pavane arrived at the Australian Ballet School as a starry-eyed teenager. Forty-six years later, she’s leaving after nine years as its director. The school celebrates its 60th anniversary in 2024, but has only been overseen by four directors across that period. Each person who led the school clearly left their mark; during Pavane’s tenure, the old stereotype of the draconian ballet taskmaster who demands everything of their students has been replaced by an approach she describes as “holistic”. Lisa Pavane is retiring after nine years helming the Australian Ballet School. Credit: Hilary Walker “We’re so fortunate in the way that we’re looking at our young people and their health and wellbeing. That’s a real lens now,” she says. “It’s a very vigorous vocation, so having that education around how you look after your body and how you learn about it and how you fuel it, prepare it, condition it, is leaps and bounds from when I went to the school.” When Pavane was a student, there was an implicit understanding that dancers were to be seen and not heard. Now the atmosphere is one of collaboration. “We’re trying to break down that hierarchy, that power between teacher and student and really levelling it out. Inviting young people to step into the space, to be their own learners and understand their learning. We’re inviting a lot more conversation.” Greg Horsman and Lisa Pavane perform in Giselle, 1990. Credit: The Australian Ballet Dancer and choreographer Kevin Jackson says that Pavane’s interest in giving students more chances to explore their own artistic voice and contribute to classes has lifted the local ballet scene on the whole. “Lisa’s been a visionary in her response to investing in homegrown talent. She’s given the students of today the opportunity to experience the creative part of the profession, and allowed a space for choreographers to explore their art.” Pavane says that a nurturing learning environment leads to far better outcomes than a whip-cracking, disciplinarian approach. Lisa Pavane is proud of the way the school has become more receptive to outside influences during her time at the helm. Credit: Lynette Wills “We know through positive education and psychology that when they’re happy, they’re thriving, they’re flourishing, they’re feeling comfortable in the space, then their brain is open and they’re much more open to learning. That’s our philosophy, embedded in what we do every day now.” Pavane is also proud of the way the school has become less of a closed shop and more receptive to outside influences during her time at the helm. “I’ve worked to try and open up the school so that we have more accessibility and more connection with the community. “We have an incredible love and passion for teaching and dancing and nurturing the future generation of dancers. We can all learn from each other. We’re really trying to inspire that and not feel that we’re better than anyone else.” In the nine years she has been the school’s director, Pavane hasn’t been the sort who leads from afar. “Lisa is very involved,” says Jackson. “She’s always there for assessments and will come into rehearsals for the productions we do, as a mentor not only to the choreographer but also to the students.” Pavane has been an influential mentor in Jackson’s own career, from his time training as a teacher at the school to his development as a choreographer. But along with the success stories come those who don’t find a career in dance is on the cards. “We talk about the holistic person and the skills that they learn, whether it be from one year, three years, five years of this amazing discipline, that they can take into all walks of life. When we hear back from young people that have left the school for whatever reason they speak so highly of the skills you learn from being in this artistic field,” says Pavane. After graduating from the school, Pavane rose to become a principal artist at the Australian Ballet before enjoying a long international career. En Pointe , the final Australian Ballet School performance under her stewardship, will be performed at Hamer Hall on May 28 and at The Round, Nunawading on August 21. She’s looking forward to a little break, but she’s not putting her feet up for good. “This school gave me my life, it gave me my career, and I’ve loved every minute that I’ve spent in it ... I’m certainly not going to be putting on my slippers and sitting on the couch with my knitting needles just yet.” En Pointe is on at Hamer Hall on May 28 and The Round on August 21.

        "description": "Annette King, Yukon's child and youth advocate, is calling for better legal representation for young people involved in court matters. She's also wants her office to be able to review any child deaths that happen in the territory.",
        "content": "Annette King admits that even after nine years as Yukon's child and youth advocate, she still finds many people don't quite understand what she does. \"I think everywhere we go and every time we meet with a different group, or even an individual client or family that comes to our office, we have to explain our role,\" she said. \"And I do think over the last several years, people are getting a broader understanding of what we do, as there's more experiences with our office, more reports that we've released publicly.\" The advocate office was created by territorial legislation passed in 2009. Written into the Child and Youth Advocate Act was a requirement for the all-party Members' Services Board to establish a process to review the act, within five years. Fifteen years later, that review is underway. King spoke to CBC's Yukon Morning host Elyn Jones about the review, and some of the recommendations she's making to update the legislation. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Who have you heard from so far, in this review? We've been talking about this review in my whole term, which is now nine years. So we provide a little bit of input on what we've heard to date, each year in our annual report. And so at the beginning, what we've really focused on was our experiences to date, so what we were hearing from the people accessing our services and the service providers that we'd be working with. And we'd be like, \"OK, so if the act was amended, we'd want to really look at this or look at this.\" And then we worked really closely with youth advisors. So we contracted youth advisory groups. We've had a few different iterations of youth leading the way to review our legislation. They created a youth-friendly version of the legislation so that it made a little bit more sense. We connected really closely with the territorial youth collective as the territorial youth strategy was being developed. Then also we've stayed connected to service providers and First Nation governments throughout the years. Over the last year, I've been really targeting those conversations because I want to make sure that the First Nations governance, as it is intended to be, you know, in parallel to the Yukon government, that that is definitely represented in our legislation. And those conversations have been really deep and meaningful. One of the things that you're asking for is a mechanism to review deaths of children. Why is that so important? When this act came into place in 2009, it was a small little act. And I think that's partly why the review in five years was built into it, it was like, \"let's just start here, let's really get things so that young people have a voice in government services, and then we'll look at building it from there.\" Every other child advocate in the country — and there are 12 — have a child death review mandate. And so it's one of those questions that we've been asking over all of the years to anybody that we talked to about the legislation: how do you see that working? And we've had some great conversations with the coroner and with the death review investigators across the country. We've really looked at what could be a model for the Yukon. And so that's kind of what we're trying to develop. You're also calling for legal representation for children and youth, and better information-sharing. Tell us more about that. So when a child needs legal representation, it's usually three different ways. A youth over 12 that's been charged with a crime would need a lawyer for the criminal investigation. That is already in place really well, through legal aid — every young person who's been accused of a crime has access to legal representation there. In family law, there's two areas that we want to make sure young people of all ages have legal representation to make sure their views and rights are upheld in court. And that is, if there's a court matter regarding the Child and Family Services Act — so their placement, or if their custody is being changed as a result of being in that system — we want to make sure young people are represented in that system. Our office can represent young people in the decision-making and in the case planning. But when it goes to court, we don't have a role. And we want to make sure that that happens. And the other one is, we get so many calls regarding child custody matters and high-conflict custody matters where a parent will say, \"my child needs a view in this process. How do I make sure that happens?\" Our office isn't... we don't have child lawyers that go to court. We actually have a clause in our legislation now that says we can't interfere and impede with the court process. So we're trying to create that access for young people to have legal representation in those big matters where the adults have the, you know, the applicant, the respondent, the court decisions — but the child's voice matters in these things that impact their lives. When will you be presenting your recommendations? That's really up to the Legislative Assembly. I report to an all-party committee, so all three parties are represented on that. They've asked me to provide a submission to them of what we're recommending. I provide recommendations to them every year, but this one will be more fulsome. And we're hoping that we do some more targeted interviews over the summer and get that to them as soon as possible. Yukon ombudsman says territory's Safer Schools Action Plan doesn't go far enough 'Time for some action': Review to look at systemic racism in Yukon education I think we're at a point now where we've had so many conversations — and since I'm talking publicly, I want to thank everybody who's contributed. We've had even a sort of outline of what we're looking at on our website for the last several months. We just want to make sure we're getting it right, or that we're not missing other things. So we're continuing these conversations. Over the last year, I've been doing most of them myself. Like, I just wanna hear it myself 'cause I've been so in this act — like I'm in it, right? And I know what's going on. I've heard all the different stories and I'm putting them all together. And it's been a fascinating process. And I really hope that we'll be able to just advocate even more effectively for children in the Yukon. Can people still have their say? Absolutely. Yeah, this is not even close to done. On our website, we've got it right on the home page . And also on our website there's an e-mail address that people can just click. We have Facebook, Instagram. Or they can just call our office and set up a time to chat. I'm not huge into the surveys because like you said, what is this act? And unless you're in it, you don't really understand what the questions are. So what we've done is we've identified six areas of conversation, so six themes, and we've put like, one-pages on what our experiences are in that, and there's some key questions. So if somebody's really into writing a survey-type of answer to that, we are thrilled to have that. We've already had a few. I find those are good guides to creating the conversation. So, look at the themes and then call me and let's sit down and talk about it, if you have lots to say about it.",

        "content": "Hackers are taking advantage of the Windows launch of Arc browser to trick victims into downloading malware . Arc is a relatively new internet browser , first launched for macOS in the summer of 2023 - and initial feedback from both media and the users was positive enough to prompt the release of a Windows version too. However, at the same time, unidentified hackers were creating websites with typosquatted domains, seemingly identical to the browser’s actual website. They were also creating ads on Google which, due to certain problems the network has, displayed the legitimate website, but redirected people to the typosquatted one. This meant customers who wanted to install Arc on their Windows device, and had used Google to search for it, would find an ad in the very top of Google’s search results page. The ad seemingly pointed to the site’s actual website, but led the victims to a malicious site which offered an infected version of the browser’s installer, hosted on MEGA, for download. Anyone who downloaded this installer would get the browser, but also malware which, according to initial reports, seems to be an infostealer, although confirmation on the malware’s nature is still pending. Hackers are always taking advantage of major events and product launches to try and trick people into giving away sensitive data, or downloading malware. Events such as the FIFA World Cup, Olympic Games, Chat-GPT launch, Windows 11 launch, and others, have all been abused in the past to deliver bad code to people. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The best way to protect against these attacks is to always type the website address into the browser, instead of “just googling” it. If you don’t know the site, be mindful of the search engine results, and always double-check the characters in the address bar before downloading anything. Via BleepingComputer",

        "description": "Pinole resident Jeanne Gibson, 98, helped make history during World War II as a \"Rosie the Riveter.\" On the 80th anniversary of D-Day, she'll be one of about 70 heroes of that conflict honored in France.",
        "content": "PINOLE — Feeling she wasn’t giving enough to the war effort after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Jeanne Gibson — at the time only 18 years old — traded her nursing school life in Minnesota for a welding job in the shipyards of Seattle. Now 98, Pinole resident Gibson will be one of about 70 American World War II heroes honored in France on the 80th anniversary of D-Day, when Allied forces stormed the beaches of Normandy, eventually leading to the liberation of France and the end of the war. “During World War II, everyone was on the same page. We were working to get it over with so we could get our boys back home,” Gibson said in an interview. “Everybody was just doing what they could. It was great and we were all working together. It was a good time as well as being a bad time because of the war.” The millions of women like Gibson who worked in American shipyards and factories during World War II — many of them stepping into the industrial workforce for the first time while the men who had formerly worked such jobs were deployed overseas — became known as “Rosie the Riveters,” after the song of the same name. The 1942 hit, popularized by several artists, could have been about Gibson herself: “All the day long, whether rain or shine / She’s a part of the assembly line / She’s making history, working for victory / Rosie, the riveter.” Whether or not there was a “real” Rosie on which the song was based is much-debated, but the most iconic image of Rosie the Riveter became the wartime poster by Pittsburgh artist J. Howard Miller of a woman with the sleeve of her industrial blue uniform rolled up, flexing her bicep as she proclaims, “We can do it!” Beginning May 31, Gibson and other honorees will be flown out to the headquarters of American Airlines in Fort Worth, Texas, where they’ll receive a send-off parade before boarding a charter flight to Paris. The trip will culminate in a ceremony on June 6 at the Normandy American Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, France, where more than 9,000 American WWII soldiers are buried. The trip is made possible through a partnership between American Airlines and the nonprofit Old Glory Honor Flight. Gibson, one of only two Rosie the Riveters participating in the event, and a recent recipient of a Congressional Medal of Honor, said she’s excited for the adventure. It’s far from the first in her lifetime though; besides her World War II welding work, she’s also earned a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley, as well as a pilot license, and traveled abroad over the decades since. Before moving to Seattle, Washington, to weld warships, Gibson was studying to become a nurse in Minneapolis, having heard the position was in demand during the war. She remembers listening to the radio when news broke about the attack on Pearl Harbor and wanting to be of service. But after two quarters studying nursing, she said she realized the role wasn’t for her. She and a school friend, Esther Harri, landed roles as welders at the Todd Pacific Shipyards in Seattle, working the cold evening shift in their safety helmets, leather overalls, jeans and long underwear purchased with their first checks. Gibson later took on another role making manifests and hatch lists for the Army Transportation Corps’ Embarkation Center in Juneau. Whether welding or filling out ledgers, Gibson said she loved and took great pride in the work. “Without World War II and what happened, I would be an entirely different person,” Gibson said. “It gave me courage to go ahead and I can do it. And it gave me some backbone.” After the war, Gibson moved to San Francisco and then Berkeley. She went on to earn a bachelor’s in psychology, and a master’s and Ph.D. in educational psychology from UC Berkeley, where she also taught multiple sections of educational psychology 101. While writing her dissertation, she also taught science to local schoolchildren and would end up dedicating 30 years of her life to teaching kindergarten through sixth grade. She and Harri earned their pilot licenses and joined a local chapter of the Ninety-Nines, a group for women pilots started by famed flyer Amelia Earhart and 98 others. They traveled the world, socialized with an assortment of friends, and picked up hobbies like weaving and baking. After attending a trip to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii in December of 2023, Gibson was inspired to begin telling her story to hundreds of visitors nearly every Friday at the Rosie the Riveter National Historical Park in Richmond, which honors the contributions of women during World War II. The work is what’s keeping her going, Gibson said, noting she especially enjoys encouraging young girls to fight for what they deserve, including fair pay. “I say don’t limit yourself to what you think you can do,” Gibson said. “You can do it and don’t let them pay you less.”",

        "content": "A Calgary man facing a murder charge after human remains were discovered by firefighters west of the city was in court Monday as lawyers dealt with a conflict issue. Christopher Stack, 39, faces a charge of first-degree murder in the death of Kyle Schuiling, 33. Court records suggest police aren't sure when Schuiling was killed. The offence dates listed on court documents show Stack is accused of murdering Schuiling between April 1 and April 3, 2024. Lawyer in conflict Schuiling's body was found by members of the Tsuut'ina Nation Fire Department as they were extinguishing a grass fire in Rocky View County near Range Road 40 and Township Road 241 early in the morning of April 3. Police charged Stack a month after Schuiling's remains were discovered. Stack was also in court Monday on other, unrelated charges, including possession of stolen property, driving offences and breaching court-ordered conditions. Justice Jim Ogle heard that Andrea Urquhart, Stack's lawyer on his previous charges, cannot act for him on the murder charge because she knew the victim and is in a conflict. Instead, defence lawyer Tonii Roulston will take the case. Stack will be back in court in two weeks.",

Punters who reached the end in dismal conditions were left disappointed to be told they had run out of - not only medals but also t-shirts in certain sizes and other goody bag items.

        "content": "TRADITIONAL FISHING GROUND In this November 2016 photo, a Filipino fisherman catches fish as the China Coast Guard patrols Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal in the West Philippine Sea, a traditional fishing ground for Zambales and Pangasinan fishers. —Richard A. Reyes/Inquirer MANILA, Philippines — Filipino fisherfolk continue to sail in the West Philippine Sea despite China’s intrusive fishing ban there, a unilateral annual policy which the government and analysts deem to be illegal and baseless while also being generally ignored by local trawlers even in previous years. Leonardo Cuaresma, president of the Zambales-based New Masinloc Fishermen Association, on Monday said they were unaware that the ban had already begun. READ: DFA protests China’s fishing ban encroaching West Philippine Sea Beijing’s fishing moratorium in the South China Sea encroaches most of the West Philippine Sea in outright disregard of Manila’s sovereign rights inside its own exclusive economic zone (EEZ) where it is allowed to explore and manage all the resources as provided by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It already started on May 1, 2024 and is expected to last until September 16, 2024. READ: Chinese ships block convoy’s mother boat from reaching Scarborough “Our pangulongs go sailing [in the West Philippine Sea] everyday [despite the ban],” Cuaresma, told INQUIRER.net in a phone interview in Filipino, referring to an indigenous mother boat. Cuaresma, who has sailed in the West Philippine Sea for over four decades, also noted that he, along with hundreds of fishermen, already joined the civilian convoy led by five “pangulongs”—which attempted to reach Scarborough (Panatag) Shoal—also this month when Beijing’s moratorium is already in place. The fishing activities of small bancas and pangulongs during the mission went unimpeded, as witnessed by INQUIRER.net. However, the convoy was blocked to come near the vicinity of Panatag Shoal by 10 China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels in what the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) branded as an “overkill” response. The actions of CCG are in line with Beijing’s assertion of sovereignty in almost the entire South China Sea, including most of the West Philippine Sea, even if such a claim has been effectively invalidated by a July 2016 international tribunal ruling which stemmed from a case filed by Manila in 2013. Despite CCG’s latest demonstration of authority, a geopolitical analyst noted that Filipino fishermen were able to fish in the West Philippine Sea even in previous years. “Nevertheless, there are still risks of escalation,” Don McLain Gill, a lecturer at the De La Salle University’s Department of International Studies, said in a message to INQUIRER.net on Monday. Gill also said “we have to wait and see” as to how the administration of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. intends to address the lengthy ban. “This uncertainty and concern for miscalculation will likely raise pressures for the Marcos Jr. administration,” Gill noted. “It is likely for Manila to remain cautious and utilize its open channels with Beijing, while simultaneously emphasizing how the illicit and unilateral actions of China continue to derail bilateral ties,” he further said. In an expected move, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), through a diplomatic note, on Monday protested the fishing ban, calling it “illegal” under the “final and binding” 2016 Arbitral Award. The DFA would always lodge a protest whenever China announces this yearly moratorium. For Rommel Jude Ong, a retired Philippine Navy rear admiral and a professor at the Ateneo School of Government, the DFA should have completely disregarded China’s unilateral policy. “My personal opinion, we should just ignore it,” Ong said in a message to INQUIRER.net on Monday. “By protesting, we acknowledge its existence and inadvertently recognize it even in protest.” But for security expert Chester Cabalza, all other channels, like filing of a diplomatic protest, should be explored to defy Beijing’s policy and assert Manila’s rights in the West Philippine Sea. “This [fishing ban] should be defied,” Cabalza, president and founder of Manila-based think tank International Development and Security Cooperation, said in a message to INQUIRER.net on Monday. “We should encourage more of our Filipino fishers to continue their fishing rights in our maritime entitlements.” Cabalza further said: “If we submit ourselves to their domestic law, it means that we surrender to their will.” Which, Cuaresma said, the fisherfolk have no plans of doing, as PCG continues to allow the fishermen to sail in the West Philippine Sea. “As long as our government allows us, we will continue to fish and we will not allow our neighboring countries to bully us and interfere with our livelihood,” Cuaresma said.

        "content": "A resident of a shelter for medically vulnerable people experiencing homelessness is accused of killing a roommate Sunday, less than six months after the facility opened . The 62-year-old woman killed, named in a probable cause affidavit as Stephanie Lynne Hackett Carrasco, was staying at the Medically Vulnerable People Program Facility in Sandy. One of Carrasco’s two roommates woke up from a nap to find her draped in bed sheets, laying under her bed face down in a pool of blood with blunt force trauma to the back of the head. Sandy police arrested another roommate — a 60-year-old woman — on suspicion of murder and tampering with evidence. The Salt Lake Tribune generally does not name defendants unless they have been formally charged with a crime. According to the probable cause affidavit explaining the woman’s arrest, Carrasco was seen on security footage entering the room for the last time, and cameras captured the roommate accused of killing her leaving the room 40 minutes later. The affidavit says the roommate had “her arms full of what appears to be clothing and other personal items.” When the other roommate awoke and saw Carrasco unconscious, she reportedly called emergency medical services. Paramedics declared Carrasco dead when they arrived at the scene. Police noticed spots of blood on a red fanny pack the accused roommate was carrying when she returned to the room. The probable cause affidavit states police had not yet searched the room, but that detectives hoped to look for an object that could have been used to cause the injuries to Carrasco’s head. The roommate who allegedly struck and killed Carrasco declined to make a statement to police without a lawyer. It is unclear if she has retained an attorney. She is currently being held at Salt Lake County jail and has been denied bail. (Trent Nelson | The Salt Lake Tribune) A room at the Medically Vulnerable People Program Facility in Sandy on Friday, Dec. 8, 2023. A resident there is accused of killing her roommate Sunday. The Medically Vulnerable People Program Facility is located on 9000 South near Interstate 15 in Sandy, in a former EconoLodge motel. The facility is funded by both taxpayers and philanthropy. Michelle Flynn, the director of The Road Home — and organization that helps operate the facility — said in a statement Monday afternoon, “The events ... are tragic, our hearts are with those involved.” “The MVP program provides a safe and supportive environment where residents can rehabilitate from illness by accessing the necessary health care and care management services to find stability to move toward permanent housing and other long-term care solutions,” Flynn continued. “We are unwavering in our commitment to safety, ensuring a welcoming and secure environment for all those who seek refuge with us. We are working closely with law enforcement and other crisis services to support residents and staff. We will continue to work with our community partners to support ongoing needs as they arise.” The Salt Lake Tribune reported in December that the facility was designed to serve 165 people in need of specialized care, and that residents would either have their own rooms or share a room with one other person, depending on their condition. At the time of Sunday’s killing, three women were sharing a room.",

Ugwuka, a final year student of EBSU in the Department of English Language and Literature, allegedly committed suicide in her hostel apartment on Wednesday, May 23, 2024. Addressing journalists on Monday at the institution’s conference room, the Vice Chancellor, Professor Chigozie Ogbu, dismissed claims by the deceased that the accused lecturer was behind her failure. Ogbu’s briefing read in part: “When a student is confident that a lecturer has deliberately marked them down, and they are sure that they passed the exam, what the student does is to complain to the HOD or Dean and request re-marking, which will be sent to the Vice Chancellor’s office. “It is usually sent to another university to re-mark and let us know. Some of them, on very rare occasions, have returned positive, and whatever the student gets here is usually what they get from the other university after re-marking, and that is the process. “If at the last exam, the late student felt that she was marked down by the lecturer, she would have complained to the Dean and asked for re-marking, and the paper would have been sent to another place for re-marking. ‘But from what is seen, it’s not that the student deserves to pass, and she didn’t pass. And from the record, you will find out that this is not the only course that she didn’t pass.” Professor Ogbu further stated that, according to the certified true copy of Ugwuka Favour Chinonye’s results, with the registration number EBSU/2018/89726 for the Department of English Language and Literature, who registered in the year 2018/2019, and that is her 1st year. In her 1st year, she offered 9 courses out of which she failed 3 courses and had a CGP of 1.78. In the 2nd semester of her 1st year, she took 8 courses, out of which she failed 2 and had a CGP of 1.75, thereby having a sessional CGP of 1.76. Professor Ogbu continued, “In 2019/2020, which is her 2nd year, she registered a total of 10 courses. Out of the courses, she was absent in 2 courses: Intermediate English Composition (ENG 215) and Philosophy and Logic (GST 102). She was absent in the 2 courses out of the 8 she wrote, she failed 2. She had a GP of 1.41 in that 1st semester. In her 2nd semester, she registered 10 courses. Out of the 10 courses, she failed 4 and had a CGP of 1.82. Total CGP in her 2nd year is 1.62.” The Vice Chancellor went on to detail Ugwuka’s academic performance in subsequent years, concluding that she had outstanding courses, including ENG 416, which she failed twice.

        "description": "Change means that any body of water that meets the state definition of 'public water' will be granted legal protection, even if it isn't on the decades-old state inventory",
        "content": "A new state law expands legal protections for hundreds of miles of Minnesota waterways whose status had been uncertain. In the final days of the session, lawmakers passed language clarifying that a waterway that meets the legal definition is a public water, even if it’s not on a decades-old state inventory. The change was included in an omnibus environment and natural resources budget bill, which Gov. Tim Walz signed into law last week. “This is a backstop to say water courses that meet the definition in state law are water courses that belong to all of us as Minnesotans, and are due these protections that we’ve outlined for public waters,” said Carly Griffith, water program director for the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy. The bill’s passage followed a lengthy legal dispute over Limbo Creek, the last free-flowing stream in heavily-farmed Renville County. ADVERTISEMENT The county board did not require an environmental review of proposed improvements to the upper reaches of the creek, because it wasn’t listed on the public waters inventory. Environmental groups and the Department of Natural Resources argued the stream met the legal definition of a public water, warranting greater protection. A lower court agreed, and the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld that decision in 2022. In Minnesota, “where water is really central to our identity,” the state has taken an expansive view of what counts as a public water, Griffith said. That definition includes natural and altered waterways with a total drainage area greater than 2 square miles. “So that means it can include streams and creeks that aren’t the Mighty Mississippi River, but that are important to the local communities that rely on them,” Griffith said. She estimates the new law will affect at least 640 miles of waterways across the state. Griffith said there are errors in the state’s public waters inventory, which was created in the 1980s when the technology used to identify drainage areas was less advanced. The new law includes $8 million over the next eight years for the DNR to update the inventory. Some farm groups are concerned the new law could expand legal protections to more waterways and create uncertainty for farmers. Public waters have more regulations, including restrictions on draining and filling, and requirements to maintain vegetative buffers. Pierce Bennett, public policy director for the Minnesota Farm Bureau Federation, called it “a pretty dramatic expansion” of what could be labeled public waters, leaving farmers “in a little bit of limbo.” “Our view is that this would allow for a lot of waters that aren’t currently under that inventory to just simply be put in,” Bennett said. “And that is concerning.” ADVERTISEMENT He said farmers shared their concerns about the bill with legislators throughout the session, and plan to work with state regulators to understand its impacts. “We need to have a greater understanding of what this might mean for the future,” Bennett said. ______________________________________________________ This story was written by one of our partner news agencies.

But it says the Alberta Prosecution Service determined the circumstances didn’t meet its test to go to court. 1:45 Final arguments made on Lethbridge MLA’s LPS surveillance appeal The information is contained in a letter from the agency to the politician’s lawyer, Michael Bates.

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. While Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site. Monday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2009, and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately. “To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,” he explained, “you need to be playing often.” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” ___ This story has been corrected to fix the year of Nadal's loss to Soderling.

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here.

        "description": "The Nets will need some patience or some luck — or both — in order to reemerge as a legitimate contender in the East.",
        "content": "The Nets were a top-six seed in the Eastern Conference in 2022-23, but that was largely due to the work of a pre-trade-deadline roster led by Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving . After trading away Irving on Feb. 6 (an injured Durant was moved three days later), the team went 13-17 down the stretch and was swept out of the playoffs in the first round by Philadelphia. Those second-half and postseason results accurately reflected the level of the new-look roster, which underwent only marginal changes during the 2023 offseason. So it came as no real surprise that after hovering around .500 for much of the first half of this past season, Brooklyn eventually fell out of play-in contention, even in a weak Eastern Conference where the No. 10 seed finished with 36 wins. The team’s 32-50 record in 2023-24 wasn’t far off from its pace to finish the previous season. While the Nets have some talented young players on their roster, none appear to be on a fast track to superstardom, so roster changes will be necessary to increase the team’s ceiling. But there’s no simple path to legitimate upgrades — Brooklyn is capped out this summer and doesn’t own a 2024 draft pick. Going in the other direction and bottoming out in the hopes of landing a future star in the 2025 or 2026 draft isn’t really a viable path either, since the Nets don’t control their own first-round draft pick until 2028. As a result of the 2021 trade for James Harden , Brooklyn owes the Rockets its unprotected first-rounder in both 2024 (No. 3 overall) and 2026, along with swap rights in 2025 and 2027. The situation isn’t quite as dire as it was for a few years in Brooklyn after the team’s misguided decision to mortgage several years of draft assets in a deal for Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce, which lined up the Celtics to draft Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum in consecutive years. But the Nets will need some patience or some luck — or both — in order to reemerge as a legitimate contender in the East. The Nets’ Offseason Plan Mikal Bridges is the best player – and asset – on the Nets’ roster, but he was miscast as a No. 1 option in 2023-24. His play declined in the second half, and while he’d never ask for a night off (he hasn’t missed a single game since entering the league in 2018), the veteran forward probably wouldn’t mind facing a little less defensive attention going forward. Bridges averaged just 15.7 points per game on 39.9% shooting in his final 31 games of the season. Bridges makes perfect sense as the second or third option on a contending team, slotting into a role like the one OG Anunoby played for the Knicks — he can make three-pointers and handle challenging defensive assignments, but he’s better off as a secondary scorer, not as someone who constantly has the ball in his hands. Whether Bridges ends up in a more appropriate role in Brooklyn or elsewhere is the question. As noted above, the Nets don’t have cap room or draft picks this summer, so the only way to turn Bridges into their No. 2 option in 2024-25 would be to trade for a star. That scenario isn’t out of the question. Despite not controlling their own draft picks in the coming years, the Nets have an excess of future assets from other teams — namely Dallas and Phoenix — as a result of last year’s Irving and Durant trades. They also have a huge salary-matching piece in Ben Simmons , who will make $40.3M on an expiring contract in 2024-25. Brooklyn has frequently been linked to Donovan Mitchell and could certainly be a player in the bidding for the Cavaliers guard or another star who hits the trade market this summer. I’d question whether that’s the right approach though. Mitchell – or an equivalent star – would certainly make the Nets a better team, but he wouldn’t make them a legitimate title contender, and the cost (not only in trade assets but in the form of a long-term maximum-salary contract for the incoming star) would limit the club’s ability to pursue further upgrades. Team owner Joe Tsai recently talked about taking a “longer-term approach” to team-building, and the hiring of a player development specialist like Jordi Fernandez as Brooklyn’s new head coach suggests the organization isn’t looking to take big swings after a 32-50 season unless a can’t-miss opportunity falls into its lap. I’d be surprised if the Nets make a blockbuster win-now deal this offseason — it makes more sense to build up the roster patiently and incrementally like they did the last time they went through a retooling process without their own draft picks. Of course, there is another potential route available to the Nets: Bridges would have significant value on the trade market. Head of basketball operations Sean Marks and his front office have been adamantly opposed to trading Bridges despite reportedly receiving strong offers ever since they acquired him last February, and I understand that stance. His skill set is a coveted one and he’s proven he can play big minutes on a championship contender, having been a full-time starter for the Suns team that got within two wins of a title in 2021. You don’t want to trade that sort of player. Plus, as we noted earlier, making next year’s roster even worse wouldn’t benefit the Nets from a draft perspective as long as they don’t control their picks. But what if they did control their picks? The Rockets, who have prioritized two-way players since Ime Udoka‘s arrival last spring, reportedly covet Bridges and were said to be prepared to put a strong offer on the table for him at February’s trade deadline. Could it be in the Nets’ best interest, long-term, to consider a Bridges deal with Houston that would return their own 2026 pick and eliminate those 2025 and 2027 swap rights? Even if this year’s No. 3 pick isn’t included in the package (it could be), regaining control of those future picks would put Brooklyn in position to properly rebuild with valuable lottery picks in the next year or two. They could take the rebuild a step further by also entertaining trade offers for wings Dorian Finney-Smith and Cameron Johnson , both of whom would hold real appeal for playoff teams. There’s no simple answer here for the Nets. While negotiating with the Rockets makes some sense on the surface, Houston would presumably recognize that Brooklyn’s own first-round picks are more valuable to the Nets than another team’s first-rounders would be, which would give the Rockets added leverage in any trade talks. And is Marks’ job security strong enough — after he was given the chance to hire his fourth head coach this spring — that he’d be willing to take another step backward by hitting the reset button again? I’m skeptical, which is why I consider Bridges more likely than not to open the 2024-25 season as a Net. The decisions the Nets make on the trade market could have a huge impact on the franchise, but the front office has the option of simply taking a wait-and-see approach on that front. That’s not the case in free agency, where starting center Nic Claxton will become an unrestricted free agent this summer, giving him the ability to leave Brooklyn without the team getting any compensation. The Nets will do all they can to avoid that happening, which might mean going up to $25M per year — or even a little higher — to retain the young big man, who has emerged as a reliable rim protector and rebounder up front and still might have his best years ahead of him. Fernandez and Marks didn’t do themselves any favors in their upcoming negotiations with the 25-year-old by declaring last month that they believe he’s a future Defensive Player of the Year, but he would’ve been in line for a major payday anyway. For what it’s worth, Jarrett Allen signed a five-year, $100M free agent contract back in 2021 when his résumé wasn’t all that dissimilar to Claxton’s and a $20M salary represented about 17.8% of the cap. Three years later, 17.8% of the projected 2024-25 cap would be almost exactly $25M. The Nets will also have contract decisions to make on Cam Thomas and Day’Ron Sharpe , though there’s less urgency in those cases — both Thomas and Sharpe are extension-eligible beginning this July, but would be on track for restricted free agency in 2025 if no deal is reached before the 2024-25 regular season begins. As long as Brooklyn is able to re-sign Claxton, I wouldn’t count on a new deal for Sharpe this offseason. Big man Noah Clowney flashed real promise toward the end of his rookie season, and if he continues to improve, he could push Sharpe for the role of Claxton’s primary backup next season. The Nets may want to see more from both players before deciding in 2025 whether to invest long-term in Sharpe. Thomas is a trickier case. He’s a genuinely gifted scorer, having racked up 22.5 points per game in his third NBA season, but he doesn’t do much else on offense and has been a subpar defender. His ability to put the ball in the basket is valuable, but Brooklyn will likely be reluctant to break the bank on a player whose game outside of that one skill is so limited. It wouldn’t surprise me if the two sides have a hard time bridging the gap between the contract the Nets are comfortable offering and the one Thomas will seek. It’s also worth noting that if the Nets simply keep Simmons’ expiring contract on their books for the 2024-25 season and don’t add any long-term money to their cap besides Claxton, they’ll be well-positioned to create real financial flexibility a year from now, when Simmons’ $40M+ and Dennis Schröder ‘s $13M contract end. Locking up Thomas early would cut into that room, assuming his next deal starts above his projected 2025 cap hold of $12.1M. That’s another argument in favor of holding off on a new deal for the 22-year-old until next year.

        "description": "Quebec provincial police confirmed they're investigating what appears to be a case of modern cattle rustling.",
        "content": "Jonathan Fortin woke up Friday morning to check on his herd of Black Angus cattle, only to find his field was empty. Fortin, who co-owns Ferme For Thé in Quebec’s Eastern Townships, said he initially thought his calves and cows might have got loose, but the presence of tire tracks and a fence that appeared to have been dismantled led him to conclude that something more sinister had occurred. “All my herd — close to 75 animals — were stolen,” he said in an interview Monday. Quebec provincial police confirmed they’re investigating what appears to be a case of modern cattle rustling. Police spokesman Louis-Philippe Ruel confirmed police opened a criminal investigation after arriving at the farm in Cookshire-Eaton, Que., on Friday and finding the cattle had “disappeared.” Ruel didn’t say how police were planning to retrace the herd, but he noted the thieves would need to have access to equipment and a place to put the animals. Story continues below advertisement “You can’t move that many livestock in a Honda Civic or a Toyota Corolla,” he said in a phone interview. 2:29 Health Matters: CFIA steps us avian influenza surveillance Fortin figures the cattle were taken between 6 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. on Thursday, while he was out working his second job. He said neighbours later reported seeing trailer lights and hearing a commotion in his field, but at the time they assumed it was buyers coming to pick up cattle. Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens. He said the loss of about $200,000 worth of livestock represents a good portion of his savings and four hard years of work building up his farm. “There’s a lot of emotion, because even if it’s a new business, it’s still all the work and the life savings,” he said. “To have a herd of that size, there were a lot of sacrifices that were made, it means sometimes working two jobs, things like that.” Story continues below advertisement Fortin says it isn’t easy to load dozens of cattle into trailers, but it’s not impossible for someone with experience. He said the animals are marked by tags, but he believes thieves would be able to remove them. While he’s heard stories about stolen cattle, he never thought his entire herd could be taken all at once. He said thefts usually involve individual calves that are taken by people who want to raise them for meat. Fortin is still hopeful police will be able to find his lost animals, which weren’t insured against theft. If not, he says he’ll have to rebuild his herd two or three animals at a time, while pushing back his plans to give up his second job to farm full-time. “For sure it’s very difficult physically, and even more so morally, because we’re restarting at zero,” he said.

        "description": "She has learned about different cultures and is grateful the diversity has taught her.",
        "content": "Leavitt Area High School senior Tamara Rusakovich has attended several different schools and said she has been exposed to diverse cultures along the way. Russ Dillingham/Sun Journal TURNER — Leavitt Area High School senior Tamara Rusakovich, 18, has the kind of perseverance and determination that inspires others around her, Principal Eben Shaw said. An engaged member of the high school and community, she helped raise money for local youth athletics by selling clothes donated to her and donating the leftovers to local clothes closets, he said. It is one example of the ways she has affected her community. “She’s been a great student here at Leavitt and I have no doubt she will be equally impactful at Colby next year,” he said. Attending several different schools, Rusakovich said she has learned there is a much larger world or different cultures and ways of life beyond where one attends schools or the town they are raised in. “I will always be grateful for these schools teaching me different ways of life, being exposed to different cultures and diversity, but for also teaching me how to advocate for myself in an unfamiliar place — finding my independence,” she said. Best part of each day? The best part of each day is being able to talk to my biggest support system here at Leavitt. The teachers, whether it be lunch talks or just saying hi in the hallways, and the relationships I have built with teachers here have brightened my worst days at school. Worst part of each day? I think the worst part of each day is being in those particular classes with students who don’t care about their education. It’s hard to see the contrasting classes of honors to regular and the disrespect many teachers have to endure. When kids start to disrespect the learning of other students because they don’t want to learn, it’s hard to find motivation to perform in those classes. Favorite class or subject? Why? My favorite classes/subjects throughout school have been literature and government. In these classes, you have the freedom to think individually, critique, analyze, and form your own conclusions. In typical math and science classes, there is one answer and one answer only, whereas in government and literature, you have moments in class to talk and debate with your classmates, to form your conclusion on an idea or theme. I just love that freedom of thought and not having to be perfect all the time. I never knew I would find such a passion for government since so many aspects within government have made me upset but I have found a huge passion for learning about government so that I can properly defend myself and hopefully one day advocate for others, through better knowledge of government ideals. Favorite teacher or school staff member? Why? The teachers who have made the biggest impact on my adjustment here at Leavitt are Mrs. Marcotte, Mr. Cifelli, Mrs. Talbot and Mr. Strong. These teachers have given me a sense of community, understanding and support. With everything I have been through in the past few years, I can always count on Marcotte or Cifelli to talk to and support me. Strong and Talbot offer a safe space for me to talk but also to make mistakes without feeling guilty. Their classrooms have become places where I may have struggled but I could see myself grow in my time there and my time getting to know them. These teachers will be the teachers I remember for a lifetime with how much they have helped me to open up. What was the hardest part of high school and how did you find your way through it? The hardest part about high school was the feeling of loneliness. Moving to three new schools, one of which being in a new state with 2,000 kids, it is easy to just be swallowed up by the crowd. Or moving to a small school where everyone has grown up together, meaning you’ll never really be accepted. One year leaves no time for you to truly find your place and leave a mark at a school. The hardest conclusion I had to come to was that I couldn’t rely on anybody anymore and at times I only had myself and I had to advocate to have my voice heard. Though, it has been a really good experience to learn more about myself as well as find my voice and be a little louder. And although it’s hard to find your people when moving, once you do find that select group, it’s worth it. How do you think you’ll be remembered by the members of your class? I’m not sure how I will be remembered at Leavitt or in my class but I have been told many times that I have made a huge impact at Leavitt for the better and that is my only goal in life, to make a difference and make someone’s life better. I think I have accomplished this by starting an outing club, raising awareness about sustainability and just trying to spread positivity. However, I don’t want people to remember me for these things that I did, I’d rather have them remember what they learned from those things and hopefully carry on the difference I may have made. Something you wish teachers and administrators understood about students today? Something I wish teachers and administrators knew about students today is that life is hard for everyone out there right now. Although this older generation believes that our generation is weak, we have to endure so many more things that affect our mental health differently, social media being a huge factor. I also believe that students nowadays are held to such high expectations and it is engraved into our minds that we are failures if we make one mistake. Everyone is going through something and we all handle it differently. So just be aware, be understanding, and help kids succeed rather than trying to fail kids. If I didn’t have those teachers to see my full character through a lot of tough times at home, I wouldn’t be where I am now. Some kids just need to feel understood in this craziness of the world nowadays. Advice to all those eighth graders entering high school next year? One piece of advice I have for freshman next year, and honestly anybody at Leavitt. Don’t conform to the crowd. Find yourself, find what you stand for and don’t settle for anything that makes you less than happy. Something I notice with incoming freshmen is that it is almost forced upon everyone to join a sport or a club. You don’t need to conform to the very few sports or clubs here at Leavitt. If you have other hobbies or interests, pursue those instead of devoting time to something you don’t love. Start a club of your interest! I wish I attended Leavitt longer to get more people involved in our outing club. Just do what makes you happy, not what makes other people happy. If I never took my own initiative and only listened to others I wouldn’t be where I am today. I still have regrets about passions I never pursued and opportunities I lost, so never let expectations or people hold you back. What is next for you after graduation? My plan after high school is to attend Colby College and pursue Environmental Policy and Government. I want to make a difference in the world and help advocate for basic human rights and the environment.

        "description": "Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas.",
        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel faced new condemnation Monday for strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah that local health officials said killed at least 45 Palestinians, including displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there had been a “tragic mistake” and that Israel was investigating. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas , with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel said it was looking into the civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. In a speech before Israel’s parliament on Monday, Netanyahu said that “despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake. We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers “pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. The Gaza Health Ministry said around half of the dead were women, children and older adults. On Monday, barefoot children poked at the blackened debris as searches continued. France, a close European ally of Israel, said it was “outraged” by the violence. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said bombings like the one in Rafah will have long-standing repercussions for Israel. “Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,′′ he told Italy's SKY TG24 news channel. Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the strikes could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strikes. Egypt's Foreign Ministry described the strike on Tel al-Sultan as a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "description": "The boohoo share price has seen a rocky few years, but with signs that the economy is improving, could this be a buying opportunity?The post Potentially 34% undervalued, should I be watching the boohoo share price? appeared first on The Motley Fool UK.",
        "content": "( ), the online fashion giant known for its trendy styles and targeted marketing, has experienced a roller-coaster ride in recent years. Once a darling of the stock market, the boohoo share price has plummeted over 20% in the last year alone. But is this a sign of a sinking ship, or a buying opportunity for savvy investors? What’s going on? Analysts are divided. While the company has undoubtedly faced challenges, some see reasons to make this a stock well worth watching. boohoo’s recent woes can be attributed to a confluence of factors. In November 2023, the company issued a profit warning, citing a slowdown in consumer spending and rising costs. The primary demographic, young adults aged 16 to 45, were reportedly feeling the pinch of inflation and were cutting back on discretionary spending like clothing. Furthermore, the fast-fashion industry itself has seen some other major headwinds in recent years. Consumers are becoming more environmentally conscious and are shifting towards sustainable clothing options, away from fast fashion. Boohoo’s business model, built on mass production of trendy garments at low costs, might not resonate as strongly with this new wave of eco-conscious shoppers. As a result, the share price has plummeted over 85% in the last five years. Signs of hope Despite the current gloom, there are reasons to be cautiously optimistic. Firstly, analysts predict annual earnings growth of a whopping 80% over the coming years. Admittedly, there still aren’t any signs of profit for the foreseeable, but a long-term investor may be rewarded if this trend can continue. Secondly, the company is adept at using social media and influencer marketing to reach its target audience. In the ever-evolving retail landscape, this could be a massive growth area. The third, and most interesting factor to me is the potential valuation. A calculation suggests the firm is about 34% undervalued. Although this isn’t a guarantee, with this much potential, I’d consider some more digging into the well worth doing. At present, debt levels seem to be under control. Also, there is a solid reserve of cash available, but as the sector has seen in the past, such resources can disappear very quickly in the wrong environment. Risks remain Before jumping on the bandwagon, it’s important to acknowledge there are still plenty of concerns that have dogged the company in recent years. There have been accusations of poor working conditions in its supply chain. These controversies can damage the firm’s reputation and seriously alienate consumers who value ethical practices. Moreover, boohoo faces stiff competition from established players like and emerging rivals like PrettyLittleThing. The online fashion market is crowded, and boohoo will need to innovate and adapt to stay ahead of the curve. Am I buying? The potential upside in the boohoo share price is certainly enticing. But it’s important to remember that this is just a calculation, and the stock price could easily go down further. For long-term investors who believe in the firm’s ability to overcome its challenges and adapt to the changing retail landscape, then the current share price might be an attractive entry point. However, I still don’t have much confidence that these can be resolved any time soon. I’ll be staying well clear for now.",

        "content": "Bill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71 Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. 14-time champion Rafael Nadal loses in the French Open's first round to Alexander Zverev PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That's why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he isn't 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. He reiterated that Monday. He said after his match, \"If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself.” Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. Kyle Larson's bid to run The Double ends in disappointment after bad weather intervenes CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only the single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s goal to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday and join Tony Stewart as only drivers to complete all 1,100 laps did not go nearly as planned. He finished 18th at Indianapolis after a pair of rookie mistakes. He arrived in Charlotte to run the NASCAR race but never got to turn a lap after the race was ended early because of rain. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving each score 33 points as Mavs beat Wolves for 3-0 lead in West finals DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving scored 33 points apiece and the Dallas Mavericks made all the big plays late again, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-107 for a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference finals. The Mavericks went on a 14-3 run to finish the game, winning their fifth consecutive playoff game. No team in NBA playoff history has rallied from 3-0 down. Game 4 is Tuesday night in Dallas. Anthony Edwards had 26 points for the Wolves, but just four after scoring eight consecutive Minnesota points to get the Wolves even in the third quarter. Braves' Ronald Acuña is placed on IL after second season-ending knee injury in 4 years ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves have placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list after the reigning NL MVP tore his left ACL, ending his season. Acuña was hurt during the Braves’ 8-1 win at Pittsburgh on Sunday. The Braves announced Sunday night an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require surgery. Acuña tore his right ACL in July 2021. Acuña was voted the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases. Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris played Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev and lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. Wennberg scores in OT, Rangers top Panthers 5-4 to take lead in East finals SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Alex Wennberg deflected home a goal 5:35 into overtime, and the New York Rangers reclaimed home-ice advantage in the Eastern Conference finals with a 5-4 win over the Florida Panthers in Game 3 on Sunday. Ryan Lindgren took a shot from the left point and Wennberg — in front of the Florida net — redirected it past Sergei Bobrovsky to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead in the series. Igor Shesterkin made 33 stops, while Alexis Lafrenière scored two goals and Barclay Goodrow continued his surprising playoff barrage with two more scores for the Rangers. Sam Reinhart had two power-play goals, while Aleksander Barkov and Gustav Forsling also scored for the Panthers. Christopher Bell wins the rain-shortened Coca-Cola 600 for his 8th NASCAR Cup victory CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Christopher Bell won the Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday at Charlotte Motor Speedway after the race was called with 151 laps remaining in a race that was halted for more than two hours because of rain. Bell led a race-high 90 laps to win his eighth career Cup Series race, and his first Coca-Cola 600. Brad Keselowski finished second, William Byron was third, Tyler Reddick was fourth and Denny Hamlin rounded out the top five. The race was red-flagged just as Kyle Larson arrived at Charlotte Motor Speedway from the Indianapolis 500 to take over driving the Hendrick Motorsports’ No. 5 Chevrolet. As Dallas competes for NBA and NHL crowns, the Texas Rangers are struggling with their title defense The Texas Rangers host the Arizona Diamondbacks this week in a rematch of last year’s World Series. Both teams are under .500, costing the matchup some of its luster. For the Rangers, injuries to prominent starting pitchers are just part of the problem. Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer haven’t pitched at all this year. Nathan Eovaldi and Jon Gray are on the injured list now as well. Despite all that, Texas’ starters have an ERA of 3.65. But the bullpen has the second-worst ERA in the game at 5.09.",

Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris played Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev and lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. Wennberg scores in OT, Rangers top Panthers 5-4 to take lead in East finals SUNRISE, Fla.

Christopher Bell wins the rain-shortened Coca-Cola 600 for his 8th NASCAR Cup victory CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Christopher Bell won the Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday at Charlotte Motor Speedway after the race was called with 151 laps remaining in a race that was halted for more than two hours because of rain. Bell led a race-high 90 laps to win his eighth career Cup Series race, and his first Coca-Cola 600. Brad Keselowski finished second, William Byron was third, Tyler Reddick was fourth and Denny Hamlin rounded out the top five. The race was red-flagged just as Kyle Larson arrived at Charlotte Motor Speedway from the Indianapolis 500 to take over driving the Hendrick Motorsports’ No. 5 Chevrolet. As Dallas competes for NBA and NHL crowns, the Texas Rangers are struggling with their title defense The Texas Rangers host the Arizona Diamondbacks this week in a rematch of last year’s World Series. Both teams are under .500, costing the matchup some of its luster. For the Rangers, injuries to prominent starting pitchers are just part of the problem. Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer haven’t pitched at all this year. Nathan Eovaldi and Jon Gray are on the injured list now as well. Despite all that, Texas’ starters have an ERA of 3.65. But the bullpen has the second-worst ERA in the game at 5.09.",

        "description": "Turkish capital hosts ‘Hamas festival,’ with clerics and political leaders praising the October 7 massacre and openly expressing anti-Jewish bigotry.",
        "content": "Sami Al-Arian, an academic deported from the US a couple of decades ago after pleading guilty to providing services to the (PIJ), shared a stage in a panel discussion with a high-ranking member of the terror organization Hamas, Jamal Issa, during a conference held in Istanbul last week. The conference was titled “The Flood of the Free” as a homage to Hamas’s October 7 massacre, named by the radical terror group “Flood of Al-Aqsa,” with the conference logo featuring two paragliders referring to the terrorists who on their bloodthirsty quest to murder, rape and kidnap over 1200 Israelis and foreigners on October 7. Other also took part in other sessions during the two-day event, including Osama Hamdan, Sami Abu Zuhri, as well as Khaled Meshaal, who sent a pre-recorded blessing to the conference. The main host of the event was the Global Campaign to Support Al-Quds and Palestine (GCQP), an Istanbul-based organization pertaining to the Muslim Brotherhood axis, with close organizational and ideological ties to the Al-Quds Foundation, designated as a Hamas proxy by both the US and Israel. Other hosts included Turkish NGO “Human and Civilization Movement,” as well as the Al-Baraka Society, a charity organization led by Algerian Muslim Brotherhood cleric Ahmed Brahimi. According to the organizers, the conference saw participation of hundreds of people from dozens of countries, from Pakistan to Yemen to Morocco. Several speakers in the conference expressed openly antisemitic views, including Mohammad Ibrahim, preacher at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron, who denounced “the Jews among the Arabs” and pointed at the Talmud as a motivation for the “burning of Gaza;” as well as Iraqi Sheikh Waleed Al-Husseini who praised Iraq’s struggle “against the Jews” ever since the time of Nebuchadnezzar, also praising the missiles shot by Saddam Hussein at Israel during the first Gulf War. Likewise, former justice minister of Mauritius, Rama Valayden, claimed that Israel “only understands the language of money,” calling to boycott international firms such as McDonald's, KFC, Coca-Cola, and even Head & Shoulders, alleging that they “support the Israeli army and Netanyahu.” A similar event was held one day later, as another Istanbul-based Islamist organization named the Palestine Scholars Association (PSA) held a conference titled “The Nation's Religious Scholars and the Flood of the Free,” which saw the participation of Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk. Notedly, PSA itself is led by Nawaf Takrouri, named a member of Hamas’s founding generation, who was deported by Israel in 1993 on the backdrop of his ties to the radical terror organization. The event saw participation of Muslim Brotherhood-oriented Islamist clerics from different countries. During the event, Abu Marzouk praised “mosques, the Quran, and Jihad” as the three reasons behind “Gaza’s triumph,” adding that “Jihad is not limited to weapons, but rather jihad is an obligation in our day, each in his specialty, work, and place.” According to Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated channels, the conference concluded with ten suggestions for action among scholars as part of the efforts to “support the flood [of Al-Aqsa],” including strengthening jihadi education, applying pressure on governments, enhancing Da’wah (‘call to Islam’ or religious preaching) through online platforms for the youth, and spreading “Qur’anic messages related to victory and love for Al-Aqsa.” Other suggestions included learning from Hamas, whose model was initiated by an Islamist religious scholar, supporting Palestinians in arenas involved in combating Israel, reviving jurisprudence of jihad and jihadi education while “drawing inspiration from the positions of our people’s jihad in Gaza and Palestine,” and promoting economic boycott of “the enemy.” Türkiye has long been a staunch supporter of Hamas, hosting the terror group’s leaders on many occasions and providing material and moral support to the radical Islamist group. Both Erdogan’s AKP party and the Palestinian terror organization have their ideological roots in what is named “political Islam” or Islamism, led worldwide by the Muslim Brotherhood axis. This ideology, amplified and promoted by religious institutions, political parties, and NGOs across the globe and usually backed by Qatar and Türkiye, aspires to establish its own version of Islam as the main focal point of personal and political identities. The Muslim Brotherhood is also the ideological predecessor of Salafi Jihadist movements such as Al-Qaeda and ISIS, and many scholars attribute the movement with the trickling of classical European antisemitic tropes into the Arab and Islamic sphere. through translations and adaptations of antisemitic texts.",

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. While Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site. Monday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2009, and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately. “To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,” he explained, “you need to be playing often.” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” This story has been corrected to fix the year of Nadal's loss to Soderling. It was 2009, not 2010. AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

        "description": "Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal...",
        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. While Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site. Monday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately. “To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,” he explained, “you need to be playing often.” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

The exact recovery period for the 33-year-old has not yet been disclosed, but the player himself has confirmed that the Euros will come too soon. “I can’t imagine I’ve had a week in my career, or in my life, that has had so many ups and downs.

        "content": "Controversial musician, Habeeb Okikiola, popularly known as Portable, has declared himself police ambassador a few days after causing a stir while evading arrest by police officers. Portable made this known in a post on his Instagram page, where he shared photos of himself with his father and other high-ranking officers in the Lagos police headquarters on Tuesday evening. Portable, his father, and other high-ranking police officers at police headquarters in Lagos State. The Zazoo crooner regained his freedom the following day after being arrested for incurring a debt on the Mercedes Benz GLE he bought from a car dealer in Lagos. The singer further went to his social media page to explain what transpired between him and the car dealer, alleging that he had spent more than required on the vehicle because it was faulty. Portable, his father, and other high-ranking police officers are at police headquarters in Lagos State. Meanwhile, reaffirming his relationship with the police, he announced that he is now a police ambassador while adopting the oft-used phrase – ‘Police is your friend’. He wrote, “ZAzuu Federal Government liability. Ọmọ ijoba Police Ambassador. I do music for a living ....Star don’t beg to shine. Akoi Grace Wey No Dey disgrace.

No one does it better.” Recall that after spending 24 hours in custody, the “Zazuu” crooner shared a snippet of his new song – “Spiderman” in response to his arrest for defaulting on the payment plan for his car. Produced by 2tuponthebeat, the song alludes to the singer’s flying power, referencing how he jumped over a gate to evade arrest. Portable The incident was captured in a video that circulated on Tuesday. The singer, dressed in a white and black stripe shirt, stood alongside eight other people and was seen climbing over a nearby gate before taking to his heels.",

        "content": "CARDIFF: England’s white-ball captain Jos Buttler is likely to miss the third T20I of the four-match series against Pakistan, an international media outlet reported. According to the report, Buttler left for London after spearheading England to a comfortable 23-run victory over Pakistan in the second T20I in Birmingham. The England captain and his wife Louise are expecting the birth of their third child soon. Notably, Jos Buttler was absent from England’s training session in Cardiff on Monday afternoon and is unlikely to feature in the third T20I against Pakistan, scheduled on Tuesday evening. Moreover, it is uncertain whether Buttler will return in time for the final T20I against Pakistan but as things stand he is most likely to accompany the England squad on their departure for the West Indies for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 on Friday. Earlier, England’s vice-captain Moeen Ali, who has led the side in 12 ODIs and T20Is, stated that nothing will change if he assumes the England captaincy role in Jos Buttler’s absence. “I feel I’ve captained enough for England,” Moeen said. “I’ll be fine. Nothing will change too much, it’s just taking over from what he’s doing and then when he comes back, he takes over. “Hopefully, the baby comes at the right time where he doesn’t miss too many games. “For me, it’s just whatever will happen, will happen. It’s not really difficult, to be honest with you, because we speak often, me and Jos. We talk about other things, the team and all that. We’re on the same page anyway.” Pakistan squad: Babar Azam (c), Abrar Ahmed, Azam Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Iftikhar Ahmed, Imad Wasim, Mohammad Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Rizwan, Muhammad Irfan Khan, Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha, Shadab Khan, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Usman Khan.

Joshua Clipperton, The Canadian Press May 27, 2024 12:22 PM Share by Email Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Print Share via Text Message Edmonton Oilers' Adam Henrique (19) celebrates a goal against the Arizona Coyotes during NHL action in Edmonton on Friday April 12, 2024. The veteran centre will be in the lineup tonight when his Oilers take on the Dallas Stars in Game 3 of the Western Conference final, head coach Kris Knoblauch said. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jason Franson EDMONTON — Adam Henrique is set to join the action. Roope Hintz might be doing the same. Henrique will return to the lineup Monday when his Edmonton Oilers take on the Dallas Stars in Game 3 of the Western Conference final, head coach Kris Knoblauch said. Dallas counterpart Pete DeBoer added Hintz is a game-time decision. The Oilers and Stars are tied 1-1 in the best-of-seven series after Dallas picked up a 3-1 home victory Saturday. Edmonton took the opener 3-2 in double overtime. Henrique suffered a suspected ankle injury in Game 5 of the first round against the Los Angeles Kings before briefly returning for Game 2 against the Vancouver Canucks. \"It's more nerve-racking watching than playing,\" the 34-year-old centre said Thursday morning. \"But watching the guys, seeing everybody come together and push through and battle, it was certainly great to watch, and see the team continue to get better. \"You're just itching to be a part of that.\" Acquired from the Anaheim Ducks ahead of the NHL trade deadline, Henrique has a goal and an assist in six playoff appearances this spring. Projected to play on a line with Warren Foegele and Derek Ryan, he combined to score 24 goals and 51 points in the regular season. Oilers forward Ryan McLeod will be a healthy scratch. Hintz, the Stars' No. 1 centre, hasn't played since suffering an upper-body injury in Game 4 of the second round against the Colorado Avalanche. The 27-year-old, who took part in an optional morning skate Thursday, has two goals and four assists in 11 playoff games. He put up 30 goals and 65 points in 80 regular-season contests. \"He's just an awesome player,\" Stars centre Wyatt Johnston said. \"He's one of the best players in the in the world. You can't really replace a guy like that. \"Being able to get him back, it would be huge.\" McLeod comes out of Edmonton's lineup without a point in 14 playoff games. The 24-year-old has been part of an Oilers' penalty kill that has gone 20 straight short-handed opportunities without giving up a goal. Knoblauch compared McLeod taking a seat to the \"reset\" the team gave goaltender Stuart Skinner in Games 4 and 5 of the Vancouver series. \"There's a lot to like about his game,\" said the coach. \"A lot of it is from the penalty kill. He's been contributing a lot there with his quickness, his reads. Five-on-five, he hasn't been playing quite like he had been — especially around the middle part of the season. \"We've got a lot of players that are playing well. It's been difficult to take anybody out of the lineup.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. Joshua Clipperton, The Canadian Press See a typo/mistake?

        "content": "TALAMBAH: A shocking incident was reported from Tulamba area of Punjab where two orphan sisters were violently assaulted and had their fingers burned for allegedly stealing books from the madrasa, ARY News reported on Monday. The mother of the victim girls claimed accused that the individuals, named Mudassir and Maqsood along with others tortured her daughters, adding that the girls were taken to a tent, tied with ropes, and hung. She claims that the assailants later handed both her and the girls over to the police. “The police released me and my daughters on the guarantee of non-medical examination,” the mother claimed. The mother has accused the authorities of neglect and insists that a medical examination and justice for her daughters are necessary. She also stated that the girls have been barred from receiving any medical or psychological support following the trauma. DSP Saleem Rath confirmed that the girls were accused of stealing books from a madarssa and passing them to someone else. He mentioned that the incident occurred a few days ago and assured that he is currently investigating the case. DSP Rath promised a transparent inquiry, emphasizing that no one will be allowed to take the law into their own hands.",

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDiscover how the three bargain stocks operating in oil and gas transportation and financial sectors can turbocharge the portfolio's growth.The post 3 Bargain Stocks Ready to Supercharge Your Wealth appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "One should look for hidden jewels in the stock market, which provide stability and development possibilities. Three businesses have stood out in this endeavor; each represents a different industry — banking, insurance and energy. They are all united by opportunity and perseverance. The first one excels in the energy field, namely in gas and oil transportation. Growing Time Charter Equivalent (TCE) rates indicate that geopolitical concerns and an aging tanker fleet have driven the company’s market performance. Meanwhile, the second one deftly negotiates the complex world of insurance. The company has maintained policyholders in the face of substantial premium hikes and enhanced the performance of its Property & Casualty (P&C) sector by implementing a methodical plan for profitability restoration. Finally, with strong financial indicators, the third one commands respect in regional banking. Strategic balance sheet expansion is the foundation for its strong performance, as seen by its earnings per share ( EPS ), return on equity and net interest income. Overall, these businesses offer more than just financial prospects. They are examples of resilience against volatile markets. Frontline (FRO) Frontline (NYSE: FRO ) has already secured 72% of Suezmax days at $52,800 per day, 69% of Aframax (LR2) days at an exceptional $67,800 per day, and 81% of Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) days at an average TCE cost of $55,100 per day for the first quarter of 2024 (in Q4 2023). These rising rates are load-to-discharge-based and the number of ballast days may impact them. Moreover, the tanker business is significantly affected ton-mile by the heightened tensions in the Middle East and the interruptions in the Red Sea/Aden area . Additionally, the United States is putting more pressure on Russia’s price cap evasions and the so-called Dark Fleet. Due to economies of scale, bigger boats such as VLCCs are preferred in the expanding trading lanes as non-OPEC oil output rises, especially from the U.S. and Brazil. Finally, with 133 VLCCs scheduled to reach 20 years old in 2024 alone, a sizable portion of the fleet’s current age is nearing or beyond 20. The Suezmax fleet has a comparable pattern. Thus, the aging fleet and rising ordering activity indicate a probable decrease in available tonnage, which might compress supply and justify higher prices. Horace Mann (HMN) Horace Mann ‘s (NYSE: HMN ) notable advancements in the P&C sector are one of its main advantages. Compared to Q1 2023, the P&C combined ratio increased by 13 points to 99.9% in Q1 2024. The combined ratio is the percentage of the premiums an insurer collects that it pays out in claims and expenses, before counting its profits from investing those premiums. This improvement shows that the segment’s cost control and efficiency have improved. The segment’s $11 million profit represented a substantial improvement over the previous year’s deficit and showed the value of the company’s multi-year profitability restoration plan. Additionally, Horace Mann projects overall premium increases in cars and property of around 40% and 50% , respectively, from 2022 to 2024. This calculated action aims to increase profitability. Further, the policyholder retention has stayed the same despite these significant premium hikes, indicating consumer loyalty and contentment with the value offered by the business. Thus, the steady retention rates in the face of increasing premiums demonstrate the efficacy of Horace Mann’s client retention techniques. Further, Q1 catastrophe losses were higher than the 10-year and five-year norms . However, they were less than 2023 on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Overall, the resilience and effectiveness of the company’s claims management practices are demonstrated by its fundamental ability to manage higher catastrophic losses while increasing the consolidated bottom line. Columbia Banking System (COLB) Columbia Banking System (NASDAQ: COLB ) delivered operational EPS of $0.65 and $0.59 for Q1 2024. The company uses equity capital effectively, reflected in the operational return of 16% for tangible equity on average, reflecting its high returns to shareholders. Further, Q1’s net interest income of $423 million represented a $30 million decline from the prior quarter. This is mostly due to increased deposit expenses and decreased revenue from investment securities. Despite this drop, the net interest margin (NIM) was 3.52% , falling between the predicted range of 3.45% and 3.60%. Notably, price reductions on wholesale and promotional funding caused the NIM to rise to 3.55% in March. Thus, this demonstrates successful margin management in a challenging environment for interest rates. Lastly, for Q1, Columbia Banking System saw growth in deposits of $100 million and loans of $200 million. After declining in January, non-sparing demand deposits stabilized in February and March , indicating a stabilizing deposit base. Thus, it is evident that the company’s main strength that supports its expansion plan is its capacity to increase its balance sheet. As of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in HMN and COLB. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines .",

Police say they've laid a total of 322 charges so far and have issued arrest warrants for 10 more people. They say the seven-month investigation, called Project Odyssey, recovered 255 vehicles in Peel Region and 114 vehicles at the Port of Montreal, where the cars were intended for export. Police say a Peel-based company was helping to transport stolen vehicles out of a trucking yard in Brampton, Ont. The force says that last year, more than 8,300 vehicles were reported stolen in Peel Region, making it the highest in Ontario for per-capita auto thefts. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. The Canadian Press",

        "description": "A roundup of crime news from around the Lower Mainland and B.C. on Monday, May 27",
        "content": "Article content A North Vancouver man is facing charges after a knife-wielding man damaged several cars in Deep Cove over the weekend, then went after a motorcyclist with the weapon. North Vancouver RCMP were called about a man reportedly slashing cars near Deep Cove Road and Mount Seymour Parkway, not far from The Raven pub in the District of North Vancouver, at about 3 p.m. Saturday. “It is alleged the man was carrying a knife and using it to damage cars,” said Const. Mansoor Sahak in a news release on Monday. “The man then allegedly attacked a motorcyclist, striking his helmet with the knife, but fortunately, causing no injury. “The motorcyclist did sustain minor injuries as a result of falling, and was led to safety by a motorist at the scene.” Officers flooded the scene within minutes and arrested a suspect. Police allege the suspect assaulted an officer while in custody. North Van District Mayor Mike Little went to the scene on Saturday. “Deep Cove is a very safe area so this violent act comes as a complete shock,” said Little in a text exchange on Monday. “This could have been much more serious if it wasn’t for the quick thinking of a bystander who protected the victim in their car, and also thanks to the RCMP for their quick action.” On Sunday, prosecutors charged Alexander Currie with attempted murder, assault with a weapon, uttering threats, mischief, assault of a police officer and weapon possession. “The quick actions of our officers led to the safe arrest of the suspect,” said Sahak. “We would like to thank the quick-thinking actions of a passerby motorist who assisted the motorcyclist by guiding them to safety.” Sahak said the RCMP victim services unit is available 24/7 for anyone struggling emotionally by calling 604-969-7540. Witnesses who haven’t spoken to police are asked to call 604-985-1311. Richmond RCMP are hoping witnesses have dashcam footage after a traffic cop was forced to leap out of the way to avoid being hit by a speeding car last week. A road safety unit was cracking down on speeders on Highway 91 near the Knight Street Bridge on May 19 when an officer allegedly clocked a vehicle going 145 km/h in an 80 km zone. The officer on foot tried to stop the vehicle, but it didn’t stop and the Mountie had to dive to the side of the road to avoid getting hit. “Fortunately, our officer was not seriously injured, but this type of driving behaviour puts all road users at risk,” said Sgt. Eric Baskette of the road safety unit. Investigators are asking anyone who was in the area between 8:40 and 9:10 a.m. to check dashcam footage. The suspect was in a black sedan with a broken passenger-side mirror that was last seen headed east on Highway 91. Anyone with information or video is asked to call Richmond RCMP at 604-278-1212 or Crime Stoppers, 1-800-222-8477, or make a report at . A man wanted for assault and drug charges in Surrey and Langley who missed a court date in February is in custody. Surrey RCMP say Arandeep Gill, 34, failed to show up in court on Feb. 9 to face eight charges including assault and assault with a weapon. He was also wanted on three charges in Langley for possession of drugs for trafficking purposes and dangerous operation of a vehicle. Gill was arrested at a home in the 10400-block of University Drive late Sunday afternoon by Surrey RCMP, an integrated emergency response team, crisis negotiators, police dogs and a gang enforcement team. He is in custody until a remand hearing.",

        "content": "He emphasized the need for assistance from both the Federal Government and Edo State Government to address the banditry disrupting their operations. Hefer underscored the significance of rubber production for the company’s operations, citing it as a major source of foreign exchange earnings. However, he lamented the production losses incurred due to insecurity, highlighting that attacks compelled them to cease rubber farming, consequently impacting their commitments. In addition to security challenges, Hefer identified currency devaluation, forex scarcity, and inadequate infrastructure as further obstacles affecting the company. He also flagged government policies such as multiple taxation as significant hurdles. Expressing hope for governmental intervention to mitigate these challenges and enhance business performance, Hefer mentioned that the company currently has no immediate expansion plans unless directed otherwise by the board. In a related development, recent attacks on Okomu Oil Palm’s facility resulted in casualties among the company’s staff. A militant group claiming responsibility demanded a 25% stake in the company and a directorship position on its board. The broader issue of insecurity in Nigeria, extending beyond the North-East region, has impacted various sectors, including agriculture. Reports suggest that farmers across Northern Nigeria pay bandits for access to their farms to avoid harvest losses, contributing to elevated food inflation nationwide.

Yolanda Mays and her uncle, Tommy Holmes, claim on the evening of March 21, 2023, Minneapolis Police Officers Andrew Schroeder and Mark Suchta as well as Brooklyn Center Police Officer Alan Salvosa without permission . The reason for their presence on the scene in the first place was to investigate the fatal shooting of a woman. A search warrant affidavit listed as a residence on the same block but not that belonging to Ms. Mays and Mr. Holmes, the suit says. Alas, . Holmes was home at the time but in the basement. The suit alleges the police trio began shuffling through the mailbox while awaiting a response from someone inside the home. Eventually, the suit claims they began peering through the window where they discovered a baby doll lying on the couch. The group then drew up the conclusion that the doll - with apparent “stitched on joints and plastic sheen” - was not indeed a doll but instead a real infant in distress that needed saving, the suit claims. Once their minds were made, they kicked in the front door. Read more from : The suit alleges Officer Salvosa caused damage to the home and garage during the midst of his search.

Apparently, this is also the latest mess these cops in particular have been dragged in. The lawsuit got , you hear me? The suit cited up to 20 disciplinary matters Officer Schroeder has faced alone since 2015 for conducting none other than unlawful searches. In 2020, he was accused of fabricating where he received a tip from in a drug investigation, the report says. The suit also came for Officer Salvosa’s record, explaining he was sued following a 2015 incident where he deployed a Taser at someone who died later. The suit seeks an unspecified amount of monetary damages, arguing that the officers acted with “evil intent” and “reckless indifference” of the civil rights of both Mr. Holmes and Ms. Mays. It’s unclear if the officers faced any disciplinary action following the incident or the lawsuit filing.",

Wolf 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 in the first round. “It's still in my mind, but I didn’t feel anything after the match ... which is really, really good for me.” Four-time Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka won a match at a major for the first time in more than two years by defeating Lucia Bronzetti 1-6, 6-4, 7-5, to advance to what could be a second-round showdown against Swiatek. Other players moving into the second round included Caroline Garcia of France, 2020 Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin, No. 30 Dayana Yastremska and Donna Vekic in the women's draw, and No. 6 Andrey Rublev, No. 8 Hubert Hurkacz and No. 10 Grigor Dimitrov in the men's. No. 17 seed Ugo Humbert was eliminated by Lorenzo Sonego 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3. There was a brief rain shower in the afternoon, which delayed action on several courts but allowed for the first use of the new retractable roof at Court Suzanne Lenglen. How to Watch the French Open on TV — In the U.S.: Tennis Channel, NBC, Peacock. — Other countries are listed here . Betting Guide Nadal is usually favored to win the championship at the French Open — he has 14, after all — but BetMGM Sportsbook has him as the underdog in the first round against No. 4 seed Zverev on Monday. Zverev is a -350 money-line favorite against Nadal, who is listed at +260 for that match. Nadal is just 7-4 this year and missed nearly all of last year while dealing with injuries; that is why he is unseeded and so could have been drawn to face anyone to begin the tournament. Zverev was a semifinalist in Paris each of the past three years and is coming off a clay-court title at the Italian Open this month. Swiatek is a big favorite to win the title (-155), so it makes sense that she is listed at -10000 against Jeanjean, who has +1600 money-line odds for their match.

        "content": "Timipre Sylva, the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa State and former Minister of State, Petroleum, Timipre Sylva, has rejected the Bayelsa State Governorship Election Tribunal judgement which upheld the election of Douye Diri as the state governor. Dissatisfied with the tribunal’s judgement, Sylva held a closed-door meeting with elders and stakeholders of the party to discuss the next course of action. After the meeting, he directed his legal team to seek justice at the Court of Appeal. “We are not satisfied with the decision of the tribunal. But this is just a court of first instance and after meeting with the elders and critical stakeholders of our great party, the APC, we directed our legal team to seek justice for Bayelsa at the Supreme Court.” Sylva also assured the people of Bayelsa that the court of appeal would surely correct the travesty perpetrated by the tribunal. According to him, the liberation of Bayelsa was close, adding that justice was inevitable for the traumatized people of the state. Read also: Breaking: Kano court orders police to evict Bayero from palace He appealed to them to remain positive, law-abiding, and steadfast. Sylva had in the course of the sitting of the tribunal accused the tribunal of bias following several infractions observed by his lawyers during the hearing of the case. Though he subsequently filed an interlocutory appeal demanding the dissolution of the panel and reconstitution of a new one, his petition was thrown out by the President of the Court of Appeal. It will be recalled that the tribunal had earlier upheld the election that produced Diri as the state governor. A three-man panel led by Justice Adekunle Adeleye dismissed the petition filed by Sylva, and the APC for lacking merit.

        "description": "Yellowstone prequel 1923 will be back for a second outing but an update has left some feeling saddened.",
        "content": "Yellowstone spinoff 1923 season two is on its way with fans to expect a big change following an update. Starring Hollywood icons Helen Mirren and Harrison Ford, 1923 follows in the footsteps of fellow spin-off 1883 which starred Tim McGraw and Faith Hill. In 1923, the focus is on the Dutton family in the late 19th century as they made their way from Texas to Montana, struggling to survive the drought, prohibition and cattle theft. Kevin Costner told Yellowstone writers to 'kill me' after explosive feud How much does the Yellowstone cast make? Salary breakdown as new season begins filming The first series on Paramount+ went down a storm with subscribers so it wasn’t too much of a surprise when it was renewed for a second season. However, this new series is going to look different from the first after its creators gave an update on shooting the Western drama. 1923 season two is going to be swapping Montana for a new filming location in South Austin, Texas. The show is going to be shot at ATX Film Studios, according to Austin Business Journal, even though the majority of season one took place in Bozeman Town, Butte, in Montana. Other scenes were filmed in South Africa, throughout Europe and Tanzania but was predominantly in Montana so it will be a big change. As of yet, it is unclear if other locations beyond Texas are going to be used for 1923’s second season. Don't miss: Yellowstone has begun production and fans can't contain their excitement Yellowstone's Kevin Costner says he wants to shoot series but hasn't seen any scripts Taylor Sheridan shocked Paramount execs when he denied season 2 of 1883 Not everyone is happy with the change in direction that the show’s creators have chosen to go with though. Speaking to the Montana Standard, chief executive of Butte-Silver Bow County JP Gallagher said: \"The decision to film the Yellowstone series of 1923 in Texas is disappointing. \"Nevertheless, we respect the production team's decision and acknowledge that these choices are influenced by factors beyond our control. “We were in talks with the production about 1923 coming back to Butte because of the positive experience they had here, but state tax incentive programs were a major factor for the production to move to Texas.\" So far, details on the new series of 1923 have been few and far between and if the new location is going to impact the plot. It is known that both Mirren and Ford will be reprising their roles as the show’s leads Cara and Jacob Dutton respectively. Filming has not yet started for season two so it is unlikely 1923 will be back before the end of the year. The Yellowstone franchise is available to watch on Paramount+.",

Miranda told exclusively earlier this year that she was when bringing this story to life. “I read a story about people who were doing a home renovation in their backyard, and they found a car just buried there,” the author explained. “They had no idea how long it had been there or how many years it had been there. And it made me start thinking about all the mysteries that might just be existing around us — hidden just under the surface.” When it comes to placing big reveals in her novels, Miranda admits she will “hold back” on certain things to hide it from the reader and keep the story going. “Those reveals allow me to provide a backbone of information that changes the perspective that the readers are seeing,” she added.

        "content": "RUTH Langsford once insisted she wouldn't be friends with an ex in a resurfaced clip, amid her shock split from Eamonn Holmes. The TV couple announced at the weekend that they are divorcing after 14 years of marriage . And now a clip from when Ruth and Eamonn, both 64, presented This Morning has revealed how she really feels about keeping in touch with former partners. While Eamonn said: \"It's easier to stay friends.\" But Ruth replied: \"Why would you need to stay friends? You aren't with them anymore, you don't need to be friends. \"My thing is you weren't just friends, you were married or had a relationship.\" Another forgotten interview from the pandemic saw Eamonn confess he and Ruth \"needed space\" from each other. In a joint interview with TalkTV host Kevin O'Sullivan, Eamonn admitted that the only time the pair really interacted was when they were working together. He said at the time: \"Although we live together, we're not really together, we don't watch the same TV, Ruth likes her own space, when we do This Morning it's a rare time we actually interrelate.\" Today it was reported that Ruth \"orchestrated\" her split from Eamonn , with him \"refusing\" to sign off on their joint statement. It’s believed Ruth was the one who OK’ed the simple statement, with Eamonn wanting no part in it. The Daily Mail claims Eamonn ‘told friends he didn’t want to get involved’ and ‘Ruth could do what she wants but keep him out of it’. The statement eventually simply read: “Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes have confirmed their marriage is over and they are in the process of divorcing.” While sources have said they are ‘dedicated to making the split amicable’, Eamonn has already left the family home for a property nearby. The couple have one son together, 22-year-old Jack. Before the shock split announcement, Ruth and Eamonn seemed like one of the strongest couples on UK TV – even with their signature bickering style. Here's how their romance played out 1997 - The couple first meet after being introduced by mutual friends, two years after Eamonn splits from his first wife, Gabrielle, with whom he has three children. 1997-2002 - To be respectful to Gabrielle, the couple kept their relationship out of the limelight. Ruth told Daily Mail : \"I thought it spoke volumes about the sort of man he was, the sort of father he was and the integrity he had. It made me love him more, not less.\" 2002 - Ruth and Eamonn welcome their son, Jack, to the family 2005 - Eamonn finalises his divorce with Gabrielle 2006 - The pair begin to host Friday episodes of This Morning together 2010 - Eamonn proposes to Ruth while at the Cheltenham Races, after asking Ruth's mother for her hand June 2010 - Eamonn and Ruth marry at Elvetham Hall, Hampshire 2016 - Eamonn undergoes a double hip replacement in the first of many health battles. June 2019 - On This Morning, Ruth and Eamonn say the secret to their happy marriage. Eamonn credits \"compromise, consideration and lots of conjugals,\" while Ruth said it was \"laughter and an equal marriage\" November 2020 - Ruth and Eamonn are replaced on their regular Friday slot by Alison Hammond and Dermot O'Leary in a 'show shake-up' December 202 1 - After a year of being moved to the bank holiday presenting slot, both Eamonn and Ruth left This Morning January 2022 - Eamonn makes his debut on GB News, while Ruth stayed with ITV in her long-standing role on Loose Women. September 2022 - Eamonn undergoes spinal surgery after years of back issues including a trapped sciatic nerve. November 2022 - Eamonn falls down the stairs of his Surrey home with Ruth and breaks his shoulder, requiring a new operation September 2023 - Eamonn has a spine and neck stretching procedure as part of his year-long recovery May 2024 - Ruth and Eamonn announce they have split after 14 years of marriage and 27 year relationship",

Obviously, you can give your kids your login and they can play your games under your account, but if you wanted to legally transfer your games to a loved one after you pass on, there is no real way to do it. This issue extends to digital movie purchases, music, apps and other software that you can only use within one app. Basically, if you can’t find the source file and move it around easily, you don’t own the program in perpetuity — just a license for it.

        "content": "France’s President Emmanuel Macron on Monday raised the alarm over the “ill wind” of the rise of the far right in European politics, during a state visit to Germany ahead of key EU elections. Macron noted a “fascination with authoritarian regimes” in Europe, singling out Viktor Orban’s government in Hungary for criticism. “Everywhere in our democracies these ideas thrive, pushed by the extremes and in particular the far right,” Macron said in a speech in the eastern city of Dresden, a bastion of support for Germany’s far right. “This ill wind is blowing in Europe, so let us wake up,” he said in front of the city’s famous Frauenkirche church. Macron’s trip comes two weeks ahead of European Union elections in which polls are indicating his centrist coalition is trailing the far right. It could even struggle to reach a third-place finish. Macron, undertaking the first state visit by a French president to Germany in a quarter of a century, made a plea for the defence of democracy against nationalist forces as he arrived on Sunday. In Germany too, all three parties in Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s coalition are polling behind the far-right AfD in surveys, despite a series of scandals embroiling the anti-immigration party. – ‘New responsibility’ – “Europe is not just a place where we give ourselves common rules, it is a set of values,” Macron said. “We must find the strength and commitment to defend it everywhere,” he added. Macron also underlined the threat posed by Russian aggression since the invasion of Ukraine, saying Europeans had a “new responsibility” to guarantee peace. Without supporting Ukraine and stopping Russia from imposing the “law of the strongest” on the battlefield, there would be no peace in Europe, Macron said. “In Ukraine, it is your security, our peace that is at stake,” Macron told the Dresden audience. And Europe, he said, must think about “its own defence and security”. The French president repeated a warning that “our Europe could die”. – Holocaust memorial – Earlier, Macron and his wife Brigitte Macron together with the German presidential couple visited the Holocaust memorial in Berlin that commemorates the six million Jews murdered by the Nazis. Accompanying them was Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld and his German wife Beate, who underlined a resurgence of anti-Semitism, fuelled by Israel’s offensive in Gaza following Hamas’s attack on its territory. “It’s very good that the French president is meeting the German president before this monument, especially at a tragic time for the global Jewish community,” said Klarsfeld. The Klarsfelds have faced controversy lately over comments in favour of far-right leader Marine Le Pen, whom they praise for her engagement against anti-Semitism as opposed to her father Jean-Marie Le Pen. Macron on Sunday labelled Le Pen’s National Rally a “threat to Europe”, stressing that he does not see them as “just another party”. The French president however skirted the issue as he presented the Klarsfelds with honours at the French embassy in Berlin to acknowledge their work “opening eyes” to the past and confronting crimes committed under the Nazis. Macron will on Tuesday travel to Muenster in western Germany, where he will be presented with the Westphalian Peace Prize. He will later meet with Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Meseberg, near Berlin, for a joint Franco-German meeting of ministers. Relations between the two leaders have been strained over their attitudes towards Europe and support for Ukraine, with the French president striking a more strident tone against Russia.

        "content": "Beyoncé wasn’t always Queen Bee, according to her mom, Tina Knowles. “She was very shy, and she got bullied a bit,” the Knowles matriarch, 70, said in a video for Vogue , which she shared on Instagram. “But the day that she stood up for someone — she didn’t stand up for herself she stood up for them. I’m getting emotional talking about it. I was just, I couldn’t have been more proud of her.” Tina also discussed her other daughter, Solange, 37, describing her as an “activist.” She later praised Kelly Rowland, whom she has long considered a daughter. The Destiny’s Child alum moved in with the Knowles family as a tween. “Kelly was always this kid that just tried to protect everybody,” Tina said. “I have a memory of her with her best friend Barbara and her being a mediator and just being this little peacemaker.” The fashion designer then captioned the video by gushing about her three daughters. “Each child is different! But all so special. I believe kids are born with their personalities,” she wrote. “My three girls All handled things very differently. Learn their personalities and respect the individuality. “Never compare the negatives , always praise the positive differences and pay attention to the things that you can brag on about them. They love it and it encourages positive behavior.” Knowles is fiercely loyal to her girls. Most recently, she came to the defense of Rowland , who made headlines for scolding a security guard at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival. Start your day with Page Six Daily.

        "content": "Jammu, May 27: The Special Judge for CBI Cases, Jammu Monday convicted two accused, including an investigator on the panel of Oriental Insurance Company (OIC), Jammu and a claimant, in a case related to bogus insurance claims. The quantum of punishment will be pronounced tomorrow i.e., May 28, 2024. According to a spokesperson of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the case was registered by Bureau on April 13, 2007 against the accused, including the duo convicted by the court on Monday (May 27, 2024) on the allegations that these persons entered conspiracy with one another, submitted bogus insurance claims for the dwelling houses reported to be located at Srinagar and which were reported to be gutted in fire during the year 1997-98. “It was further alleged that the accused obtained undue claim to the tune of Rs 9,52,913, approximately from the insurance company i.e., Oriental Insurance Company Limited though no fire incident took place during the relevant period as per the records of J&K Fire and Emergency Services Command, Srinagar,” the CBI spokesperson said. After completion of investigation, a charge-sheet was filed on February 18, 2009. The charge-sheet in relation to false claim in respect of residential building of Satish Chander Wasoori was filed against accused Subhash Saraf, surveyor; Raj Nath Tickoo, investigator; Satish Chander Wasoori, claimant (private person) and Badri Nath Koul, Development Officer, Oriental Insurance Company. Charges were framed on November 16, 2010 against all the accused. The accused Subhash Saraf, surveyor and Badri Nath Koul, Development officer expired during the trial, hence charges against them were abetted, the spokesperson said. After trial, the court held accused R N Tickoo and Satish Chander Wasoori guilty. “CBI examined 32 witnesses and 97 documents in support of the charges which stood the test of trial in the court,” the spokesperson said.",

The status of ongoing criminal investigations was reviewed to ensure timely resolution and justice for victims. Besides, strategies to strengthen community policing and enhance public safety were discussed, with an emphasis on community involvement in maintaining law and order,” a police spokesperson said. During the meeting, the effectiveness of current crime prevention initiatives was assessed to optimize resources and improve outcomes; measures to tackle drug abuse within the district were deliberated, focusing on prevention, rehabilitation and enforcement.

        "content": "Daily Post Nigeria Hashim Suleiman: Sycophancy around leadership; a big bane Home News Politics Metro Entertainment Sport Opinion Hashim Suleiman: Sycophancy around leadership; a big bane Published on May 27, 2024 By Daily Post Staff I was just listening to a programme on television about the ground breaking of the controversial coastal road that should have been an awesome project but for the mismanagement by the sort of individuals that my article of today wishes to describe and I indeed reconfirmed to myself that leadership may not necessarily be the problem but rather the availability of critical helpers and vision carriers even though it is incumbent on leaders to have all it takes to identify true love and fake one. His Excellency, Hope Uzodinma had been called upon to make a remark at this event and he showered encomiums on the President as expected and went to to inform the President that all Nigerian families were elated and happy because their children are benefiting from the Student’s Loan policy of Mr President and I paused owing to my criticality and be like, is this man not speaking about the same Student’s Loan of which the portal for application was launched barely a week or little more before now? You also had a Permanent Secretary by name Kofarmata adorned in his Yoruba cap and venturing into politics and calling to question a need to know questions by opposition and citizens, a critical ingredient of democracy, when did it become mandatory for civil servants to sycophant around a leader instead of itemizing professional tendencies around the workings of the policies of the president? Even though, I ascribed Governor Uzodinma his right to sycophancy as is with every or most Nigerians around power, my greater expectation was for the President to have recognized that was a lie and call him out immediately or afterwards unless of course if anyone was to tell me the President himself was not aware about the level of progress on the Student Loan programme and that would be pathetic and must elicit scare in a 42 years old self because I thought we should have since passed this stage of leaders allowing lies pass by them without identifying them immediately and calling them out for deterrence. All this can confirm in the interim perhaps is President Tinubu is not aware of the granular workings around his major policy statements and how they are being worked to fruition, recall Student Loan was one of those. For Governor Hope Uzodinma himself to boldly lie to the president by way of praises means he’s aware perhaps that indeed the president is not aware about the detailed workings and direction of his government. Such kind of shenanigans have become the bane of leadership from the Goodluck Jonathan era till date, when you see how supporters insist there cannot be criticism of the administrations and that lies must be told to the leader to make a point, in fact a popular rumor had it that different newspapers are printed for the presidents, this narrative was more prominent during the Buhari Presidency. I must also share the Goodluck Jonathan regime episode of me insisting to a confidant of the administration that the President cannot win the north owing to what I see back home and a meeting was conveyed with another northerner like me who worked with the then Vice President and this fellow denied me flat and made me look like a hater, he insisted Goodluck had no problems whatsoever in the north with the likes of Bafarawa, Shekarau etc, people whom I knew had become more of expired politicians at the time owing to the dissent that was developed on Goodluck Jonathan in that region, a lot has changed after all. Story short, this guy’s narrative was over my own and I was sure his sort of narrative held sway at the presidential villa, the rest is history. Go on the X handle today (formerly twitter) and see the conversations, the supporters of ruling parties at the federal or state levels simply disagree for their governments to be criticized, they insist everyone must tell the boss all is well per second and what they foolishly forget is their actions are the ones preventing their own participation in the various governments because who would want to loose attack dogs who can lie and attack everyone for a pot of porridge. It is when the government is under pressure that a need for shakeups can come up which can offer opportunities for those on the sidelines to get involved but their intellectual laziness which in the first instance is the reason they chose sycophancy will not allow them see and know that. Finally, while I agree that a leader may not have the luxury to know everything happening around them but I do know that certain leaders have all it takes to assemble machinery that is well equipped to fetch them the facts and critically examine them to ensure synergy with the ongoings in their administration and that was why in 2022, I had highlighted that those beautiful Asiwaju Tinubu recruits of 1999-2007 themselves do not know how to recruit sound people like them and such is leading to the so many errors and incoherence that is attracting too many bashings on the administration of President Bola Tinubu and I wish anyone could send this narrative to the president.

        "content": "World leaders were urged Monday to keep working toward an unprecedented agreement among nations that would give the World Health Organization (WHO) a stronger voice in fighting the next pandemic. The announcements came after negotiators failed to produce a draft of the agreement by the May 24 deadline, although talks are still ongoing and some form of pact is said to be on the table. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged delegates at the 77th World Health Assembly in Geneva to stay the course despite the missed deadline. The Ethiopian expert also said he was confident that such a goal could still be reached shortly. Of course, we all wish that we had been able to reach a consensus on the agreement in time for this health assembly and cross the finish line, but I remain confident that you still will because where there is a will, there is a way. Tedros also pointed out that the WHO negotiators had undertaken an immense task technically, legally, and politically for which they had been operating on a very ambitious timeline. You have demonstrated a clear commitment to reaching an agreement, he added. Ghebreyesus also underlined the uphill task posed by a torrent of misinformation that was undermining your negotiations. After negotiators brief the Assembly bringing together dignitaries from all 194 WHO Member States on Tuesday about what has been achieved so far, the body is to decide which course of action to take in the following months, including a revision of the 1969 International Health Regulations (IHR) governing health emergencies in a legally binding manner. These proposals might have a better chance of being adopted this week, it was explained. The WHO is interested in avoiding an encore of how the Covid-19 crisis was handled in the early 2020s: It was all about “Me first,” Ghebreyesus said of how vaccines were purchased and distributed, which triggered the Pandemic Agreement initiative.",

        "content": "Prince William hosts garden party at Buckingham Palace Prince Philip, who was known for his frankness and quick wit, left his grandson, Prince William , in stitches after making a sweary remark during a photoshoot. Despite not being the head of the monarchy, Prince Philip wielded significant influence behind the scenes, and his passing in 2021 prompted an outpouring of heartfelt tributes from fellow royals. Prince Harry lauded his late grandfather's \"seriously sharp wit\" and his knack for \"holding the attention of any room due to his charm - and also because you never knew what he might say next.\" Prince William was all too familiar with his grandfather's propensity for off-the-cuff remarks, and was once spotted trying to suppress his laughter when Philip lost his cool. It happened in 2015, during the 75th anniversary celebration of the Battle of Britain - a pivotal event in World War II where the British Armed Forces defended Great Britain against German air attacks.

The photographer was taking his time getting everyone ready for the picture, which irked Prince Philip, who was 94 years old at the time. Philip, who served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, snapped - and used some pretty informal language to make his displeasure known. \"Just take the f*****g picture,\" Philip told the photographer, a moment that was caught on film by the Telegraph.

Philip's son Prince Edward - who now holds his late father's title of Duke of Edinburgh - also seemed to attempt to hold in his own giggles at Philip's impatience. Needless to say, the photographer quickly obeyed Philip's pretty brusque request, and once the picture was successfully captured, Philip was free to leave his posed seated position and got up immediately.

        "description": "The aircraft is the fifth to join the airline's fleet.",
        "content": "The gang is finally together! On Saturday, Azul Linhas Aéreas received its final Disney-liveried aircraft, an Airbus A320neo, with Goofy as the main character. In 2023, announced it would add a fifth Disney-themed aircraft to its fleet. At the time, it had already received four and had completed the “family,” or so we thought. Every one of the planes has been a new delivery from the Airbus facilities in Toulouse, France. Azul has nicknamed its Disney planes the “Magical Fleet,” playing on Disney’s marketing. Yesterday, the family was complete with the arrival of Goofy. The new aircraft is an Airbus A320neo. It began its journey from Europe on Friday and arrived on Saturday night at Aeroporto Internacional Belo Horizonte (commonly referred to as Confins because of its location near the city). There, the aircraft will go through its certification procedures to join the airline’s operations. According to Azul, the livery was designed by Walt Disney World Resort artists. The livery highlights Goofy’s special characteristics, like his iconic ears. After its assembly in Toulouse, the A320neo was painted at Airbus and delivered to the airline. “The aircraft in the ‘Most Magical Fleet In The World’ are very special to us at Azul because of the way they make customers happy and impact the customer experience. The happiness and sparkle in the eyes of adults and children when they discover they are flying on one of these planes is evident. Goofy is a classic, representing diversity and good humor, and we believe that the aircraft does just that.” Daniel Bicudo, Marketing and Business Director, Azul Linhas Aéreas In November 2021, Azul received its first Disney aircraft, ‘Mickey Mouse Nas Nuvens.’ Like Goofy, the Mickey plane is an Airbus A320neo. Registered as PR-YSH, the A320neo was the 50th of the type to join the airline’s fleet. Mickey was followed by ‘Minnie Mouse Nas Nuvens’ and ‘Pato Donald Nas Nuvens’, in February and June of 2022, respectively. The Minnie Mouse aircraft is the only one in the fleet on an A321neo, of which Azul has only six. When the Daisy aircraft joined the fleet, it was thought it would be the final one. Then, in February of 2023, the airline announced a pleasant surprise: there would be a fifth aircraft. There had been speculation for a long time that there would be a fifth plane and that it would be Goofy. And the rumors were true. Azul held a special event at its Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) hangar at Aeroporto Internacional de Viracopos, its main hub, to announce the fifth aircraft. All the characters from the first four planes made a special appearance, and two Brazilian singers gave a special performance of When You Wish Upon A Star. Azul’s CEO and Disney Destinations’ Senior Vice President were present to make the announcement.",

DAILY POST recalls that unidentified hoodlums, on Saturday, May 18, 2024, launched unprovoked attacks on Nigerian Army personnel at Banex Plaza, Wuse, Abuja, leading to the closure of the plaza. Major General Onyema Nwachukwu, Director, Army Public Relations, said in a statement that a meeting was convened in the Office of the National Security Adviser in the presence of the Principal General Staff Officer to the NSA, FCT Commissioner of Police, FCT Director of the Department of State Services, a representative of the Directorate of Abuja Environmental Protection Board, and the national chairman of the Mobile Phone Traders Association, where the leadership of Banex Plaza was instructed to lock up Shop C93 with immediate effect. According to the statement, the owners of the shop that orchestrated the mob attack on the soldiers are to be arrested and handed over to the Nigerian Police. The statement further added: “Market leaders are to remain vigilant and report any remaining perpetrators to the authorities. Furthermore, the two individuals already arrested have been handed over to the headquarters of the Nigerian Army Corps of Military Police for further action.” The Nigerian Army said it will also thoroughly investigate the circumstances surrounding the presence of its personnel at the plaza and the subsequent attack. “It must be reiterated that acts of violence against military personnel are not only condemnable but also pose a significant threat to national security and public order. We therefore urge members of the public to exercise caution and restraint when interacting with military personnel and other security operatives, especially when they are in uniform. There are established channels for reporting grievances or misconduct by personnel to the appropriate authorities,” the statement stressed.

According to the statement, the incident occurred at about 7am, on 27th May, 2024, morning while the contractor was stringing the cable on the last tower, which was supposed to enable the final jointing of the power cable in time for energizing of the line the same day. “TCN hereby states that tower number T290, one of the four new towers erected by TCN contractors along the Jos – Gombe 330kV transmission line collapsed during the cable stringing process. “The incident occurred at about 7am, this morning, 27th May, 2024, while the contractor was stringing the cable on the last tower, which was supposed to enable the final jointing of the power cable in time for energizing of the line today. “Despite of the security challenges in the area, TCN contractors and some of our engineering staff worked tirelessly to fast-track the project, doing all that was humanly possible to meet the time-line. Daily, the contractor, TCN engineers accompanied by security operatives consistently left the site by 10pm in the night and resumed work at 6am every day. “Constructing towers and stringing power cables at such heights is highly technical, although TCN contractors and staff have successfully completed similar projects in other parts of the country. The collapse of the fourth tower is a significant setback, given the extensive efforts to ensure that today’s power restoration timeline was met. “Our contractor is currently dismantling the collapsed tower members, to enable its reconstruction and final restringing of the cable. “It is unfortunate to note that while TCN is working on reconstructing and restringing the four vandalised towers, three (3) towers along the Biu – Danbua 132kV transmission line were also vandalized with 16 spans of conductors stolen. The towers, which have all collapsed include towers T1690, T1691 and T1692. TCN has mobilized a contractor to commence their reconstruction. This discovery was made by TCN patrol team, last Friday. “Additionally, this morning, the TCN lines patrol team discovered that tower T540 along the Makurdi – Jos 330kV double circuit transmission line has been vandalised. Sections of the tower have been removed, although the tower remains standing. TCN has contracted emergency repairs, to prevent its collapse. “We reiterate our commitment to restoring normal bulk power supply through the distribution companies serving the North East and other areas affected by vandalism. There is however an urgent need for everyone to join hand with TCN in protecting our collective assets by being vigilant and reporting any suspected acts of tower and line vandalism promptly” the statement reads in parts.",

        "content": "HALIFAX, Nova Scotia, May 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Java Blend employees have won their union. After a settlement was reached yesterday, ballots cast a year ago in a vote to unionize were finally counted this morning – and 91% of workers voted to join SEIU Local 2. “We are very proud – this wasn’t easy,” said Andy Mawko, one of the worker leaders. “We stood up for ourselves and fought for what was right. When we fight, we win!” “We are excited to start negotiations in good faith as soon as possible,” said Em Kristensen, another one of the terminated leaders. “We are looking forward to winning a collective agreement that addresses concerns like job security, health and safety protections and setting the foundation for a long-term relationship between the Java Blend and our Union.” This is a big win for the workers at Java Blend. “We have an important message to the beautiful community that supported us,” said Cailen Pygott. “Together, we can achieve incredible things! From regular customers to prominent leaders, artists like El Jones, and from businesses that believe in doing the right thing: Thank you. Halifax is a Union town — and we encourage all non-union service workers to unite and organize.” There is an agreement to start good faith bargaining soon and to reach the best possible collective agreement over the next four weeks. The agreement includes a provision to start recalling terminated employees; their dismissal was the subject of an Unfair Labour Practice complaint filed by SEIU, which has now been withdrawn. The Union won a bargaining unit that includes the Java Blend cafes on North St and Sackville in Halifax, the production and roastery warehouse on Borden Ave. in Dartmouth, as well as the Cortado Tasting Room in Bedford. If a deal is not ratified in the agreed timeframe, the parties have agreed to conciliation. The Union has called off the boycott of Java Blend and all it’s products.

        "description": "Police said they closed the elevated wooden walkway just after midnight after receiving an \"irrepressible number\" of complaints about an \"extremely large number of young adults & juveniles\" flooding the shore town.",
        "content": "The New Jersey shore town Wildwood closed its popular boardwalk for a few hours early Sunday morning after hordes of “unruly, undisciplined” teens descended on the walkway, local officials said. Police shut down the boardwalk to the public just past midnight after receiving an “irrepressible number” of complaints about an “extremely large number of young adults & juveniles” visiting the boardwalk for Memorial Day Weekend, according to a statement from authorities. City officials did not cite a specific incident that led them to shut down the boardwalk, but claimed that cops were addressing “civil unrest.” Conditions “began to deteriorate despite the presence and efforts of local police officers and multiple mutual aid law enforcement agencies,” the statement adds. Wildwood Mayor Ernie Troiano, Jr. said that the city had declared a “state of emergency” – which allows it to send an abnormally large police presence to the area – and blamed the situation on “unruly” teens. “Wildwood will not tolerate unruly, undisciplined, unparented children nor will we stand by while the laws of the state tie the hands of the police,” Troiano, Jr said in a news release. “We wholeheartedly support the City of Wildwood Police Department in protecting this community from these nuisance crowds on our boardwalk and in the city,” the mayor added. Local cops were so busy responding to the “unrest” on the boardwalk that “we were unable to respond to certain calls for service within the city for a period of time,” Wildwood city officials said in the statement. Police re-opened the boardwalk at around 5:30 a.m., removing police tape that had been set up at the walkway’s entrances, according to a report from NBC10 Philadelphia. A rainstorm that erupted overnight also helped disperse whatever crowds remained, video from the scene shows. Local authorities said they would be giving “no further statements or interviews” explaining why they declared the state of emergency “in honor of the solemness” of the Memorial Day holiday. The boardwalk shutdown comes a day after a 15-year-old boy was stabbed on the boardwalk in nearby Ocean City Saturday night, spending panicked crowds of beachgoers fleeing the area.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — UCLA Chancellor Gene Block found himself in the nation’s culture wars hot seat this past week, interrogated by members of Congress about his handling of complaints of campus antisemitism, amid student protests over the Israel-Hamas war. For Republican Congress members, the hearing organized by the GOP-led House Committee on Education and the Workforce was a chance to present the University of California, Los Angeles as exhibit A in how not to deal with protests. Almost as soon as activists set up a Palestinian solidarity encampment April 25 in the heart of campus, Jewish students and faculty complained that demonstrators established checkpoints restricting access to many students, at times singling out students they identified as Zionists. After pro-Israeli counterprotesters attacked the encampment on April 30, it was dismantled May 2, with law enforcement arresting more than 200 people. “Over the course of years, decades even, universities gradually nurtured a campus culture of radicalism, in which antisemitism grew and became tolerated by administrators,” Virginia Foxx, the commitee chair, said in her opening remarks. The Republican from North Carolina assailed Block for allowing UCLA’s protests to spiral out of control. “For days, you stood by as Jews were assaulted and illegal checkpoints blocked access to campus in broad daylight,” Foxx said. “Your actions were too little, too late.” In his opening testimony, Block conceded that UCLA made errors in judgment. The encampment, he said, “disrupted normal access to some classes” and “impeded our educational mission.” “With the benefit of hindsight,” he said, “we should have been prepared to immediately remove the encampment if and when the safety of our community was put at risk.” Block did not specify what UCLA should have done to prevent discrimination or violence as protests ramped up. And he did not explain why the university did not take action as students reported discrimination from protesters and outside agitators gathered on campus. Striking a mild, noncombative approach throughout, Block did not say what campus discipline had been — or would be — meted out to students who violated UCLA rules. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., criticized UCLA leaders for standing by for hours as a “mob of agitators” gathered near the encampment. Block said he rejected the premise of the question. Block said the Los Angeles Police Department was working to identify the attackers. Rep. Kevin Kiley, a California Republican, asked Block whether physically obstructing students from entering campus based on their race, ethnicity or religion is an expellable offense. ‘There is a disciplinary process,” Block said. “It could be.” Kiley played a viral video showing UCLA protesters blocking a student, Eli Tsives, from passing a checkpoint. “Were those students who formed blockade?” Kiley said. “Were they disciplined?” Block said he didn’t know, repeating that he sent out a memo April 30 instructing the campus community that blocking students’ passage was intolerable. Block, who is Jewish and has family members who died in the Holocaust, said UCLA has a problem with antisemitism. “I am fully aware that many of our Jewish students have had to confront rhetoric and images on campus that any reasonable person would find repugnant,” Block said in his opening statement. “Trust me, I understand their pain.” Asked by Rep. Kathy Manning, a Democrat from North Carolina, about emails dating to 2014 that show alumni had alerted the chancellor of growing antisemitism, Block said the university had tried to respond with training. About 90 percent of students, he said, had taken an online training course that includes discussion of antisemitism. Manning asked whether students and staff need additional training. “I think we need to do more,” Block said.",

        "content": "A woman will stand trial Aug. 19 for allegedly possessing almost 2 pounds of cocaine in her residence. Charnelle N. Mond, 27, listed with an alternate residence in , appeared Friday in and entered a not-guilty plea for a charge of unlawful possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, a Class X felony. Mond was charged April 25 after drug agents raided a Peru dwelling and seized about 900 grams of purported cocaine, according to prosecutors. Elevated drug felonies are weight-dependent, meaning Mond could face 12 to 50 years in prison if convicted and if lab testing confirms the volume reached 900 grams. Mond, who was granted the services of a public defender, will next appear Aug. 9 for a motions hearing. She had been granted pretrial release. Mond was charged after the Tri-County Drug Enforcement Narcotics Team and Peru police officers executed a search warrant of Mond’s residence and found ammunition and guns (including a stolen shotgun, police said) “littered throughout” the residence, prosecutors had said. Although Mond had a firearm owner’s identification card, a second individual is charged with unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon in addition to the drug charge. Robert L. Wright Jr., 38, was denied pretrial release in part because authorities allege that the convicted felon was within “arm’s reach” of a firearm during the drug raid, the judge had said. Wright is in custody and thus is subject to a speedier trial demand. He will next appear July 11 for a motions hearing and again July 18 for a final pretrial conference.",

        "content": "Locals in a Devon town centre have 'protested' against a controversial works scheme by removing cones from parking spaces. The contentious plan to revamp Queen Street in Newton Abbot is set to start tomorrow (May 28) but yellow cones were placed in parking bays along the street earlier today. One resident reportedly took it upon themselves to pick up the cones and stack them up on the pavement to make way for vehicles to park. One witness who took pictures of the stacked up cones told DevonLive: \"Cone rebellion going on in Newton Abbot due to the extremely controversial closing of Queen Street to traffic. It's in part an organised protest.\" According to the Devon County Council website, the works on Queen Street are due to start on Tuesday. It will affect the section of Queen Street between Courtenay Street and The Avenue, and a number of the surrounding junctions and side roads.

The council said its goal is to finish all the improvements by the end of November 2024, in time for the busy Christmas shopping season. The scheme includes a range of improvements such as widening footways, enhancing pedestrian crossings, reducing speed limits, upgrading the bus stop, and introducing more greenery and public seating. Throughout the duration of the work, parking for blue badge holders will continue to be available in both Queen Street and nearby Victoria Place. Businesses will operate as usual and once the work commences, information boards and drop-in sessions will keep traders, shoppers, and residents updated on the plans, their progress, and any potential impact on shoppers or road users. However, the scheme will see the majority of on-street parking in Queen Street removed. Access to the section of Queen Street beyond the junction with Albany Street will be restricted to buses, pedestrians, cycles and loading. Devon County Council said during the construction phases, the current level of parking availability will be maintained as far as possible however during each phase, some parking bays might be occupied for construction and safety reasons. ⚠️ Want the latest Devon breaking news and top stories first?

ALSO READ: Maritime security: House Committee seeks alternate funding for Deep Blue project Speaking at the stakeholders public hearing of the new bill on Monday before the House Committee on Shipping Services and Committee on ports and harbor in Abuja, the Executive Secretary of NSC, Barrister Puis Akutah said the proposed new regulatory framework will encourage more private sector participation in the sector. The ES explained that the bill seeks to enhance efficiency, promote ease of doing business, and create cost-effectiveness in the shipping sector while promoting seamless cargo movement within and outside African continent. “If passed into law, the bill will promote competition, ensure consumer protection, and elevate service quality standards. It mandates all stakeholders to adhere to regulations, preventing monopolistic practices, excessive pricing, and arbitrary behaviors. Regulators will be empowered to enforce rules impartially and provide necessary administrative and political support.” Akutah further stated that to maintain a level playing field and uphold fair trade practices without adding undue financial burdens, the bill proposes retaining the 1% fair standardisation fee as a funding source. He said the proposed bill, if enacted, promises to revolutionise the industry, creating a conducive environment for business growth, investment, and job creation while safeguarding consumer interests and promoting fair competition. The NSC boss notes that the legislative move aims to transform Nigeria’s shipping and ports sector into a dynamic force for economic growth, revenue generation, and employment sustainability. In his address, the Speaker of the House of Representative, Tajudeen Abbas reaffirmed that the bill will empower shippers council with the needed authority to oversee and manage the economic activities within Nigerian’s maritime sector. Represented by Sani Suli, the Speaker stated that the new legislative work seek to streamline procedures and eliminate any constraints that were present in the 2004 Ac. He explained that the reenactment of the new bill will not only ensure an economic regulatory framework for NSC for effective regulation of commercial activities in the shipping port sector, but the bill will also create friendly environment for private sector participation for the growth of the industry. “The bill lays out financial provisions, define guidelines for the allocation, management and auditing of funds, which is crucial for maintaining financial integrity and providing the council with the necessary resources to perform its duties,” he noted.",

        "content": "The internet never sleeps, giving us a never-ending news cycle. While we ought to keep you posted with all the latest happenings in the tech world, a few gems slip through the cracks. Fear not, because we’ve got you covered. Welcome to our first edition of “News You Probably Missed and Shouldn’t Have!”—the weekly roundup of stories that deserve the spotlight. So, buckle up, because while these headlines may not have made the front page, they’re definitely worthy of a glance, or maybe two—and a chuckle. Prepare to be entertained by the tech news that somehow evaded your social media feeds (we know social media is your ultimate news destination). Let’s get started! Samsung & ARM start laying the foundation for 6G Smartphone giant Samsung and processor IP maker ARM are gearing up for the next big thing in mobile data: 6G. Yes, while most of us are still trying to find a decent 5G signal or even 4G in some places, these tech titans are already plotting the future. The two firms have started laying the foundation for the next generation of wireless communication technology. Current estimates are that it will take another five or six years for 6G to be available commercially. Tell you what, there might be a pattern here—4G debuted in 2009 and 5G in 2019. Is anyone betting on a 6G launch in 2029? We aren’t. But people say AI will revolutionize the tech landscape in the years to come. Who knows the so-called faster internet will come to us faster. For now, let’s hope 6G doesn’t stand for “6th Generation of Disappointment”! Samsung appoints a new head of its semiconductor division Samsung has appointed Young Hyun Jun as the new head of its Device Solutions Division which incorporates its semiconductor business. With a career spanning over two decades across various roles within the company’s semiconductor unit, the 64-year-old Young is stepping into a key position responsible for advancing the Korean firm’s chip technology. Given the sub-par performance of its Exynos chips in the past, let’s hope he brings a secret sauce to finally spice things up. TSMC would kill itself rather than live under Chinese control TSMC, the world’s largest semiconductor foundry, has contingency plans against a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan that could hand over its controls to Beijing. While the US is already scared about the implications of such an event and rightly so, the Taiwanese company itself doesn’t want to live under Chinese control. It has worked with its Dutch chip machine supplier ASML on a tech that would remotely disable the chip machines and render them useless in the event of an invasion. Imagine the chaos: Chinese invaders storming in only to find TSMC’s factory turned into a high-tech ghost town. It would be no less than a scene from a sci-fi movie where the robots revolt. But in this case, the machines pull the plug on themselves rather than attacking the attackers. TSMC’s influence in the tech industry is an example of why regulators want to break big internet companies like Google. When things go bad, it could send the world into disarray. Installing PWAs and Android apps made easy on Chrome OS Google has introduced an “Add to Chromebook” badge and “ChromeOS app URL” to make it easier for Chrome OS users to install Android apps and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). The badge takes users to the Play Store listing of an Android app. In the case of PWAs, those can be installed from anywhere . You no longer have to be inside a PWA in a browser tab to get an install button. Thanks, Google! You finally figured out that users were fumbling around, asking, “PWA (Please, Where’s the App)?” Humane is looking for humans to buy it out After a delay, Humane finally started selling its much-hyped Ai Pin last month. It was supposed to be a revolutionary AI companion to assist you with various tasks, potentially replacing your smartphone in some. However, the voice-controlled wearable device with a built-in digital assistant had poor word of mouth and never took off. Barely a month after Humane started selling its first and only product, it is now seeking buyers for itself . The AI startup hasn’t officially announced that it is looking for humans willing to buy it. However, people familiar with the matter say Humane will gleefully hand over its reigns to a new owner for anything between $750 million and $1 billion. If this sale goes through within the next few months, it might set a new record for a startup’s first product launch to a potential buyout. The AI landscape isn’t all sunshine and roses, it seems. TikTok to lay off over 1,000 employees Ahead of a potential reduction in its user base (a US ban would cut affect over 170 million users), TikTok is shrinking its workforce. The ByteDance-owned company is planning a major layoff affecting over 1,000 employees . The job cut will hit various internal teams and departments—probably not the legal department (it needs a lot of legal experts to work in tandem if it were to live on in the US beyond January 2025). So, while TikTok dances its way through the courts, some of its employees may be soon left doing the cha-cha slide out the door. Windows PowerToys unleashes advanced AI copy-paste PowerToys for Windows 11 has just added a new AI tool: Advanced Paste. It lets you convert your clipboard content on the fly, speeding up your workflow. You can copy code in one language and paste it in another. You can also run other types of conversions before pasting, including summarizing text, translating it to a different language, and rephrasing it to change its tone. Gone are the days of accidentally pasting cat memes into serious work documents—what you paste is always on point. But hey, this tool is super useful, so you have to pay us. Not us, but those who brought it to you. Available with PowerToys version 0.81 , you can enable Advanced Paste using the key combination “Windows Key + Shift + V”. But to use it to its full potential, you need to link your OpenAI account and buy OpenAI API credits. Nah, a paid ChatGPT account doesn’t give you API credits. YouTube is testing a redesigned layout, again YouTube regularly tests UI redesigns and tweaks to give users a pixel-perfect viewing experience that’s smoother than a cat’s nap. It keeps what works and discards what doesn’t. The company appears to be preparing another redesign. On the desktop version, it is moving the video title, description, comments, and other buttons to the right side. The video appears on the left , with recommendations showing up with bigger thumbnails directly under it. This redesign has been in the works for a while now but hasn’t shown up for many. We certainly don’t want it in its current state—those big thumbnails under the video are massive distractions. How come YouTube UI designers do not see that? Or they just turned a blind eye to it? Come on Google, you are better than this (or at least the world thinks you are). Xiaomi to make its own smartphone chipsets Xiaomi seems to be fed up with the lack of choices when it comes to smartphone processors. It is making its own. Codenamed “Ring,” the chipset is currently in development with the high-end segment in mind. The chip may still be far away but the Chinese firm appears determined to make a groundbreaking entry in a few years and shake the flagship SoC market currently captured by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon and MediaTek’s Dimensity chips. Samsung also makes Exynos-branded flagships SoCs, but those have always been sub-par. Wouldn’t it be amazing if Xiaomi came along and made a better chip than Samsung right away? Adaptive Audio for Google Meet Google Meet is stepping up its audio game with the introduction of Adaptive Audio . It is a game-changing feature that ensures your virtual meetings sound as clear as a bell. The new feature can detect the presence of multiple laptops in the room (and multiple people shouting at their bosses at once—just kidding, you shouldn’t shout at anyone, unless your boss is a clod) and synchronize the microphones and speakers to eliminate echoes and audio feedback. This allows you and your colleagues to participate in meetings from anywhere. Bluesky adds DMs, finally BlueSky, Twitter’s decentralized dream, is finally adding DMs . You can now send messages to your friends and families via the app. If they are on it, of course (don’t be surprised if some of them point upwards when you ask them what Bluesky is). DMs work on the app and website but only support text conversations in one-to-one chats. No group chats and media support, oh, really? The company says these features, along with end-to-end encryption, are planned for later. Snapseed gets a rare update Snapseed, the Google-owned photo editing software tool for mobile devices, recently picked up a minor update. This is the first update for the app in nearly eight months . It brings version 2.22 with no user-facing changes or functional improvements. Considering how rare updates for Snapseed are (feature updates are even rarer), Google seems to be losing interest in it. The company acquired the tool in 2012 and appears to have little incentive to support it further. We wouldn’t be surprised if the app ends up in the Google Graveyard in a few years. Help yourself to disabling Chrome’s “Help me write” AI tool Are you fed up with AI tools interrupting you unnecessarily? Some Chrome users may have been. Google recently started actively pushing a “Help me write: Powered by Google” bubble in Chrome to promote its experimental writing assistant. Thankfully, if you are annoyed by this bubble, you can disable it . To do that, go to Settings > Privacy and security > Site settings > Content > Additional content settings > Offer writing help (at the bottom). Google couldn’t have made it more difficult to disable this tool. WhatsApp is working on AI-generated profile photos AI is coming everywhere and you can’t do anything about it. You may be able to disable some AI tools (like Google’s “Help me write” for Chrome), but you will encounter more of them in other places. WhatsApp may soon introduce one. The Meta-owned messaging app is working on AI-generated profile photos (but why?). Because who needs a regular selfie when you can have an AI-generated masterpiece, right? No, we don’t need a virtual Picasso painting our profile pictures. But then again, all tech firms have to show that their products boast the latest AI tools. While AI is undeniably powerful, it feels like tech companies sometimes rely too heavily on it as a buzzword rather than focusing on meaningful advancements. It’s like promising a gourmet meal and delivering a reheated TV dinner—underwhelming and lacking that wow factor. Someone at X doesn’t like to show “likes” publicly X, the social media platform we knew as Twitter before the Elon Musk era, will soon stop showing the posts you have liked to other users. The company is making likes private because “public likes are incentivizing the wrong behavior.” People avoid liking some posts fearing retaliation from trolls. While liking posts on X may not be as nerve-racking as navigating a minefield, this move from X will certainly help people maintain a pristine online image while still enjoying the content they love. It’s like a digital self-care package. AI is coming to Amazon Alexa too, but at a price Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant is getting an AI makeover. The company is working on new generative AI capabilities for the decade-old assistant. However, unlike most other companies, it won’t make the AI features free. The e-commerce giant would charge a monthly subscription for it . Worse yet, it won’t be included in an Amazon Prime subscription. The question is, how many people would be willing to pay Amazon for AI features available free elsewhere? It’s like inviting a brainy friend to the party but having to pay a cover charge for their wit and wisdom. But hey, maybe Amazon will pave the way for an AI subscription model in the virtual assistant realm, and everyone will follow, leaving users with no other choice. Only time will tell. TikTok disrupted over a dozen covert influence campaigns this year TikTok has disrupted more than a dozen covert influence campaigns since January this year. The company has placed measures to detect such campaigns where several accounts coordinate to sway political discourse. It removes accounts engaging in these kinds of practices. It has already detected 15 influence campaigns this year, including one originating from China. These campaigns spanned 3,000 accounts that had millions of followers combined. Great job, TikTok. We don’t get many chances to say that, do we? HMD Aura is an incredibly affordable Android smartphone HMD has launched Aura, an incredibly affordable Android smartphone. Priced at AUD 180 (approx. USD 120), it offers a decent set of specs for its price. It appears to be currently limited to Australia, where potential buyers can find it on local retailer JB Hi-Fi . There is no word on its availability elsewhere. It is unclear if HMD will showcase Aura’s aura in other parts of the world. As for its specs, the phone has a 6.56-inch HD+ display, a 13MP main camera, a 5MP selfie camera, a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, a Unisoc SC9863A1 processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB internal storage (supports microSD cards up to 256GB), dual SIM support, a USB Type-C port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It packs a 5,000 mAh battery and supports 10W wired charging. YouTube Music lets you hum to find songs YouTube Music is bringing a musical genie to your phone. Even if you have forgotten a song’s lyrics, title, artists, and all, you can still magically find the song that’s playing in your mind. Just hum its tune, and presto—your phone magically finds the song for you . With “Hum to search,” you don’t have to make multiple Google searches with vague descriptions to find that one song. The new feature is available with version 7.02 of YouTube Music for Android, though it may take a while before this ability reaches everyone.",

In the video, which was released this weekend, the lion is seen lurking in the shadows of a well-lit street on the outskirts of Nairobi.

        "description": "Stormy Daniels reveals death threats she has received since Donald Trump's hush money trial.",
        "content": "President Donald Trump’s hush money trial is nearing its end, with closing arguments expected shortly. But for Stormy Daniels, the aptly named woman caught in the whirlwind, there’s no end to her ordeal , the Daily Mirror has revealed. Indeed, Trump may be the one on trial, but it’s Stormy who’s been judged every day for the past five years. Trump blasted for 'disrespectful' saluting blunder - sparking huge rules debate Donald Trump named fattest US president in history due to McDonald's addiction And unlike Trump’s New York jury of his peers, Stormy’s being judged by those with little mercy, little care for evidence, and scant regard for Justice. And with Trump making another run for The White House, she knows the haters and the abuse are only likely to get worse. Speaking from her home in Texas, Stormy says: “Back in 2018, there was stuff like ‘liar’, ‘slut’, ‘gold digger’. This time around, it’s different. “It is direct threats. It is ‘I’m going to come to your house to slit your throat’.” The intensified abuse and violent threats got worse after the decision to charge Trump over alleged hush money payments made to her. People have become so angry at her role in Trump’s potential downfall, that they have convinced themselves their beliefs and actions are valid. So much so, most are not even hiding their identities. “They’re not even using bot accounts, they’re using their real accounts,” she says. “I compare them to suicide bombers. They legitimately think that what they’re doing is right. Those people who see me as a villain. “It just makes me scratch my head and really question how they would want their daughters treated, or their sisters, or their mother.” Her comments are featured in a new TV documentary, Stormy, to be shown for the first time in the UK tonight [TUES] on Channel 5. It’s timed as the trial reaches its final stages. During a car ride, Stormy reads out some of the vile messages she has received including: “Even if you’d have been raped, you should have kept your mouth quiet for the greater good” and “You’re nothing but a fat hillbilly, Trump would never touch you, stop lying, before I’m forced to shut you up myself” She adds that that is a ‘direct threat’. Earlier this month, Stormy, 45, testified in the criminal fraud trial of former President Trump, where she made a number of bombshell claims about her alleged affair with him. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has accused Trump of falsifying business records to disguise an alleged $130,000 (£104,000) hush-money payment made to Daniels in a bid to hide damaging information just before the US election in 2016. Stormy, who married her fourth husband, Barret Blade, in December 2022, claimed that Trump would call her at least once a week during their affair and beg her to see him. She said he would “profess his love and beg to see me again”. Stormy - whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford - is then seen sitting at her kitchen table surrounded by piles of legal documents and praises her attorney, Clark Brewster. “There is a never ending avalanche of court documents, lawsuits and court transcripts”, she says. “I wanted to die. If I had all of these legal bills piled up. I would never have been able to pay them. And Clark is the only one who never charged me and kept fighting for me. I can’t even imagine where I would be.” She talks philosophically about what she has learnt since the story first broke. “The way this is different from 2018 is that I have more knowledge, “ she says. “The shock of it’s not the same. I’m desensitised to some of it. But they’ve also become more violent with me. “I’m more prepared with my legal knowledge but I’m also tired. Like my soul is so tired.” She also described why she signed the NDA, claiming she was afraid for her family if she didn’t. For Stormy, she will just be pleased when this is finally over. Her life has been transformed but she’s determined not to give up. She says: “I won’t give up as I’m telling the truth. “And I kind of don’t know if that matters anymore.” If you or someone you know needs support now, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org",

They said heavy vehicles would be managed in a regulated after assessing the road condition on Tuesday. Traffic officials monitoring the regulation of traffic in Ramban said that the National Highway remained open but the traffic movement remained slow due to on foot movement of nomads and their livestock, slippery road conditions and single lane carriageway at Dalwass, Mehad –Cafeteria, Panthyal Nachlana, Gangroo, Shalgari, Kishtwari Pathar and poor road surface conditions at many places between Nashri-Banihal sectors. They said despite slow traffic movement hundreds of light medium and heavy vehicles had crossed the Nashri-Banihal sector for their respective destinations without any interruption till late this evening. They said heavy load carriers are heading towards Jammu in a regulated manner. Earlier, during the day traffic congestion was observed at many places between Ramban and Banihal due to on foot movement of nomads with their livestock and due to single-lane and poor road surface conditions at many places between Ramban and Banihal.",

        "content": "To say that the Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback room looks a lot different this year would be an understatement. And so does the Steelers offense. With the additions of Russell Wilson and Justin Fields, the franchise hopes that one of these players will provide stability and be the answer to the post-Ben Roethlisberger era. Arthur Smith is the offensive coordinator tasked with arguably the most important job of all this season: building an offense around Russell Wilson or Justin Fields’ strengths while minimizing their weaknesses in hopes of contending for an AFC North crown. Things didn’t work out for any of the three parties in their previous stops, and pulling back the layers on why that was is critical to this equation. SN analyst Derrick Bell is joined by SB Nation contributor and creator of the Tape Don’t Lie YouTube channel Marcus Johnson to discuss the Steelers quarterback room. What does Wilson have left in the tank and how can Pittsburgh get the most of out of him? What type of offense is Fields best suited for, and how can he balance his development as a passer while capitalizing on his athletic gifts along the way? Consider this a deep dive on how the Steelers should construct their offense around their new quarterbacks and the reasonable expectations from this experiment.

        "content": "The Los Angeles Clippers are heading to the offseason with questions surrounding the team; the biggest one being Paul George’s contract. Since the Clippers made the Western Conference Finals in 2021, they missed the playoffs in 2022, and had back to back first round playoff exits. When the Clippers made the trade for Paul George and signed Kawhi Leonard back in 2019, they had Championship aspirations. It has been five years for the George-Leonard era and they have only made it to the conference finals once. Now as we enter the 2024 offseason with disappointment after disappointment, this era for the Clippers could be coming to an end. The Clippers already gave Kawhi Leonard a three year deal for $152.4 million . However, that is not the case for George as he has a player option for the 2024-2025 NBA season in which he plans to decline. If he declines it, he will become an unrestricted free agent. The Clippers have the ability to offer him a four-year, $221 million deal. However, they refuse to pay George that money and are unwilling to top what they gave Leonard in any contract talks for Paul George according to Kevin O’Conner of the ringer. Evaluating the Paul George Contract Situation with the LA Clippers If the Clippers refuse to increase their offer, that will create an opportunity for other teams to land George in free agency like the Philadelphia 76ers . Imagine PG in Philly How far would this team go? (via @KevinOConnorNBA ) pic.twitter.com/3Bf84rbpx5 — Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) May 22, 2024 According to Kevin O’Connor the Philadelphia 76ers plan is to pursue Paul George if he enters free agency . The 76ers can offer him a four year, $212 million deal, which would make it more than what the Clippers have been offering him. Keith Pompey of the Philadelphia Inquirer noted the 76ers’ “desire to sign Paul George is well known.” Paul George who is 34 years old and with Kawhi Leonard being 33 years old, with both players having a history of injury concerns . As this was the first year since 2018 were George has played more than 60 games, and it was the first year for Leonard since 2017 of playing 70 games in a year. There is definitely a reason why the clippers are hesitant to re-sign Paul George in a contract extension, to keep committing to this duo for multiple years into the future. Especially with the Western Conference being as loaded as it is with a bunch of young rising stars. George is still playing at a high level still when healthy averaging 22.6 points, 5.2 rebounds, 3.5 assists, and 1.5 steals per game while shooting 47.1 percent from the field and 41.3 percent from deep. The production is still their for George and it would make sense for the Clippers to want him back. However, is giving a contract extension to Paul George their best path forward to still compete in the West and because of that they may not be willing to offer him more than a team like the 76ers would.

        "content": "U.Today - A substantial withdrawal of 1,195 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $81.95 million, has been made from Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. This transfer to an unknown address has caught the attention of the crypto community as, typically, massive withdrawals from exchanges are perceived as bullish signals for the price. The logic is simple: large investors buy digital assets on liquid platforms like Binance and then move them to private wallets for storage, indicating long-term holding strategies. Diving deeper into the data we can learn that the address \"bc1qm34\" hosted by the exchange transferred millions of tokens to \"1126a\" in one tranche. This address is relatively fresh and was activated a month ago by a transfer from the same Binance - for 89,668 BTC, equivalent to $5.62 million. In general, all interactions of this address are related to Binance, as well as the address \"bc1q7.\" That is, funds move only between these three addresses. A deeper dive through Arkham Intelligence data, however, reveals that the address in question may belong to Ceffu - an institutional digital asset platform offering custody and liquidity solutions. The second address, however, also belongs to the platform and is its custodial address. It now holds 250.219 BTC worth $17.45 million. Thus, it can be stated that there is no special mystery and mysticism in this transfer - just one platform withdraws Bitcoin from the largest, and in fact, liquid, platform for its own needs. Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues to trade around $70,000 per coin. Toward the end of the day today, the price of the main cryptocurrency is adding more than 2%. To reach the absolute maximum price of Bitcoin, at $74,000, less than 5.5% remains. This content was originally published on U.Today",

        "content": "An 18-year-old pupil was detained in western France on Monday after stabbing his English teacher in the face and fleeing, authorities said. The teacher from the town of Chemille-en-Anjou in western France \"suffered a facial injury that is not life-threatening\", said a joint statement from the authorities including the prefect and public prosecutor. Law enforcement officers could be seen in front of the Lycee de l'Hyrome where the attack took place on Monday morning, according to an AFP photographer at the scene. Speaking to reporters, public prosecutor Eric Bouillard ruled out \"any religious or radical motive\", adding that the suspect expressed feelings of \"unhappiness.\" According to the prosecutor's account, the pupil attacked the teacher during class after a break. He \"grabbed the teacher from behind and stabbed her in the face, causing panic in the classroom,\" he said. After the attack the suspect quickly left through the window, abandoning his knife, according to the authorities. He was detained by gendarmes and municipal police. Bouillard said the pupil did not seem to have any grievances against the teacher, he added. Bouillard said that while the teacher was hit in the cheek and her injury was minor \"the psychological impact\" will be \"much greater\", Bouillard said. The young man had been a pupil at the school for three years and returned there Monday after an absence due to illness. Fellow pupils said he appeared in a good mood on Monday morning. 'Deeply shocked' The suspect bought the knife last week, the prosecutor said. \"He saw this knife and bought it, knowing that he was going to do something with it,\" he said, adding that the pupil complained of \"too much pressure.\" Officials said the young man was not previously known to the police, adding that counselling was provided to pupils and teachers after the attack. An investigation into \"attempted murder\" has been launched. Education Minister Nicole Belloubet said she was \"deeply shocked and outraged\". \"My thoughts are with the victim and the entire educational community\", she added on X. France has in recent years been shaken by a series of school incidents involving attacks on teachers as well as schoolchildren by their peers. In April, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal announced measures to crack down on teenage violence in and around schools, as the government seeks to reclaim ground on security from the far-right ahead of upcoming European elections.",

        "content": "U.Today - A substantial withdrawal of 1,195 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $81.95 million, has been made from Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. This transfer to an unknown address has caught the attention of the crypto community as, typically, massive withdrawals from exchanges are perceived as bullish signals for the price. The logic is simple: large investors buy digital assets on liquid platforms like Binance and then move them to private wallets for storage, indicating long-term holding strategies. Diving deeper into the data we can learn that the address \"bc1qm34\" hosted by the exchange transferred millions of tokens to \"1126a\" in one tranche. This address is relatively fresh and was activated a month ago by a transfer from the same Binance - for 89,668 BTC, equivalent to $5.62 million. In general, all interactions of this address are related to Binance, as well as the address \"bc1q7.\" That is, funds move only between these three addresses. A deeper dive through Arkham Intelligence data, however, reveals that the address in question may belong to Ceffu - an institutional digital asset platform offering custody and liquidity solutions. The second address, however, also belongs to the platform and is its custodial address. It now holds 250.219 BTC worth $17.45 million. Thus, it can be stated that there is no special mystery and mysticism in this transfer - just one platform withdraws Bitcoin from the largest, and in fact, liquid, platform for its own needs. Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues to trade around $70,000 per coin. Toward the end of the day today, the price of the main cryptocurrency is adding more than 2%. To reach the absolute maximum price of Bitcoin, at $74,000, less than 5.5% remains. This content was originally published on U.Today",

        "content": "Coin Edition - Justin Sun urges crypto community to back a pro-crypto U.S. president. If re-elected, Trump will promote Bitcoin, self-custody, and oppose CBDC. Long-term crypto success requires ethical leadership like Jack Ma and CZ. The cryptocurrency community is being urged to support a U.S. presidential candidate who champions their interests. TRON founder Justin Sun stated, “We need to demonstrate to the candidate that the cryptocurrency communities, companies, and protocols are vital stakeholders whose voices must be heard and whose interests must be protected.” Former President Donald Trump is one American presidential contender who has expressed support for cryptocurrency, according to Coin Edition. Should he be re-elected, Trump has promised to champion Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In addition to supporting self-custody rights, he plans to keep well-known anti-crypto senator Elizabeth Warren away from the sector and to fight the introduction of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in the United States. In response to Sun’s appeal, a user commented that politicians were only interested in themselves. However, he acknowledged that Trump has pledged to shield Bitcoin from governmental actions, potentially making this the first election that is truly favorable to cryptocurrency. Whether he will honor his word remains to be seen. On the other hand, citing Binance’s Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and Jack Ma, Sun underlined the need for ethical leadership in the cryptocurrency industry. He noted that these leaders never choose the easy option. “It is not always easy and may not pay off right away to do the right thing. But never forget, ‘Do what is right, because it is right.'” Sun observed a similar pattern in CZ’s entrepreneurial journey: profitable businesses are those that consistently outperform in user value. The appeal to back pro-crypto presidential candidates is part of a larger effort by the cryptocurrency community to ensure their concerns are adequately represented in the highest levels of government.

        "content": "Coin Edition - Balaji argues the Fed’s monetary policy is unpredictable compared to Bitcoin’s consistent issuance, which he considers crucial alongside its scarcity. The Fed made three rate cuts by March 2024 but is ready to raise rates if needed. The Fed plans to maintain restrictive policies if inflation remains high. Balaji Srinivasan, the former chief technology officer of Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN ), has criticized the Federal Reserve, arguing that the Fed’s funds are “poor predictors of monetary policy paths.” The tech mogul asserted that the Fed’s policy is unpredictable, contrasting it with Bitcoin’s consistent monetary policy. “if you made the graph of Bitcoin’s predicted issuance versus its actual issuance over the last 15 years, they would be exactly superimposed,” Balaji stated. This predictability, he contends, is as crucial as Bitcoin’s scarcity. Balaji previously likened the Fed’s approach to controlling a complex system through votes. “Imagine trying to control a highly multivariate system by adjusting a single parameter with a committee vote, with a feedback delay measured in months while the characteristic time of the system is in seconds. That’s the Fed.” He argued that this approach is unsustainable, asserting that the Fed cannot effectively control the system. The Fed implemented three rate cuts by March 2024 to address the current inflation. However, some officials have signaled a willingness to raise interest rates further if inflation worsens. According to a Financial Times report, “Various participants mentioned a willingness to tighten policy further should risks to inflation materialise in a way that such an action became appropriate.” The likelihood of rate increases diminished following the subdued inflation over the past month. Nevertheless, concerns about persistent inflation in the U.S. economy remained high among central bank officials. As such, the Fed maintained interest rates at a 23-year high range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent during the May 1 meeting. This decision was unanimously supported by Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members. The post-meeting statement indicated that borrowing costs might remain elevated longer than anticipated. This move is due to disappointing inflation data from January to March, with rates still well above the Fed’s 2 percent target. The Fed officials also planned to enact restrictive policies if inflation did not decline to the target or ease policy restraint if the labor market weakened unexpectedly.

        "content": "DURBAN, South Africa — The 59-year-old Dumisani Ndlovu has voted in every South Africa national election since he and the rest of the Black majority finally won the right 30 years ago. He has faithfully supported the liberation party-turned-ruling party African National Congress every time. That ends on Wednesday. In a way, nostalgia is calling. Ndlovu in this week's election is turning his support to the man, Jacob Zuma, whose career spanned from the liberation struggle to the presidency before falling out with his ANC colleagues and reemerging last year with a new political party. That MK party, named after the ANC's old armed wing, shows how the 82-year-old Zuma is leveraging the past to rally South Africans' support against the ANC, which he himself once claimed would rule until ''Jesus comes back.'' Here in the heartland of Zuma supporters, the eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, cab driver Ndlovu has embraced the unlikely comeback of a political survivor after years of corruption allegations, criminal charges and prison. Even being barred from this election as a candidate for Parliament over a recent conviction hasn't blunted Zuma's influence. ''They think they have finished him, but we are with him all the way. The ANC will pay,'' Ndlovu said. It is a rallying cry that could, for the first time, force the ANC into a coalition to stay in power. The new party is fielding other candidates for Parliament and appears likely to win seats. Zuma has become the wild card of the election for Africa's most advanced country, six years after resigning South Africa's presidency under a cloud. His MK party was formed just over six months ago and yet is expected to drain significant support from the ANC, which already faced its sternest test. Zuma's credentials — he was in prison alongside Nelson Mandela for his work in the anti-apartheid movement — resonate especially in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal. Ndlovu, the cab driver, had backed the ANC since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994. Now, one of his grievances against the ANC is what he calls its ill-treatment of Zuma. ''He went to jail during apartheid and then they (the ANC) put him in jail again despite all his sacrifices. What kind of freedom is that?'' Ndlovu said. Zuma was sent to prison in 2021 after refusing to testify at an inquiry looking into alleged corruption in government during the time he was president from 2009-2018. He called that sentence an effort by the ANC to silence him. Zuma said last week's Constitutional Court decision to disqualify him from standing as a candidate was part of a grudge against him by the ruling party and the courts. The constitution doesn't allow anyone to stand for election if they have been sentenced to 12 months or more in prison without the option of a fine. ''I am going to fight for my rights until this country agrees that freedom must be a complete freedom, not for some and oppression for others,'' Zuma said. He now fights under the banner of the MK, which he has fashioned as the vanguard of anti-apartheid struggle ideals such as the distribution of land to Black people. The party's symbol is similar to the old ANC military wing's logo. Its full name is uMkhonto weSizwe, which means Spear of the Nation. The ANC took MK to court over its use of the name, which it claims it owns. MK won. It was another example of the ANC trying to silence him, Zuma said. Zuma's new party also looks to the future, promising jobs, free education and better healthcare for young people who make up the majority of the country's population. They have no memory of apartheid, but they have plenty of grievances about the deep inequality that remains. Zuma claims to be a truer version of the ANC and more dedicated to helping South Africa's poor Black majority. His party's branding has been welcomed by supporters for its anti-apartheid nostalgia. ''I have known uMkhonto all my life. It fought for freedom. It is there for us again this time,'' Ndlovu said. How such loyalty — and the ANC's irritation over it — might translate into votes will be seen on Wednesday. ''It might just make people want them (MK) more because the question that arises is, why put so much push against this party? There must be there something, and I think people are intrigued and they might just go out and vote for them,'' Sanet Madonsela-Solomon, a lecturer in the department of political sciences at the University of South Africa, told TV station eNCA this week. At MK's last major campaign rally over the weekend in KwaZulu-Natal, gray-haired men and women in military fatigues joined youthful supporters sporting skinny jeans and manicured nails. Together, they danced to old anti-apartheid struggle songs that evoked the hardships of that period. They praised late ANC icons like Mandela and criticized current ANC leaders. ''uMkhonto is not for the people of KwaZulu-Natal only, it is a calling for South Africa as whole,\" said one attendee, Siboniso Gwala. ''The spear is what will liberate this country. uMkhonto will liberate Black people.'' His 6-year-old son, Nkanyezi, was in tow, singing along and wearing a beret with MK's symbol — a warrior with a spear and shield. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa",

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than June 24, 2024 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Autodesk, Inc. lacked adequate internal controls as a result of issues with its free cash flow and non-GAAP operating margin practices; and (2) as a result, defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

        "description": "Eleven players for all top leagues",
        "content": "Yesterday, all seasons of the top European leagues ended. Eleven of our players gave fundamentally different and intense performances there. Among their achievements, they all appeared on the field and played a significant role in each of the clubs. OBOZ.UA tells about all the ups, downs, triumphs, and achievements. Victories and trophies in Spain The Catalan Ukrainians closed the season with a bang, showing who is the driving force behind Girona. After the first round and enchanting leadership, the team lost all its enthusiasm, let Real Madrid get close, and the eternal Spanish giants slipped ahead. In the last few months, the Girona team competed with Barcelona for silver. As a result, some Catalans took the first bronze medal in history, while others came in second and were left without a coach. And two Ukrainians showed character. In his first year in Spain, Dovbyk achieved several achievements: he was the tournament's top scorer (24 goals), one of the most-played players in the league, and the undisputed leader of the team. He is also among the best debutants in La Liga, with 24+8 in terms of assists, only Ronaldo was better in his first appearance for Real Madrid. Our striker is ahead of such players as Luis Suarez, Robert Lewandowski, Gareth Bale, and Radamel Falcao. Dovbyk also has goals for Barcelona and Atletico, several doubles, and two hat-tricks for Sevilla and Granada. In short, a memoir-like debut. Tsyhankov has been plagued by injuries three times, but his second year at Girona is better than the previous one. 8 goals and 7 assists are almost twice as many as in his first year. The quality translated into all the La Liga matches played when the midfielder was not in the infirmary. And how many times did the Tsyhankov-Dovbyk combination work with passes to each other! If Artem was a bright person, Viktor was a hard worker. And both closed the season on a major note with a performance against Granada. Lunin had an incredible season – he had been waiting for his chance for 4 years! And all to firmly push Courtois in the social networks and opinions of Real Madrid fans, and his phenomenal performances deprived even Kepa of his job, who was urgently acquired to replace the Belgian. Andrii has played 21 matches, including a dozen zeroes. Our goalkeeper helped Madrid catch up with Girona, gain a foothold at the top of the table, and win the individual championship in La Liga. The team also won the Super Cup with Lunin. Yes, the regular Cup was lost, but there is an equally cool memory of the season in the Champions League. The bonus from the Spanish season is a place in the goal of the Ukrainian national team in the decisive matches of the Euro qualifiers. There is still a very difficult personal question – to go or not? On the one hand, there is La Liga, which Real Madrid won largely with the participation of a Ukrainian. There is the Champions League final, which Madrid reached thanks to Lunin and his stunning performances (especially against Leipzig and Manchester City). However, Courtois has recovered and has already moved Andriy out of the goal, and Serlot has added doubts with his poker (although those goals raise more questions about the creamy center-backs). Lunin now has a lot to think about, because there are still a few days left until the CL final, but every day our hope of seeing the Ukrainian in goal is diminishing. Juve, Bayern Munich, and MU want to take the goalkeeper – now everything depends solely on the player himself. Yaremchuk also plays in Spain, also a La Liga debutant. It's incredible that Roman played as many as 25 matches for Valencia, but scored only three goals. There are several explanations for this: his rotation status, several injuries during the year, and more frequent substitutions. Roman did not appear on the field only twice this season, and the coach always found an opportunity to throw him into the battle. But the competition was lost – Duro was more stable and better. With the Ukrainian in the lineup, the team finished 9th, having long ago abandoned attempts to fight at least for the LC. We will remember Yaremchuk for his goal against Real Madrid. Whether Valencia will remember the striker is an open question, as there is too much time for adaptation. Will the bats leave the player in a very demanding position? English thriller for 5 clubs As many as five Ukrainians play in the English Premier League, and each has experienced his drama. Zinchenko was on his way to the championship with Arsenal, but the Gunners lost faith and allowed Manchester City to win the Premier League with their own hands; Oleksandr himself fell out of the lineup and had to prove to Arteta that he was worthy of starting again this summer. The grandees also have Mudryk – his first season in the world's best league was so unbalanced that among fans, Mykhailo jumped from player of the year status to the worst acquisition in history every time he took the field. Although it is worth noting that he scored 5 goals in three dozen matches, only 3 Chelsea players scored more than the Ukrainian. The competition was hotter in the basement. There, Zabarnyi, although he did not set a record for appearances in the Premier League among all clubs, won the Best Player award for Bournemouth. Mykolenko made us worry: his powerful performances for Everton barely helped the team stay in the Premier League. Similarly, Yarmoliuk in Brentford: this club decided to lose to everyone who is stronger than Luton and only the end of the season stopped the fall. It should be noted that they are the most ambitious in the Premier League. Italian colorfulness Empoli made a spectacular end to the round: being one step away from relegation, the team was able to beat Roma on their field and stay in the elite, taking only one point over Frosinone! Kovalenko was a substitute in the last match. In general, his performances are not impressive: in his 4th season in Serie A and his debut for Empoli, he started only 4 times, did not play a single match for a full game, and scored only once. At 28, if the midfielder wants to progress, he needs to change teams now. But we certainly won't forget that goal against Napoli: albeit the only one of the season, but what a goal! Malynowskyi was more successful at Genoa: he played 28 games, most of them from the start. The griffins secured their entry into Serie A with the 11th place in the table, and the player converted 1,500 minutes on the field into 4 goals and an assist. There is every chance that the team has found a good player for the center and the Ukrainian will stay in Italy. Malynowskyi himself commented on this period as \"doing everything to return to the national team.\" If there are more goals like the one against Bologna, Ruslan deserves to start. At least in a friendly with the Germans. The French-German lull But two championships do not know about Ukrainian football players. There was only the traitor Ordez, who almost got relegated from the Bundesliga with Bochum. Here we need to talk about the situation separately because the Germans have a relegation playoff – two matches for qualification. The opponent was the third team of the Second Bundesliga, Fortuna, which defeated the opponent 3-0 in the first match. It is said that this was due to the absence of Bochum's main goalkeeper. No one doubts that the Dusseldorf team will win the second one, and Fortuna's return to the German elite is much more pleasant than a non-Ukrainian playing in one of Europe's top leagues. There are a few Ukrainians in France, all of them outside the elite. The closest to Ligue 1 is Danylo Ihnatenko, who plays for Bordeaux. His team seemed to be near the Ligue 2 qualification zone all the time to compete for the elite in the playoffs. However, an unfortunate series of wins and losses left them in 12th place. By the standards of the table, this is very far below the middle. But in terms of points, it's only 9 points behind Paris, which has jumped into the qualifiers. Ihnatenko himself remains the main player in his third season at the club: 30 matches, a goal and an assist. All the others play very far down the French divisions.",

        "content": "Stormy Daniels revealed she has received death threats (Image: MySpace) President Donald Trump’s hush money trial is nearing its end, with closing arguments expected shortly. But for Stormy Daniels, the aptly named woman caught in the whirlwind, there’s no end to her ordeal, the Daily Mirror has revealed. Indeed, Trump may be the one on trial, but it’s Stormy who’s been judged every day for the past five years. And unlike Trump’s New York jury of his peers, Stormy’s being judged by those with little mercy, little care for evidence, and scant regard for Justice. function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) And with Trump making another run for The White House, she knows the haters and the abuse are only likely to get worse. READ MORE: Trump snaps back at booing crowd as he's branded 'worst president in history' [LATEST] Speaking from her home in Texas, Stormy says: “Back in 2018, there was stuff like ‘liar’, ‘slut’, ‘gold digger’. This time around, it’s different. “It is direct threats. It is ‘I’m going to come to your house to slit your throat’.” The intensified abuse and violent threats got worse after the decision to charge Trump over alleged hush money payments made to her. People have become so angry at her role in Trump’s potential downfall, that they have convinced themselves their beliefs and actions are valid. So much so, most are not even hiding their identities. “They’re not even using bot accounts, they’re using their real accounts,” she says. “I compare them to suicide bombers. They legitimately think that what they’re doing is right. Those people who see me as a villain. Earlier this month, Stormy, 45, testified in the criminal fraud trial of former President Trump (Image: GETTY) “It just makes me scratch my head and really question how they would want their daughters treated, or their sisters, or their mother.” Her comments are featured in a new TV documentary, Stormy, to be shown for the first time in the UK tonight [TUES] on Channel 5. It’s timed as the trial reaches its final stages. During a car ride, Stormy reads out some of the vile messages she has received including: “Even if you’d have been raped, you should have kept your mouth quiet for the greater good” and “You’re nothing but a fat hillbilly, Trump would never touch you, stop lying, before I’m forced to shut you up myself” She adds that that is a ‘direct threat’. Earlier this month, Stormy, 45, testified in the criminal fraud trial of former President Trump, where she made a number of bombshell claims about her alleged affair with him. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has accused Trump of falsifying business records to disguise an alleged $130,000 (£104,000) hush-money payment made to Daniels in a bid to hide damaging information just before the US election in 2016. Stormy, who married her fourth husband, Barret Blade, in December 2022, claimed that Trump would call her at least once a week during their affair and beg her to see him. She said he would “profess his love and beg to see me again”. Stormy - whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford - is then seen sitting at her kitchen table surrounded by piles of legal documents and praises her attorney, Clark Brewster. “There is a never ending avalanche of court documents, lawsuits and court transcripts”, she says. “I wanted to die. If I had all of these legal bills piled up. I would never have been able to pay them. And Clark is the only one who never charged me and kept fighting for me. I can’t even imagine where I would be.” Trending SUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I’m desensitised to some of it. But they’ve also become more violent with me. “I’m more prepared with my legal knowledge but I’m also tired. Like my soul is so tired.” She also described why she signed the NDA, claiming she was afraid for her family if she didn’t. For Stormy, she will just be pleased when this is finally over. Her life has been transformed but she’s determined not to give up. She says: “I won’t give up as I’m telling the truth. “And I kind of don’t know if that matters anymore.” Stormy premieres Tuesday, May 28, Channel 5, 10pm and is also available to stream on My5.

        "content": "Members of American Legion Post 38 place a wreath near the flag pole at the Mill Springs National Cemetery. The placement of the wreath was part of Monday's Memorial Day services. The dedication of those who have served our country and who have since passed away – in wartime and in times of peace – was honored Monday in a gathering at Mill Springs National Cemetery in Nancy. Those who wanted to pay tribute the men and women who served in the U.S. Military joined American Legion Post 38, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the members of the National Parks Service who oversee the Mill Springs Battlefield and Visitors Center in remembering all those who have gone before us. The ceremony was conducted as part of Memorial Day activities being held at both the National Cemetery and the Civil War-era battlefield. “Hundreds of thousands of Americans have died in preserving liberty and peace for our nation,” said main speaker Allen Boone, retired lieutenant colonel of the U.S. Army. LTC Ret. Allen Boone speaks to the crowd during Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony at Mill Springs. “The Civil War alone had over 700,000 men and women who died in service. Their sacrifices are etched in history, a solemn testament to their bravery and dedication. These men and women understood the meaning of putting others before self. They were dedicated to fulfill their mission at all costs. And as we ponder their sacrifices, our hearts should be filled with gratitude for their willingness to serve against foreign and domestic enemies who sought to destroy our nation,” Boone said. Boone himself has served in active duty, having been in two tours of duty in Iraq. Boone, who currently lives in Lexington, has a masters degree in Management and Leadership from Liberty University and is a graduate of Command and General Staff College. “This day is not just about a day of remembering,” Boone said. “It is time for us to act. As we honor their memory, we pledge that their lives, that their sacrifices, that their valor shall never be forgotten. Let us also pledge to do the utmost and carry out what must, and what they wished for us, in that no other generation of young men and women would have to share their experiences and repeat their sacrifice.” Clarence Floyd, American Legion Post 38 Chaplain, leads the crowd in prayer during Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony at Mill Springs National Cemetery. As part of Monday’s ceremony, American Legion Post 38 Chaplain Clarence Floyd led the crowd in a prayer, in which he said, “As we look across, and as we see all these white markers, Lord, we know that was one of our brothers or sisters, but Lord, they also had a family, and we pray for every one of them and for the life that they lived and for the influence they had on other people.” The ceremony proved bittersweet for Floyd, as he announced he would be retiring as chaplain soon, after 17 years of service with Post 38’s Color Guard. The Color Guard itself bookended the service, by both leading the opening parade which presented the colors, and by completing the service with a 21-gun salute and the playing of Taps. Members of the American Legion Post 38 Color Guard present the colors during the opening parade to Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony. Also during the ceremony, a commemorative wreath was placed at the cemetery’s flag pole, near the grave of Sgt. Brent Woods, a Buffalo Soldier who received the Congressional Medal of Honor after an event in August 1881 in which he saved the lives of his fellow soldiers.",

        "content": "Indian tennis star Sania Mirza, who is considered as a role model and source of inspiration by many for her talent and accomplishments, has redefined the role of women in the society. Though the women all over the world have outgrown the societal barriers and done wonders by their work in various fields, society in the South Asian countries still see females in limited roles. The 37-year-old sportswoman, who has seen the epitome of success and fame owing to her skills and brilliance as a professional tennis player, believes that the women are not just about beauty or their knack in the kitchen. Being a mother and a celebrity all at the same time, Sania is of the view that women are much more than what society wants them to be. “Women are not just supposed to look pretty and cook. They are more than that,” she told leading Indian magazine Famina in a recent interview. The quote was shared by the journal on their official Instagram and reshared by Sania on her Instagram stories. It may be noted that the Indian tennis ace is mother to six-year-old Izhaan Mirza Malik. Despite having taken retirement from professional tennis, Sania is widely followed for her charismatic personality and sparkling career.",

        "description": "His production has been trending down for a few years now and is at an especially low point this year. The 29-year-old has hit .143/.265/.229 thus far in 2024 while striking out 38.6 percent of the time.",
        "content": "The Guardians have released outfielder Ramon Laureano , according to his transactions tracker at MLB.com. He’ll now head to the open market and will be free to explore opportunities with all clubs. This was the most likely outcome when the Guardians designated Laureano for assignment last week. The outfielder’s production has been trending down for a few years now and is at an especially low point this year. The 29-year-old has hit .143/.265/.229 thus far in 2024 while striking out 38.6 percent of the time. On top of his poor performance, his salary has been creeping up gradually via the arbitration process. He’s making $5.15M this year and any team acquiring him via a waiver claim or trade would have been taking on that money. It’s unsurprising that no club wanted to take that on, given how he has been playing of late. He has more than five years of service time, meaning he can reject an outright assignment while also keeping that salary in place. Now that he is a free agent, teams may be interested in a low-cost flier. Since he’s now been released, the Guardians are on the hook for what’s left of the money, meaning that any club that signs him would only be responsible for the prorated league minimum for any time spent on the roster. That amount would be subtracted from what the Guards pay. It’s been a few years now, but Laureano was once a solid regular for the Athletics. From 2018 to 2021, he stepped to the plate 1,257 times for the A’s and hit 49 home runs. His .263/.335/.465 batting line translated to a wRC+ of 119, indicating he was 19 percent above league average in that time. He also stole 34 bases and was generally given strong defensive grades, leading FanGraphs to credit him with 8.6 wins above replacement in 313 games. But towards the end of that 2021 season, he was given an 80-game PED suspension and his performance has been tailing off since then. He hit .211/.287/.376 in 2022 for a wRC+ of 95 and his offense slipped a bit farther in 2023. The A’s designated him for assignment in August of last year and the Guards put in a claim. Moving to Cleveland seemed to spur a bit of a bounceback, as Laureano slashed .243/.342/.382 for a wRC+ of 106 down the stretch. That apparently intrigued the Guards enough that they tendered him a contract, agreeing to the aforementioned $5.15M salary. But he has fallen off dramatically and now finds himself looking for his next opportunity. As mentioned, Laureano can be signed to a major league roster at essentially no cost. Perhaps some club would give him a spot and see if he can play well enough over the next two months to be flipped for a lottery ticket prospect. Or even if no club is willing to bite on that, he should at least be able to find a minor-league deal somewhere. This article first appeared on MLB Trade Rumors and was syndicated with permission.",

        "content": "Director General of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, Prof Mojisola Adeyeye, tells LARA ADEJORO what the agency is doing regarding drug security, actions being taken against substandard products, among other issues How interesting or challenging has your job been since you assumed office in 2017? It has been a journey. First of all, I was away for 37 years, and I was able to function better, not because America is something special, but it is because the system allows you to think. Here, many factors can block the way you want to think to make things better. They call it the Nigerian factor, but I don’t call it the Nigerian factor; I call it stupidity. We don’t respect time. Time is money, and that is why we are poor, while other countries are rich. You have an appointment for 4pm, and you are coming at 6pm, and then you say let us pray. How? Let us pray to whom? Let us pray for what? God created the world in seven days, and that is a timeline, but we don’t keep to time. That is one challenging thing, but you know I give it to my staff in NAFDAC. I observe that they keep to time from the beginning, and the problem with time is with the larger society; not with the NAFDAC staff. Again, we don’t have respect for money at all. The way I was brought up is to have respect for money, to know that money does many good things if that money is respected, don’t worship money, I am not talking of worshiping money; it is knowing that with money, you can change many things if you respect money, you don’t let it fly away through corruption, you don’t let it fly away through negligence, you don’t let it fly away through bad leadership or bad governance. I find that widely challenging in the greater society. We don’t have a sense of responsibility and accountability. If you give me N10, I am supposed to account to you on how I spent the N10. I have sent people errands with N1,000 and they bought the product for N750, and they just walked away, I asked them for my balance because if I want to give it to you, I will give it to you; do not just walk away with my money. How did we get to this point? We don’t have a sense of accountability, and it has permeated the whole society – from the home, to the church, to the mosque, and to wherever we work, it is a problem. In terms of NAFDAC, the challenge is a lack of cohesion and team effort. You cannot work in a regulatory system and be an island, but a silo mentality destroys the civil service. People keep to what they know, they don’t like to share. In a regulatory system where approval of drugs is dependent on about five to six directorates, and you are now keeping it to yourself, I find that very challenging. Some people don’t know or don’t want to work together but we are changing that. I tell my staff to see this as we are one, whether we have 26 directorates or not, we are one. We are going towards the one goal to make sure that the medicine, food, or whatever that we approve are of quality, and one person cannot do that. We have a country where NAFDAC was removed from the ports for seven years, and our mandate is to control imports and exports. Then you removed NAFDAC. What was the consequence of removing NAFDAC from the ports? So, everybody started dumping everything they wanted. They tell themselves to go to Nigeria and there has been no gateman there for seven years, and we have not finished mopping the mess because of the cabal they have formed, and that is a big challenge. We replaced passion with money. You can have a project and if you think it is money first, that project is not going to be successful; that doesn’t mean that that project doesn’t need money, but you have to put passion, goals, objectives, and strategic plans in the project. Look at the project and ask yourself where you are going, and what your expectations are at the end of the time. Those are the key performance indicators. But it is money first for them, and it is a disease in the whole world. Nigeria has the highest number of uncompleted projects in Africa because before the money gets to the hand of the contractor, most of it is gone. What is also challenging is what I see as an oath of silence when bad things are happening. I was telling a friend the other day that we were ruled for almost 40 years by the military, and you could not criticise. People may die; so, people don’t talk maybe because of fear or maybe because things started degenerating at home. When children start controlling their parents, why wouldn’t they start abusing drugs? When parents cannot discipline a child, these are challenging things. However, when I see challenges, I see opportunities. We have had debt of over N3.2bn, and another N500m that they could not figure how, that’s a challenge. You cannot build a strong agency without money. How were you able to clear this debt? I saw that as an opportunity, and I said we were going to pay back, they said nobody pays back money in Nigeria, but I promised we would pay back, and everybody would know we paid back. For two or three years, I said we could save here to buy vehicles, we could save here for computers, I was making people think about how to respect money. The thinking was that if we saved this money, we could use it for good things. We have been doing that. We saved money to buy computers, equipment, and vehicles; these are not luxuries for us; they are tools. In one year, we paid back N3.2bn, people couldn’t believe it. People said NAFDAC had money and that we did not need support, but I argued that we didn’t have because we had to pay back the debt. What other challenging situation did you meet on the ground when you assumed office as the NAFDAC DG? Before my arrival, there was about N5bn that was evaded from the port; people who were supposed to pay, maybe they have given bribes and walked away. We started pursuing them and we were able to recover about N800m. Some of the companies had wrong addresses, our staff used motorcycle to get to some places they described as their addresses. Some of these places were not motorable, and they would find out that it was somewhere in the bush. That evaded payment has stopped because we digitalised our port inspection system. Another challenge is staff members are so talented but are just sitting down, not being challenged to go higher. For me, I don’t care where you are from, as long as you have something to contribute, something that is going to add value to our system. Of course, people are relocating abroad now, not because NAFDAC is not doing something but because the economy is not there yet. So, human capital is a challenge. Another challenge of course was computers not being available for directors, not a single director had a computer. Computers where I lived for decades are like paper that you have to use; it’s like pen, and yet a director didn’t have it. It is money that we respect that we use to buy computers. Another challenge was the laboratory; the equipment was uninstalled or badly installed, and nobody was paying attention. So, I knew we needed to buy equipment to test products. A challenge also was that we had a very bad image, even internationally. So, we started working on image-making, rebranding, and explaining. They were surprised that we stopped coming with sirens into their countries. That bad image has changed completely. When we go to meetings, they know that we are there, not because we are the last to enter but because of what we need to share and present. People know that you are joking when you go to just blow hot air, but that has changed. These days, as you are talking, people are already googling your name and the topic you are talking about. There is nothing hidden now. People now respect NAFDAC; we are leading in Africa, not because we are now on Maturity Level 3, but because in the comity of nations, we have something to share. Of course, ML3 is good, our laboratory is great, and we are working hard, and we have the information to share. Thank God I have staff members who are cooperating because they know we have a task to do. Recently, you banned alcohol in sachets, PET, and glass bottles of 200ml and below, but that raised concerns from labour unions, manufacturers, and even lawmakers who said you should lift the ban. What are you doing to strike a balance to ensure that the ban is not hurting businesses and the health of Nigerians is also safeguarded? Well, our mandate is to control the importation, exportation, manufacturing, advertisement, sale, and use of food, drugs, cosmetics, medical devices, chemicals, and packaged water. In 2010, Nigeria with 193 countries signed that they would not make alcohol easily accessible to young people. But we don’t dare to stand by it. Why do we have children that have become alcoholics before they get to the university if they ever get to the university? Children are well disposed to substance abuse, and parents have to lock their doors because they don’t know what their children can do to them at night. We have children who are mentally ill because you will expose a child to alcohol at a young age. I am not against alcohol; I take occasional wine. They said why can’t children have identity cards, so they don’t sell to them. Where, in Nigeria? In a system that works, yes. In the United States, you cannot buy cigarettes, you will show your identity card because they will quote your identity on the computer, and it shows that it is genuine. Does that mean we will not get there? We will, but maybe in 50 years. We have children now who have cancer because their livers have been compromised, because of early alcohol use. We have young people having kidney problems. We are not robots with metals; we are human beings, we have organs, and when the organs start taking alcohol, they start breaking down with time. It was 2018, and they said their businesses would collapse, and we said we would give them five years to figure out how they would arrange their businesses. The reality is that there are still some people working at those companies, but the years given to them are suddenly not enough for them. We don’t think of the next generation, we think of the money we need immediately. Whether we kill somebody or not, we just need money immediately. In terms of the ban, it is a ministerial directive, and the minister is in charge of that now. So, it is between the executive and the legislature. The executive will determine the next line of action. It has also been observed that despite the ban, we still have people selling and buying these products. What are you doing to ensure that people adhere to the ban? Time will tell, let us just put it that way. What are you doing regarding drug security in the country? We were taught a lesson during the pandemic that we are naked as a country because we were addicted to importation. We have this colonial mentality that if it is not bought from outside, it is not good. It was not like that before. In terms of drug security, we have changed the paradigm, we are encouraging local manufacturing, and we are telling them that they can. Now, we have companies that are trying to manufacture the active ingredients. Before, the only thing we manufacture is water. We could not even manufacture starch to bind the things together but now, things are changing, because without a change in mindset, we will continue to have drug insecurity. We now have regulatory directives; if you have been importing or we have been giving you renewals, the last renewal will be the last. If you can make it in Nigeria, you must migrate to local manufacturing. If you can make it in Nigeria, and you don’t have money for a new company, you can partner with companies that are already doing the same thing that you are importing; that is drug security. We are encouraging our companies in terms of the quality of the medicines because it is not just having medicines; it is that they must be of quality because that is drug security. If you are making bad medicines as a local manufacturer, we will shut you down. Drug security is not just about making a lot of drugs in the country, it is about making a lot of drugs with quality, and that we have already established. If any company violates it, they will pay for it, either temporarily or permanently. We have shut some companies down permanently because it is better to have companies that will be sustained and will be in here for 10 or 20 years with quality maintained, and that is part of how we will ensure drug security. Then, decrease the imports, and increase local manufacturing based on international standards. Despite your efforts to regulate and control illicit drugs, and cosmetics, among others, Nigeria is still bedevilled by hawking of unregistered and illicit drugs, importation, sale, and use. How can this war be won in the country? First, it is not only NAFDAC that is responsible for the control of drugs. The Pharmacy Council of Nigeria is the one that gives licences to anywhere drug is being sold. Now, the two agencies are cooperating better; they control downstream, and we control both downstream and upstream. We control downstream because if anybody has illicit medicine, and we know, we can close that shop. So, there is more collaboration now between PCN and NAFDAC. That is part of why we are successful in Kano because we moved those who had been selling medicines openly in the market to a coordinated site where we can monitor them better. How can we win this war against illicit drugs and other counterfeit products? We are winning already. We cannot win overnight. First of all, substandard medicines are global. So, it is not just in Nigeria. It is all over; it is that it is higher in Africa than in other continents because we look forward to getting medicines from Asia, China, or India, whereas we are supposed to be thinking of making more medicines in our countries. So, winning the war is not a sprint, it is a marathon. We just want to make sure that we decrease as much as possible the prevalence of medicines that are bad in the country; we want to make sure that it goes down to less than five per cent. Right now, it is about 12 per cent which is still not good enough, but it is better than 17 per cent or 40 per cent. It used to be like 40 per cent years ago before my time, then they started decreasing it. Last year, you signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Health Insurance Authority on strengthening local drug manufacturing and ensuring quality and access to affordable drugs. How far has that partnership gone, especially now that the costs of medications keep skyrocketing? There are companies that we qualified based on their records that NHIA chose their drugs to be made available for Health Maintenance Organisations in their insurance scheme, and that is still there, but that will encourage more local manufacturing because the government will be patronising, which is part of the executive order that we should patronise our local manufacturers. So, the NHIA partnership is one of the examples where local manufacturers will continue to be patronised. The Minister of State for Health and Social Welfare, Dr Tunji Alausa, recently called for a ban on the importation of syringes. Does Nigeria have the capacity to produce the needed syringes, and don’t you think if we start producing the syringes here, it will be costlier? First of all, we can produce the syringes that we need in the country, but we need more producers of syringes. Whether we have 20 or five producers of syringes, they’ve got to be of quality. If they don’t have quality, we will not approve them because it is not only what we need in the country, but also what we can sell. If you think that it is just for us, then how do we improve our forex? How can we export if it is not of quality? We will continue to import; it is not 100 per cent dependent on the import that we are working against. If we have products that are of quality like syringes, they may be costly at a point, and the government doesn’t say you should not bring syringes, it is that the Customs must enforce the high tariff that has been placed on syringes. The government didn’t ban syringes from being imported, it is that they place such a customs duty very high to discourage it. That doesn’t mean they will not come in, but they want to discourage bringing it in because they know we can produce syringes. You earlier said over 70 per cent of Nigerian foods are rejected abroad. What could be the reasons for this? What type of foods are being rejected and what is the agency doing to ensure that the foods meet international standards? Silo mentality is what is killing us in Nigeria. One ministry does not want to work with another ministry, or one agency does not want to work with another agency; and corruption. Somebody is an exporter, and that person has been sold a lie that they will help them get what they have exported. They think other countries are as corrupt as we are. Ninety-five per cent, if not 99 or 100 per cent of products that are rejected never came to NAFDAC because of short cut. However, we are doing a lot; we have revised our expectation guidelines and regulations. We are more proactive now, and we work with agencies that are responsible for exportation to let them know that NAFDAC is there. We also sell ourselves short in this country. NAFDAC has the best set of laboratories in the whole of Nigeria, but some people will tell people not to go to NAFDAC. We have the best set of laboratories in the countries, but people will not come, and we even test free, but we have to also be more visible. People export without quality testing. Beans were banned before my time, but we are working hard as we speak to ensure that the ban is lifted. Once it is lifted, we export more; we get more forex, and we become better, and the Naira will appreciate. All these things are tied together but if it is myself and me alone mentality, it will be difficult to do, but we are working hard and reaching out to other agencies responsible for exports. Sesame seeds are another type that is rejected. However, we are having a series to sensitise our people not to burn their hard-earned money. Again, we are making sure that we become more vocal and more visible in terms of our roles as an agency in charge of exports of foods, drugs, and others. Since you assumed office, how many drug stores selling unregistered products, factories, and warehouses storing substandard products have been sealed or shut and how many persons carrying out dangerous activities have been arrested? Hundreds of people have been arrested. In terms of reported cases, the number is about 4,000. The number of cases concluded is about 922, and the number of cases pending is about 3,000 because of our court system. We have carried out over 2,000 surveillance activities. The number of samples from arrests is about 15,100. We also carry out destruction exercises, which are part of the enforcement activities. We have done about 20; we have carried out over 15,100 interrogations. We have arrested hundreds of hawkers. The most important thing to know is that NAFDAC is working; we are doing what we are supposed to do, even though we have very little staff. We are supposed to have about 12,000 staff members, but we have only 2,000. It is the staff members who do the enforcement, inspection, and surveillance, but despite that, we are still working very hard, and it is showing in our results. Incidents of substandard medicines are going down, and the number of new manufacturing companies going up. The war against fake drugs can be dangerous. Do you receive threats and how do you protect your staff? NAFDAC staff member has been attacked physically before; one of our staff’s daughters was kidnapped but mercifully, she escaped. We have received death threats, but this is what the country needs to hear when we talk of hazards and compensate us. Our staff members are not very well paid despite all these hazards, and exposure. But we are moving on. In Africa, we are the biggest, and we let our ports become a haven for criminals for seven years, and it is not like that in most countries in Africa, because they cannot remove regulatory agencies from the ports, but it happened in Nigeria, and we are still trying to mop up the mess that that left.",

        "description": "Former South African President Jacob Zuma is the wild card in Wednesday’s election for Africa’s most advanced country. He leads a new political party that's draining support from the ruling African National Congress that he once said would rule until...",
        "content": "DURBAN, South Africa (AP) — The 59-year-old Dumisani Ndlovu has voted in every South Africa national election since he and the rest of the Black majority finally won the right 30 years ago. He has faithfully supported the liberation party-turned-ruling party African National Congress every time. That ends on Wednesday. In a way, nostalgia is calling. Ndlovu in this week's election is turning his support to the man, Jacob Zuma , whose career spanned from the liberation struggle to the presidency before falling out with his ANC colleagues and reemerging last year with a new political party . That MK party, named after the ANC's old armed wing, shows how the 82-year-old Zuma is leveraging the past to rally South Africans' support against the ANC, which he himself once claimed would rule until “Jesus comes back.” Here in the heartland of Zuma supporters, the eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, cab driver Ndlovu has embraced the unlikely comeback of a political survivor after years of corruption allegations, criminal charges and prison. Even being barred from this election as a candidate for Parliament over a recent conviction hasn't blunted Zuma's influence. “They think they have finished him, but we are with him all the way. The ANC will pay,” Ndlovu said. It is a rallying cry that could, for the first time, force the ANC into a coalition to stay in power. The new party is fielding other candidates for Parliament and appears likely to win seats. Zuma has become the wild card of the election for Africa's most advanced country, six years after resigning South Africa's presidency under a cloud. His MK party was formed just over six months ago and yet is expected to drain significant support from the ANC, which already faced its sternest test. Zuma's credentials — he was in prison alongside Nelson Mandela for his work in the anti-apartheid movement — resonate especially in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal. Ndlovu, the cab driver, had backed the ANC since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994. Now, one of his grievances against the ANC is what he calls its ill-treatment of Zuma. “He went to jail during apartheid and then they (the ANC) put him in jail again despite all his sacrifices. What kind of freedom is that?” Ndlovu said. Zuma was sent to prison in 2021 after refusing to testify at an inquiry looking into alleged corruption in government during the time he was president from 2009-2018. He called that sentence an effort by the ANC to silence him. Zuma said last week's Constitutional Court decision to disqualify him from standing as a candidate was part of a grudge against him by the ruling party and the courts. The constitution doesn't allow anyone to stand for election if they have been sentenced to 12 months or more in prison without the option of a fine. “I am going to fight for my rights until this country agrees that freedom must be a complete freedom, not for some and oppression for others,” Zuma said. He now fights under the banner of the MK, which he has fashioned as the vanguard of anti-apartheid struggle ideals such as the distribution of land to Black people. The party’s symbol is similar to the old ANC military wing’s logo. Its full name is uMkhonto weSizwe, which means Spear of the Nation. The ANC took MK to court over its use of the name, which it claims it owns. MK won. It was another example of the ANC trying to silence him, Zuma said. Zuma's new party also looks to the future, promising jobs, free education and better healthcare for young people who make up the majority of the country’s population. They have no memory of apartheid, but they have plenty of grievances about the deep inequality that remains. Zuma claims to be a truer version of the ANC and more dedicated to helping South Africa’s poor Black majority. His party's branding has been welcomed by supporters for its anti-apartheid nostalgia. “I have known uMkhonto all my life. It fought for freedom. It is there for us again this time,” Ndlovu said. How such loyalty — and the ANC's irritation over it — might translate into votes will be seen on Wednesday. “It might just make people want them (MK) more because the question that arises is, why put so much push against this party? There must be there something, and I think people are intrigued and they might just go out and vote for them,” Sanet Madonsela-Solomon, a lecturer in the department of political sciences at the University of South Africa, told TV station eNCA this week. At MK's last major campaign rally over the weekend in KwaZulu-Natal, gray-haired men and women in military fatigues joined youthful supporters sporting skinny jeans and manicured nails. Together, they danced to old anti-apartheid struggle songs that evoked the hardships of that period. They praised late ANC icons like Mandela and criticized current ANC leaders. “uMkhonto is not for the people of KwaZulu-Natal only, it is a calling for South Africa as whole,\" said one attendee, Siboniso Gwala. “The spear is what will liberate this country. uMkhonto will liberate Black people.” His 6-year-old son, Nkanyezi, was in tow, singing along and wearing a beret with MK’s symbol — a warrior with a spear and shield.

The constitution doesn’t allow anyone to stand for election if they have been sentenced to 12 months or more in prison without the option of a fine. “I am going to fight for my rights until this country agrees that freedom must be a complete freedom, not for some and oppression for others,” Zuma said. He now fights under the banner of the MK, which he has fashioned as the vanguard of anti-apartheid struggle ideals such as the distribution of land to Black people. The party’s symbol is similar to the old ANC military wing’s logo. Its full name is uMkhonto weSizwe, which means Spear of the Nation. The ANC took MK to court over its use of the name, which it claims it owns. MK won. It was another example of the ANC trying to silence him, Zuma said. Zuma’s new party also looks to the future, promising jobs, free education and better healthcare for young people who make up the majority of the country’s population. They have no memory of apartheid, but they have plenty of grievances about the deep inequality that remains. Zuma claims to be a truer version of the ANC and more dedicated to helping South Africa’s poor Black majority. His party’s branding has been welcomed by supporters for its anti-apartheid nostalgia. “I have known uMkhonto all my life. It fought for freedom. It is there for us again this time,” Ndlovu said. How such loyalty — and the ANC’s irritation over it — might translate into votes will be seen on Wednesday. “It might just make people want them (MK) more because the question that arises is, why put so much push against this party? There must be there something, and I think people are intrigued and they might just go out and vote for them,” Sanet Madonsela-Solomon, a lecturer in the department of political sciences at the University of South Africa, told TV station eNCA this week. At MK’s last major campaign rally over the weekend in KwaZulu-Natal, gray-haired men and women in military fatigues joined youthful supporters sporting skinny jeans and manicured nails. Together, they danced to old anti-apartheid struggle songs that evoked the hardships of that period. They praised late ANC icons like Mandela and criticized current ANC leaders. “uMkhonto is not for the people of KwaZulu-Natal only, it is a calling for South Africa as whole,” said one attendee, Siboniso Gwala. “The spear is what will liberate this country. uMkhonto will liberate Black people.” His 6-year-old son, Nkanyezi, was in tow, singing along and wearing a beret with MK’s symbol — a warrior with a spear and shield. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa",

        "description": "\"It's important to do a lot of these early clinical studies with viruses that pose a pandemic risk now, instead of in a pandemic,\" said Scott Hensley, a Penn professor of microbiology.",
        "content": "University of Pennsylvania researchers have developed an mRNA vaccine for the H5N1 avian flu drawing increasing scrutiny by public health officials. The vaccine is effective against the virus in mice and ferrets, according to a new study published Thursday. The Penn team is using the same technique that powered the speedy development of a COVID-19 vaccine when a novel virus turned into a global pandemic. The highly virulent strain of avian flu currently poses little risk to people. But it has infected millions of birds around the country in the last several years, including flocks in Pennsylvania. In March, the virus began turning up in herds of dairy cattle, eventually spreading to nine states. Pennsylvania and New Jersey have not seen avian flu outbreaks in cattle; the closest reported cases are in Ohio. H5N1 so far is not highly contagious among humans. Still, its jump between domestic animals is a concern for public health officials, who fear the virus could mutate to more easily infect humans. The second case of H5N1 in a person in the United States was reported Wednesday by federal authorities. The two known cases involve a pair of agricultural workers in Texas and in Michigan. The potential for further spread in people underscores why it's important for researchers to develop new vaccines and test their safety before the virus could make that leap, said Scott Hensley, a Penn professor of microbiology and the study's corresponding author. \"It's important to do a lot of these early clinical studies with viruses that pose a pandemic risk now, instead of in a pandemic,\" he said. The Penn research team that developed the vaccine includes Drew Weissman, who with his colleague Katalin Karikó won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2023 for their development of the technique that modifies messenger RNA, or mRNA, to instruct cells to build immunity against viruses. The same technique that led to the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines was used to create the new H5N1 vaccine featured in Thursday's study in Nature Communications. Like with the COVID vaccines, the Penn researchers used mRNA to instruct the immune system to build antibodies against a specific protein in the H5N1 virus that allows it to attach to cells and replicate within the body. \"The antibodies stick to the outside of the virus, so it can no longer get into cells,\" Hensley said. Without mRNA technology, a more conventional flu vaccine would get produced by injecting the virus into a fertilized chicken egg, allowing the virus to replicate, and then deactivating it for use in a vaccine. The benefit of mRNA vaccines, though, is that they can be produced and modified very quickly — crucial in a rapidly changing pandemic environment. \"If it [H5N1] were to jump into humans and cause a human pandemic, it would be very easy to modify that vaccine that we have now,\" he said. \"There are so many advantages of this tech — the ability to quickly update and scale up, and not having a dependence on fertilized chicken eggs, which is a tricky process.\" The researchers' new H5N1 vaccine produced a high antibody response in mice and ferrets, Hensley said, adding that researchers tested the vaccine on mice who had never been exposed to the flu and mice who had been exposed to seasonal flu viruses to better replicate how the vaccine would perform in humans. The researchers also saw high antibody responses in another group of mice inoculated with an H5N1 vaccine produced in a more conventional manner. The group expects to begin tests on cattle, pigs, and chickens within weeks. Penn researchers are not the only group working on developing H5N1 vaccines. Moderna is currently testing an H5N1 mRNA vaccine, and federal officials have said they have limited stockpiles of conventional H5N1 vaccine candidates as well. Hensley said he's concerned about the H5N1 virus's potential to mutate: \"Scientists get nervous because we've seen it happen historically where these viruses change — with one or two viral mutations, that can change the whole equation on pandemic risk,\" he said. But the current strain of H5N1 appears to pose little risk to the public, health officials say. \"Everyone doesn't need to run to the pharmacy and stock up on toilet paper right now,\" Hensley said. The researchers' initial goal was to produce a vaccine that was effective in humans, but Hensley said the group also sees potential for their new vaccine in inoculating livestock. If H5N1′s spread can be halted or slowed in livestock, the virus will have less of an opportunity to mutate and potentially affect humans. \"It's important to protect livestock to reduce the amount of virus replicating in animals — which would also reduce the risk to humans,\" he said. Federal health officials are preparing two possible bird flu vaccines that can be distributed quickly if the virus spreads to humans.

        "content": "A lightning strike in Colorado killed a rancher and 34 of his cows in Jackson County on Saturday, adding to the death toll of devastating storms that have swept across the US over Memorial Day weekend. The strike killed 51-year-old Mike Morgan on his property in Rand, about 120 miles northwest of Denver , at the end of “branding day,” when members of the community typically pitch in to help brand cattle, according news outlets. He was feeding cattle hay when the bolt hit him and knocked around 100 cows off their feet. An initial 911 call was placed about 2am MT. “The 32 cattle did not get back up,” coroner George Crocket told The Colorado Sun . “As best I can tell, it hit him on the trailer. The cattle were bunched up around the trailer and it hit them all.” The National Weather Service had warned that a storm was moving across the Front Range Urban Corridor and urged people to go inside upon hearing thunder. Morgan’s death comes as at least 21 other people died over Memorial Day weekend in storms and tornadoes that hit the central US. Despite the tragedy, deadly lightning strikes remain rare. There are about 50 lightning fatalities a year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates, and the odds of being struck by lightning are one in a million. Ninety percent of victims survive. But working outside can put you at greater risk. Data from the US Centers of Disease and Control shows that there were 444 lightning strike deaths in the US between 2006 and 2021, with deaths being most common in the summer. Florida, Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Missouri, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have reported the most lightning deaths and injuries. Florida is considered to be the “lightning capital” of the US, with more than 2,000 lightning-related injuries occuring there in the past 50 years. Since 2006, only five states: Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, New Hampshire, Washington and the US Virgin Islands have reported zero deaths.",

        "content": "New Brunswick volunteer ride programs will soon be able to more efficiently take bookings and dispatch drives with the help of an artificial intelligence platform. Urban/Rural Rides, a charity which provides transportation to seniors, low-income families and people with moderate disabilities, will roll out the software province-wide by the end of the year. Executive director Kelly Taylor said the technology will make the process of booking rides and assigning volunteer drivers \"way more efficient.\" \"If somebody's coming into Moncton from another region and staying overnight, then a Moncton driver can help take that person home,\" she said. On Monday, the New Brunswick government announced a commitment of $2 million over four years. Urban/Rural Rides will be working on the project with Blaise Transit, a Montreal-based company that offers software for transit networks. Blaise Transit CEO Justin Hunt said the platform will give riders the ability to book rides closer to when they need to go somewhere, since artificial intelligence will be doing the dispatching. (Alexandre Silberman/CBC) The software is designed to help the regional service commissions manage the volunteer ride services, with everything from dispatching to monitoring operations in real time. There's also an app for drivers that guides the volunteers along their routes. It offers turn-by-turn directions, tells them who to pick up and what the passengers' mobility needs are. WATCH | New AI-powered volunteer ride software : Need a ride in N.B.? Artificial intelligence will book you one 1 hour ago Duration 1:26 Urban/Rural Rides, a charity which provides transportation to seniors, low-income families and people with moderate disabilities, will release a provincial dispatch platform by the end of the year. For clients, they will now have several options for booking rides. They can make a request through the Blaise Transit app or on a website. For people without access to devices, they can still call and speak with a dispatcher, who will put the request into the software for them. Blaise Transit CEO Justin Hunt said the platform will give riders more flexibility to manage their commutes themselves. \"Right now in a lot of these communities people have to call in quite far in advance because there's humans planning this manually on the other end, and so there needs to be a lot of lead time,\" he said. Hunt said the \"tedious\" work volunteers currently do to co-ordinate rides will be handled by artificial intelligence, giving them time to dedicate elsewhere. \"They can reinvest that time into adding more services and improving the accessibility at a greater scale,\" he said. New Brunswick will become one of the first areas in Canada to roll out artificial intelligence-powered software for volunteer ride programs on a province-wide scale, according to Hunt. Executive director Kelly Taylor said the technology will make the process of booking rides and assigning volunteer drivers “way more efficient.” (Bader Ben Amara/Radio-Canada) Blaise Transit previously launched the technology in 24 municipalities in Nova Scotia and 40 other municipalities across Canada and the United States. Regional Development Corporation Minister Réjean Savoie said it is important to increase access to transit, particularly in rural areas. \"People without a car, older people, people that need to go for medical reasons, or just for shopping. This will help have accessibility to transit for everybody in the province,\" he said. Urban/Rural Rides has been working on the project over the past year. Taylor said the program will help the province's existing regional volunteer ride programs to work together and share resources. \"Some of our volunteer groups in other regions have one employee, and that employee can never take vacation because nobody can help them,\" she said. \"So having everybody on the same platform will allow that opportunity for vacation covers or supporting each other.\" The platform is expected to be rolled out gradually to all 12 of the province's regional service commissions by the end of the year. Some areas could see the software in use as early as July.",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of the league’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times’ bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.” It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” He also considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He considered Bill Russell his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach.",

        "description": "Dr Ana Jeelani, from Didsbury, was sent to save children in Palestine",
        "content": "A surgeon who flew out to Gaza to save children caught up in the conflict says she didn’t write a will before she went – she only cared about who would get her match ticket if she didn’t return home. Dr Ana Jeelani, a consultant paediatric orthopaedic surgeon at Alder Hey Hospital, took on a two-week volunteer placement at Al-Aqsa hospital back in March. The 38-year-old, from Didsbury , kept the trip a secret right until she left in fear her loved ones would try and stop her from going. Join our WhatsApp Top Stories and Breaking News group by clicking this link And while the surgeon didn’t organise a will ahead of heading into the warzone, she did make arrangements for one thing – her sought-after Liverpool FC ticket. The avid fan says she wanted to ensure her ticket to see Liverpool play Wolverhampton at Anfield on Sunday (May 19) in Jürgen Klopp’s final match as manager. “People asked me if I had made a will,” she said. “The only thing I made provisions for in case I didn’t come back was my ticket to Jurgen Klopp’s final match at Anfield. I got it for about £47 in the ballot but then it was worth something like £20,000. Dr Ana Jeelani in Gaza “Only one person has access to my account apart from me – I told him ‘If I die, my ticket can’t be sold,’ and I gave him a list of true supporters who could take it. “Beyond that, I didn’t really think about whether or not I might come back from Gaza. You just don’t know – there’s no pattern to this conflict. I just thought, if my time’s come, my time’s come. I’ve done something worthwhile, and equally you could die being hit by a bus in Didsbury. “If you’re going to go, you might as well do something you’d be proud of. Wherever you stand on the conflict, 15,000 children are dead and we’re children’s doctors. We can’t ignore that.” Ana says she didn’t tell her family she was leaving right until she was set to depart – her parents begging her not to go in fear she wouldn’t come home. “I only told my parents I was going shortly before I left,” she said. “In fact, I got my sister to tell them. “They pleaded with me not to go. My mum rang me in floods of tears saying, ‘Don’t go, why are you doing this to us?’ “But they also knew that I had the resolve and I was going to go. They were frantic with worry, but they’re also very proud.” Ana Jeelani (Image: Dr Ana Jeelani) Ana says she witnessed the atrocities of what was happening in Gaza in the media and wanted to help in any way she could. Ahead of flying out with MAP, Medical Air for Palestinians, she underwent two days of security training in Egypt, learning skills including what to do if she were taken hostage and how to escape under rubble. “The hospital was chaotic,” she said. “There were 166 beds and around 800 inpatients. Families would tend to their injured, basically living in the hospital, some would bring in stoves to cook food, and all this is in the ward or the corridor, all mixed up together. “There’s no nutrition, no specialised mattresses for pressure wounds, some of the beds don’t even have mattresses. The wounds are contaminated and most of the wounds become infected.” Ana says the lights would randomly go out in the middle of operating – forcing them to use head torches they carried in their pockets. The trauma she witnessed left Ana suffering from insomnia for two weeks upon her return to the UK. “Alder Hey were really supportive of me going,” she added. “Giving me humanitarian leave to go and arranging counselling when I got back. I had very bad insomnia for about two weeks afterwards but what has really helped, as well as the counselling, is staying in touch with the team. “We had such a good team and all get on really well. We speak most days on WhatsApp. It really helps to speak to others who have been through the same thing, who have that shared experience.” Ana has suffered from poor mental health since returning home (Image: Dr Ana Jeelani) But among the horrors she saw, Ana says there were moments of joy, from waking to the sound of children laughing to the first time she was able to wash her hair. \"There were always moments of simple joy to be had. We felt like a proper family. I never felt homesick. I have left my heart there. I don’t think I can ever fully mentally recover from it until the situation is over.’ “The children are brilliant – there was this little kid who would follow me around in his wheelchair and say that the fact that I didn’t give him any money was a humanitarian issue – he didn’t know what it meant - it was just something he’d learnt. “He was so cute. His family had been killed and he was being looked after by the people in the next beds to him. They all look after each other. “And then there was a Ziko – a child of about 11 who hung around A&E and would help out when there were mass casualties, passing plaster and dunking it. “He kind of found us and latched on to us so we made him some little scrubs. He was such a good kid but seeing things he shouldn’t be seeing. We don’t know much about him – he lived in a tent and was always hanging around the hospital. “When we left, we gave them everything. We gave them our suitcases, our shoes, some gave their phones. We arrived with 52 suitcases in as a team of seven full of supplies, we left with one each. Anything we had on us, we gave.” Ana says there was no fresh food during her time in Gaza, with all produce arriving into the city going rotten before it had the chance to sell. “I heard about a colleague’s wife who queued for half an hour and paid $35 for six eggs,” she said. “When she cracked them open, they were all rotten. They’re living on canned food.” The surgeon says there’s one thing she noticed that doesn’t come across in the media – the hope that the conflict will soon come to an end. “The resilience that the Palestinian people have,” she said. “They just want to get on with their lives. It’s a beautiful place, people are so loving and lovely. “When we were leaving, a guy said that even if we hadn’t operated on a single patient, the fact that we came here and let them know that they’re not alone means more than anything. “Everything on social media depicts the horrors, but it doesn’t depict the heart.”",

        "content": "A McMaster University professor in Hamilton, Ont., acquitted of sexual assault in 2022, has lost his job with the post secondary institution. Scott Watter, who taught in the psychology, neuroscience and behaviour (PNB) department, has been “removed” from the university’s faculty, according to two McMaster executives. The institution’s president David Farrar and board chair Jane Allen in a joint statement insisted that Watter “abused” his position as a faculty member and that his conduct and pattern of behavior involving multiple students was a “breach of trust.” Farrar and Allen explained the board’s executive and governance committee decided on dismissal after receiving a recommendation from a three-member senate committee determining “there was adequate cause for his removal.” “That committee found Dr. Watter’s conduct to be unethical, inappropriate and in some instances exploitative,” the joint statement said. Story continues below advertisement “In engaging in sexual relations with a number of students, one of whom was in a vulnerable position and relying on him for support, the Hearing Committee found that Dr. Watter abused the responsibilities and authority of his position as a faculty member.” The email you need for the day's top news stories from Canada and around the world. Watter was charged by Hamilton police in June 2020 after a woman came forward with accusations of sexual assault and sexual assault causing bodily harm. The university would then reveal its own probe a month later after receiving more complaints and subsequent suspension of several faculty members, including Watter.

Watter, then-46-years-old, appeared in front of a justice in August 2021 and registered a not-guilty plea. The accuser, a former student never identified due to a publication ban, took the stand in the 2022 judge-only trial and insisted she was repeatedly assaulted without consent over several months in 2017. In December 2022, Justice Amanda Camara acquitted Watter saying the Crown failed to prove that he misused his position to persuade the student’s consent. She also rejected the accuser’s testimony saying inconsistencies in her story never proved there wasn’t consent to sexual activity. Story continues below advertisement McMaster’s executive and governance committee revealed that Watters did object to “the process and procedures” of their “removal proceedings” in mid-May. “The approach taken by the Hearing Committee was not procedurally fair, and resulted in a flawed conclusion based on a hearing that lacked the foundation of adequate particulars,” council for Watters said in a complaint. The hearing committee dismissed the submission insisting there was no proof of any “procedural error.” Related News McMaster University prof accused of sexual assault pleads ‘not guilty’",

        "content": "TORONTO — The University of Toronto turned to the courts Monday in an effort to clear an encampment of pro-Palestinian protesters from its downtown campus, as a Quebec judge imposed restrictions on a similar demonstration at the Université du Québec à Montréal. At the Toronto encampment, protesters said they were prepared to fight back with their own legal team and refused to leave the site, ignoring a deadline set in a trespass notice that had been issued last week. U of T president Meric Gertler said the school was seeking an injunction and asking a court for an expedited case conference. \"In addition to pursuing this legal avenue to return King’s College Circle to the university community, we continue to engage in discussions with students representing those in the encampment,\" he wrote in a statement early Monday. \"We held a long and productive meeting yesterday and are meeting again today. We remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement and bring the unauthorized encampment to an end.\" University officials had issued a trespass notice on Friday ordering demonstrators to remove the encampment by 8 a.m. Monday, and on Sunday officials indicated they would seek an injunction in court if protesters didn't comply. The protesters, who set up tents in a large green space at the heart of the university's downtown campus on May 2, were joined by faculty and labour groups for a rally outside the nearby Convocation Hall as the trespass deadline passed. Demonstrators held up flags and huddled under umbrellas as a drizzle turned to heavier rain during the rally. Sara Rasikh, one of the spokespeople for the encampment, told the crowd that protesters tried for months to get the university to listen to their demands, but only received acknowledgment after setting up the encampment. \"The reason for this is because the people's strength is threatening to them. It is threatening to the legitimacy of this institution,\" she said. \"U of T continues to propose committees but we want commitments. We want divestment. We want disclosure. And we want it now.\" On Sunday, Rasikh had said the group had its own team of lawyers prepared to respond to an application from the university for an injunction. \"The fact that (university administrators) want the police to come in and clear us out after they told us that they want to end things peacefully, it just doesn't make sense,\" she said. \"It does not change the fact that we will continue to remain steadfast in our demands.” Demonstrators and university administrators met Sunday afternoon, during which protesters presented what they described as a counter-offer calling on the school to disclose public investments in companies profiting from Israel's offensive in Gaza. They're also asking the school to establish and let them be part of a joint working group examining private investments, as well as cut ties with two specific Israeli academic institutions. On Thursday last week, the university had made an offer to the protesters – with 24 hours to respond – that said the school would form a working group to consider options for the disclosure of the school's investments, but it would not end any partnerships with Israeli universities. On divestment, the university said it would strike an advisory committee to review the students' request under existing school policies. Natalie Rothman, a history professor at the university and a member of the Jewish Faculty Network, said she was \"outraged\" when the school issued the trespass notice. \"This is a peaceful protest. We've been here from day one, it's been nothing but a model of what the university should be like in terms of real learning, real solidarity, real community,\" Rothman said at Monday's rally. \"And the fact that the university would threaten students and staff and faculty with disciplinary actions for a peaceful protest in accordance with our Charter rights, with the university's own mission statement, is absolutely outrageous.\" Ontario Minister of Colleges and Universities Jill Dunlop said Monday she supported clearing the encampment at the University of Toronto. \"We want to ensure this is cleaned up and dealt with right away,\" Dunlop said. \"Convocation is coming up and this is a safety issue. We want to ensure that families feel safe going on campus and not intimidated to attend the services.\" Other universities have also taken legal action to end pro-Palestinian protest encampments that have cropped up on their campuses. On Monday, a Quebec court granted the Université du Québec à Montréal a partial injunction against protesters who set up an encampment on its downtown campus earlier this month. Superior Court Justice Louis J. Gouin ruled safety measures need to be put in place at the site, including prohibiting protesters from setting up tents and other material within two metres of campus buildings and ensuring doors, windows and walls are clear of obstructions. The judge said the measures won't infringe on the encampment members' right to protest. Separately, two judges denied provisional injunction requests to dismantle an encampment set up in late April at McGill University. McGill is now seeking an interlocutory injunction, which focuses less on urgency and more on legal rights at the heart of the dispute. Meanwhile, protesters at McMaster University in Hamilton decided to put an end to their encampment after reaching a deal with the university last week. A statement issued by the group does not specify the terms of the agreement, but called it a \"significant step forward\" even though its demands were not all met.

        "content": "The newly elected President of the Real Estate Developers’ Association of Nigeria, Akintoye Adeoye, has promised to provide access to housing reports. He disclosed this at the association’s investiture ceremony in Lagos, recently. He said, “REDAN will provide members with exclusive access to market intelligence reports, data analytics, and research insights. “We will establish an accelerator and incubator programme to support real estate technology startups (prop-tech) and entrepreneurs in the built environment, offering mentoring, funding opportunities, and resources such as office space and legal support.” Adeoye assured that the association would establish governance in the real estate sector. He said, “REDAN will take a leadership role in creating regulatory frameworks and governance for the real estate industry. We will advocate for the recapitalisation of the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria to facilitate affordable housing. “Promoting ESG frameworks, sustainable practices, and regulatory compliance will position our members for long-term success. “We will focus on inclusivity, carbon emissions, energy consumption, waste management, water usage, and biodiversity conservation. Building capacity for green building practices will be a priority, offering resources, training, and incentives for adopting environmentally friendly construction methods and technologies.” Meanwhile, Prof. Fabian Ajogwu of Kenna Partners has called for transparency in the real estate sector. He said, “The critical issue stemming from challenges in the sector is a lack of transparency. The lack of transparency in land tenure systems, and land transactions makes it difficult in some states in Nigeria to ascertain a property’s true ownership and history, discouraging investment and weakening growth in the real estate sector. “Corruption also contributes to the lack of transparency in real estate transactions in Nigeria. It is a critical problem that runs through every level of the country’s government. This includes practices such as bribery, extortion, contract fraud, market distortion, which results in misallocation of resources, and embezzlement.”",

        "content": "The Ulsterman notched up his 25th win at the 2023 event , putting him one away from the all-time record of 26 set by his late uncle Joey Dunlop, which has stood since 2000 as the benchmark. He led the timesheets outright with a 129.59mph lap aboard his Hawk Racing-run Honda Superbike and headed Davey Todd, embarking on his first TT as a BMW rider following a switch from Padgetts Racing to TAS Racing for 2024. Outright lap record holder Peter Hickman completed the top three overall on his Superstock BMW run by FHO Racing. The opening day of practice had been delayed due to the 37.75-mile being hit by rain overnight, with roads not closing until 2pm for the untimed practices in the afternoon. The first timed qualifying of TT 2024 got underway at just after 6pm local time, with the first laps being set by the Supersport and Supertwin class. Todd led the way in the Supersport class after putting in two laps on his V2 Ducati Panigale, with his best effort a 125.601mph. That put him ahead of James Hillier, who has reunited with Bournemouth Kawasaki in the Supersport class, on a 125.483mph lap. Michael Dunlop completed the top three in class on his MD Racing-run Triumph 675. Dunlop, who won both Supersport races at TT 2023, switches from Honda machinery for 2024 for those contests. In Supertwin, Hickman led the way with a118.011mph lap aboard his Swan-liveried Yamaha R7, on which he was able to win at the North West 200 earlier this month having also won in class at the TT in 2023. He completed just one lap on his Supertwin and Triumph Supersport bike, with Todd second on his Dafabet Racing Kawasaki. Dunlop didn’t set a time on his Paton, and appeared to have some issues with it in the untimed session earlier in the day. Dunlop had no such issues on his Honda Fireblade in the Superbike class that concluded the solo running on Monday, with Todd and Hickman completing the top three. John McGuinness was fourth on the works Honda in class ahead of team-mate Dean Harrison. After apparent logistical and supply issues led to Harrison – who has switch to Honda from DAO Racing Kawasaki for 2024 – and McGuinness only having their Superstock bikes available at the North West 200, Honda has a full compliment of machinery at the TT. Hickman led the Superstock class at 129.032mph from Dunlop and Dominic Herbertson. The Sidecar class concluded Monday’s practice action, with the Ryan Crowe/Callum Crowe outfit leading the way with a best lap of 116.699mph. The headlines were stolen by outright Sidecar TT lap record holder and 14-time winner Ben Birchall, as he kicked off his 2024 TT campaign with a new passenger. Kevin Rousseau takes over from Ben’s brother Tom Birchall, who announced his retirement from the TT earlier this year . Birchall/Rousseau went second fastest on their second flying lap at 115.882mph, while Peter Founds and Jevan Walmsley completed the top three.",

        "content": "The New York Giants lost star running back Saquon Barkley in free agency this offseason after refusing to reach his asking price. They signed Devin Singletary as a response to fill the void in their backfield and give the lineup a capable starter at the position. However, Pro Football Focus does not seem as confident that the Giants’ new running back is a high-quality starter heading into the 2024 season. Devin Singletary lands at No. 30 in PFF’s running back rankings The Giants seem confident that Singletary can step into the lineup and replicate a fair amount of Barkley’s production this season as he leads a committee in their backfield. PFF’s Thomas Valentine, however, does not seem as confident: “Singletary was intended to be the backup for Dameon Pierce, but a fine run of performances, as well as disappointing ones from Pierce, saw the former Bills running back jump up the depth chart and not look back,” PFF’s Valentine wrote . “Singletary carried the ball a career-high 216 times for 898 yards and four touchdowns while earning a 70.8 grade. “His 23 explosive runs tied for 13th in the NFL, and he was top 20 in yards after contact, too. He ultimately will be the starting running back for the Giants in 2024.” Singletary is an explosive player who has found success in his NFL career. Playing in a lead role last season, he racked up 1,091 total yards from scrimmage — his third consecutive season topping 1,000 scrimmage yards. The Giants will get tremendous value out of Singletary’s contract Letting Barkley walk in free agency was a controversial decision for the Giants, but it was one made with financial logistics in mind. Rather than paying Barkley in excess of $12 million per season, they will be paying Singletary $5.5 million per season for three years. Coming in at a much cheaper price point, Singletary will prove to be a tremendous value signing for Big Blue. He averaged 2.88 yards after contact per attempt, with 36 missed tackles forced and 44 first downs in 2023. These numbers compare nicely to Barkley, who averaged, 2.91 yards after contact per attempt while forcing 31 missed tackles and securing 51 first downs. Singletary will lead the committee in the Giants’ backfield that features other young talents who have yet to reach their potential. This Giants running back room could be far better than expected in 2024, which should result in Singletary rising up the league’s rankings.

        "content": "Yunusa Tanko says Peter Obi will only work in a merger that makes Nigeria work and not one that is only interested in seeking power. There have been reports about a possible merger between Obi and other political leaders to wrestle power from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) just one year after he contested the 2023 presidential election which the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared Tinubu as the winner. While commenting on the matter, Tanko who is the Chief Spokesperson of Obi-Datti and Director of the Media, Labour Party (LP), said his principal is interested in seeing Nigeria work and thus will only partner with those who have similar values. “His Excellency, Peter Gregory is not interested in a merger that is only for the interest of seeking power. He is interested in a merger that will bring Nigerians out of the poverty level, bringing the Nigerian people to a comfortable state of health care,” he said on Monday’s edition of Channels Television’s Politics Today. “Making sure Nigerians have potable drinking water; making sure the problem of power supply is being solved. “So, therefore, he is interested strongly in a merger that is driven by ideology and a programme. But if it’s only for the purpose of power, he is not interested.” He said any merger between Obi and others will be subjected to scrutiny, ensuring values are in alignment. READ ALSO: [I Don’t See The Possibility]: Ex-Reps Member Rules Out Atiku, Obi Alliance Some weeks back, Obi and Atiku of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), met to discuss issues affecting the country. The meeting with the former vice president who was also the PDP presidential candidate in the 2023 election triggered claims of a merger between the duo. While Obi has also met other leaders and stakeholders across the country, a former House of Representatives member Tajudeen Yusuf does not see the former Anambra governor and Atiku forming a merger. “They have worked together before in 2019. It would not be out of place if they work together again. I am not in their minds but I don’t see the possibility,” he said. He cited Atiku’s comment about his willingness to continue contesting presidential elections. “They met a few days ago and after the meeting, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar came out to say he will continue to contest as long as he’s alive and healthy,” he said. “To me, that was to send a signal to those, especially the media, who were running with the notion that Alhaji Atiku Abubakar might step down and shelve his political ambition for Peter. But the follow-up statement a week later clarified that.” The former lawmaker thinks both men may contest the poll in 2027 which makes talks of a merger difficult.",

        "content": "Valeri Fridman, 60, of Dimona, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in Sderot on October 7. Valeri was one of 13 people taking part in an organized trip for older Israelis, mostly immigrants from the former Soviet Union, to the Dead Sea that morning, when their minibus got a flat tire near Sderot and stopped next to a bus stop in the city to try and fix it. While the group was standing there, rocket sirens rang out, and the bus stop bomb shelter — which was supposed to automatically open during a siren — remained electronically locked. Moments later, a pick-up truck of terrorists drove by and shot dead all 13 travelers. Only the driver emerged alive. Images of the group of pensioners lying dead at the bus stop were among the first to circulate on the morning of the Hamas onslaught, shocking Israelis and the world with the brutality of the assault. Valeri was buried in Dimona on October 12. He is survived by his three sons, Gadi, Alon and Steve, and two grandchildren. The Dimona municipality said he worked in a factory in Sderot. Family and friends remembered Valeri as a devoted fan of Maccabi Tel Aviv and a dedicated family man, who came to Israel 30 years ago from the former Soviet Union to establish a life in Israel. A family friend, Galit Glikin, eulogized Valeri on Facebook as “the person with the most golden heart. My father’s closest friend, and an uncle to us from a young age when I still lived in Dimona. A beloved man, with a huge heart.” Steve, Valeri’s son, visited the site where his father and so many others were gunned down, a month after the attack, and told Channel 12 news that the family “still haven’t accepted that this happened — we feel that Dad is coming home any minute.” Valeri’s son, Alon, told Ynet that his father was looking forward to the day trip to the Dead Sea, “to disconnect a little bit from work.” “Dad was probably the funniest person ever,” said Alon. “He got along with everyone and he had a big heart, we never saw him argue or fight with anyone, or say ‘no’ to anybody who asked him for anything. He was a special guy, he was always there for his grandchildren and for everyone.” Read more Those We Have Lost stories here.",

        "content": "Georgie Palmer reacts to being kicked off flight over daughter's nut allergy A BBC weather presenter whose family was kicked off a flight has said the ordeal was \"humiliating\". Georgie Palmer, 49, her husband Nick Sollom, 48, and daughters Rosie, 12, and Annie, 14, were ordered off the plane after they told the crew Rosie was allergic to peanuts. Staff on the flight from Gatwick Airport to Dalaman in Turkey refused to make an announcement to tell passengers not to eat peanuts, according to Ms Palmer. The forecaster said she gently asked fellow passengers sitting around her not to eat peanuts and to pass the message on. But Ms Palmer claimed the \"angry\" captain of the jet insisted they get off the plane before it would take off. She told Good Morning Britain the experience was \"absolutely humiliating\" for her daughter. Ms Palmer added: \"When he (the captain) found out I had spoken to the other passengers he was screaming at me from the cockpit. He was so angry.

It is really beautiful how every passenger on that plane was so wonderful, but nobody working on that plane showed one ounce of compassion.\" Ms Palmer added: \"Rosie is in a terrible state about this. It has ruined her holiday. We don't go away all the time. We maybe fly once a year and have never had problems with other airlines. \"If we had known that policy, we would never have booked with them. We have been through the website with a fine-tooth comb and there is nothing.\" She said there was no way to inform the airline beforehand and wondered how many people with peanut allergies would fly on SunExpress this summer not knowing the policy.

Read our Privacy Policy Ms Palmer said even if her daughter didn't come into direct contact with a peanut, if someone ate one on board, then she could die. The presenter said three days after what happened the family still hadn't heard from SunExpress and the family's insurance says the captain has the discretion to remove people for no reason. A spokesman for SunExpress said: \"We take the safety of our passengers very seriously. Shortly after boarding our flight from London Gatwick, the passenger raised a concern about one of his family group having a serious peanut allergy and requested an announcement to other passengers. \"We refrain from making these kinds of announcements as, like many other airlines, we cannot guarantee an allergen-free environment on our flights, nor prevent other passengers from bringing food items containing allergens on board.\" The spokesman said due to the \"insistent behaviour\" of the passenger to others on board that they should not consume nuts, the captain decided it would be safest if the family did not travel on the flight. Trending The family was told to get off the plane at London Gatwick (Image: Getty) He added: \"When this was explained to the passenger, he did exhibit aggressive behaviour towards our crew members and tried to gain access to the cockpit. \"To ensure the safety of our crew and our passengers on board, we cannot tolerate aggressive and unruly behaviour on our flights. \"Additionally, our website states passengers must notify us 48 hours in advance of any special care required due to a medical condition and no such notification was received from the passengers in this instance.\" The spokesman said the airline is fully aware this was an upsetting situation for the family and is taking the incident as an opportunity to conduct a review of the information provided during the booking process to ensure \"more effective solutions\" for passengers with allergies. Mr Sollom denied behaving aggressively, but admitted to feeling irked by the decision. He said he knocked on the cockpit door in a bid to speak to the captain after being told the family's bags were being removed from the plane.

        "content": "A US soldier detained in Russia has been accused by state prosecutor's of threatening to kill his girlfriend. Staff Sergeant Gordon D. Black was originally arrested close to the Russia - North Korea border on May 2 on suspicion of theft, but the charges against him have been toughened. Black, 34, had followed Alexandra Vaschuk - also known as Aleksa Viktorovna, 31 - from South Korea, where he was posted by the US army, to her home city Vladivostok, a Russian Pacific naval port. According to the indictment, Black “grabbed the woman by the neck” during a quarrel. The Primorsky region prosecution service said: “He is charged with a threat of murder with grounds to fear the threat might be fulfilled, and a theft inflicting considerable damage.\" State news agency Interfax reported: “The woman said she took his actions as a threat to her life. “After that, Black, who had no money of his own, stole 10,000 rubles [£88] from the woman's wallet and spent it on his needs, including a hotel room where he was found and detained.” Earlier reports specified he had stolen a much higher amount - 200,000 rubles (£1,765) plus alcohol. Black was taken into detention earlier this month and has been ordered to remain in a pre-trial detention until a new custody hearing in early July. The charges he faces both carry sentences of up to two years. The threat to kill charge under certain circumstances may carry a maximum five year sentence. There is evidence the US serviceman was planning to leave Vladivostok when he was detained as he had reportedly bought a flight ticket. The Russian woman - who has been pictured with a gun - is known to have lived in South Korea previously, and this appears to be where they met and started a “romantic relationship”. Pictures showed them enjoying meals out together in January and earlier. Russian reports earlier stated that two weeks after coming to Vladivostok the US army staff sergeant - who is reported to be married - “beat his beloved and stole 200,000 roubles from her”. Russian foreign ministry officials earlier said the case is \"not related to politics or espionage”. It is believed Black underwent lengthy questioning from the Russian authorities when he arrived in the country, but was then allowed to enter. There are reports in Russia that the pair had known each other for several years. A US army spokeswoman said following his detention: \"The Army notified his family and the U.S. Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the soldier in Russia.” The soldier, from Red Bud, Illinois had been expected back in Texas for a new posting. Black's mother, Melody Jones, told the US media her son had gone to Russia to visit his girlfriend. The Russian Interior Ministry said today that the woman had met Black in Korea where she worked and that they were “in a relationship”. “On 10 April, the man came to the acquaintance's house in the Far Eastern capital,” said the statement. “Later, the applicant had a conflict with the acquaintance at home. “After he left, the woman discovered that the money was missing and turned to the police for help. “Police officers found the suspect in one of the city hotels. He had purchased air tickets and intended to fly home.” The arrest comes amid suspicions that Russia is seeking to hold US citizens to be used as bargaining chips to secure the release of Russians convicted abroad. Falsely jailed Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich , 32, has remained in pre-trial detention for over 26 months of bogus charges of espionage. Russian officials have not yet provided any evidence to back up their baseless allegations. Paul Whelan, 54, a former US Marine, is also classified as wrongfully detained in Russia by Washington. At least two American citizens arrested in Russia in recent years, including basketball star Brittney Griner, have been exchanged for Russians jailed in the US.

        "content": "New Delhi, May 27: An international team of scientists from Finland, Canada, the US, and New Zealand has discovered a specific brain network hub that plays a key role in stuttering, an advance that can lead to new treatment options. The research, published in the Brain journal, examines two different types of stuttering — developmental and acquired. While both types are traditionally known to be separate, the study showed that besides “similarities at the behavioural level, there are also similarities at the neural level”. “Stuttering affects approximately 1 per cent of adults and can result in significant communication problems and social anxiety, yet the cause of stuttering is still unknown,” said lead author Catherine Theys, Associate Professor at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand. The professor said that while stuttering is a developmental disorder, it can also be caused by focal brain damage after a stroke or other neurological conditions. For the study, the team used two datasets and lesion network mapping to test whether lesions causing acquired stuttering map to a common brain network. They also used a third dataset to test whether this lesion-based network was relevant to developmental stuttering. Analysing each dataset, the team located a common stuttering network — a specific part of the left putamen, which is responsible for lip and face movements and timing and sequencing of speech. They also identified two additional areas of interest for speech imaging and stuttering research — the claustrum and amygdalostriatal transition area. “These are tiny areas of the brain — only a few mm wide — which is why they may typically not have been identified in previous studies. This shows a plausible network for stuttering,” they said, adding that the findings have relevance for treatment.",
