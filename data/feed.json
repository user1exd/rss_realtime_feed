Image: Facebook/FAMAS Piolo Pascual confessed that he was drunk in his acceptance speech for Best Actor at the Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences Awards (FAMAS) awards although he managed to make it through his speech. A laughing Pascual revealed this upon accepting his Best Actor trophy for his performance in the film “Mallari” at the star-studded event last Sunday, May 25, as seen in a video recorded by one @trixie_dauz on X (formerly Twitter). “Napakabigat,” he began while referring to his trophy. “Maraming, maraming salamat po sa FAMAS. Unang-una, nais kong pasalamatan ang Panginoong Diyos sa karangalang ito because kung wala po ang Panginoong Diyos, wala po ako dito.” “And of course, my parents — Mommy Vi, Dad Bo,” he said, referring to his onscreen “parents,” Vilma Santos and Christopher de Leon, who starred with him in the film “Dekada ’70.” “They are my parents, they reared me in this business.” (The trophy is so heavy! Thank you very much to FAMAS. First of all, I want to thank the Lord for this award because if He wasn’t here, I wouldn’t be here either. And of course, my parents, Mommy Vi, and Dad Bo, they are my parents, they reared me in this business.) READ: Kathryn Bernardo, Piolo Pascual, Alfred Vargas lead FAMAS 2024 winners The actor then said he wanted to thank more people before admitting that he “drank a lot” at the event. However, he managed to thank the production team behind the film including director Derrick Cabrido and Mentorque Productions owner Bryan Diamante. “Marami po akong papasalamatan pero marami na rin po ako nainom tonight,” he said while laughing. Pascual then asked Diamante to go onstage while crediting the staff behind “Mallari.” “Sabi niya sa’kin I just want to make the best film of the year. And we won Best Picture. Gusto ko magpasalamat sa lahat ng bumubuo ng pelikulang ‘to. Marami pa akong gustong pasalamatan.” (I want to thank more people but I drank a lot tonight. Bryan Diamante told me he wanted to make the best film of the year. And we won Best Picture. I want to thank everyone behind the film. I want to thank more people.) A laughing Santos — who was standing at the side of the stage with de Leon — teased the drunk Pascual, saying, “Lasing ka na, anak. Lasing ka na, anak. Go ahead, anak. Go!” The actor said in response: “Pwede ba ako mag-shades (Can I wear shades), Mom?” Piolo Pascual LASING sa Best Actor Speech #72ndfamasawards #piolopascual pic.twitter.com/QVUoMxeV2b — N01 #Seoulmeyt (@trixie_dauz) May 26, 2024 Pascual eventually managed to pull himself together, as he praised the hard work of his co-actors and staff in the film. “Gusto kong magpasalamat sa bumubuo ng ‘Mallari.’ Sa direktor ko, si Direk Derrick [Cabrido], sa [producer] ko, sa camera. Lahat po ng bumubuo ng ‘Mallari.’” “Pinaghirapan po namin ‘yung pelikulang ito at lahat po ng artista, pinaghirapan po nila ‘yung trabaho nila,” he continued. “So, maraming maraming salamat po. Hindi ko po ipagkakait sa sarili ko kasi para sa pelikulang Pilipino ito. Maraming salamat. God bless you.” (I want to thank the people who made “Mallari” possible — director Derrick Cabrido, the producer, and the camera men. To everyone behind the film. We all worked hard on this film. And to my co-actors, they worked so hard. So thank you very much. I will never stop myself from doing this because this is for Philippine cinema. Thank you very much. God bless you.)

        "content": "Senator Joel Villanueva, a devout Christian and proud son of an evangelist, warns of the possible emergence of a “drive-thru” or express dissolution of marriage in the Philippines via the proposed divorce law. INQUIRER.net stock photo MANILA, Philippines — Senator Joel Villanueva, a devout Christian and proud son of an evangelist, warned of the possible emergence of a “drive-thru” or express dissolution of marriage in the Philippines. He raised the alarm as congressional debates and decisions on the Absolute Divorce Bill loom. “How can this affect our Filipino families? Baka ho magkaroon ng drive-thru. Lahat ng kanto dito sa Pilipinas. At ‘pag ang mag-asawa ay nagaway — ayaw lang ng bangs, ayaw lang ng shampoo, ayaw lang ng niluto ni misis — magaaway at maghihiwalay. Eh baka ho hindi tayo ready doon,” Villanueva told reporters in an ambush interview on Tuesday. (How can this affect our Filipino families? Maybe there will be a drive-thru. In every street in the Philippines. And whenever a married couple argues — just because of undesirable bangs, shampoo, or meals cooked by the wife — a fight will happen and then they’ll divorce. Maybe we are not ready for that.) READ: How House members voted on divorce bill The House of Representatives, before adjourning its second regular session on May 22, approved the contentious divorce bill. The lower chamber initially reported that 126 lawmakers voted in favor of the proposed divorce law and that 109 House members voted against while 20 members abstained from voting. “Ginagalang namin ang posisyon ng House despite the fact na napaka-questionable ng nangyaring botohan. But it’s on their turf at hindi namin pakikialaman po ‘yun,” Villanueva said. ( We respect the position of the House despite the fact that the voting that happened is very questionable. But it’s on their turf and we won’t interfere with that .) Instead, the senator asked their counterparts in the lower chamber to respect the Senate’s time to study the proposed divorce law. READ: Estrada’s survey shows tight tally on divorce bill at Senate Still, Villanueva stressed he could not see how the divorce bill would help poor Filipinos. “Parang sinasabi pa rin na kagaya ng annulment, ito ay para sa mayayaman pa rin,” he said. (It’s like saying that similar to annulment, it’s still for the rich.) “Kami po sa Senado ay willing i-scrutinize at pag-aralang mabuti kung ano ang magiging epekto nito, ano ang magiging epekto sa Family Code, anong magiging epekto nito sa bawat pamilyang Pilipino — na tayo majority ay Kristiyano,” he emphasized. (We in the Senate are willing to scrutinize and study carefully what will be the effect of this, what will be the effect on the Family Code, what will be the effect on every Filipino family — that we are mostly Christians.) To support his argument, Villanueva said majority of Filipinos believe in the holy sacrament of marriage. He even quoted the Book of Malachi in the Bible, pointing out that God made a categorical statement against divorce. “So, kung ang Diyos mo sinasabi na: ‘I hate divorce,’ ‘yung Diyos mo na author ng Word of God na sinasabi ng Constitution doon sa preamble — “that we the sovereign Filipino people, imploring the aid of almighty God,” – who is this God that we are referring to? Is this the same God who said I hate divorce and now we are passing a measure that would promote divorce?,” he asked. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

The framework, called Metro Manila Road Safety Action Plan (MMRSAP) 2024-2028, was formed after a three-day stakeholders’ meeting which was part of the celebration of Philippine Road Safety Month, the MMDA said in a statement on Tuesday. READ: DOH: 12,000 killed on roads each year It is also a component of Project 6: Traffic Safety and Education under the 5-Year Action Plan of the Comprehensive Traffic Management Plan for Metro Manila, funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency. According to the agency’s Metro Manila Accident Reporting and Analysis System (MMARAS), there were about 92,583 road crashes recorded annually from 2013 to 2022, with an average of 410 deaths each year. Fifty-one percent of these fatalities were drivers, 36 percent were pedestrians, and 13 percent were passengers. This prompted the MMDA and other various agencies to establish the MMRSAP 2024-2028, which focuses on the five pillars of road safety: road safety management, safer roads, safer vehicles, safer road users, and post-crash response. READ: Higher jaywalking fines overlook sensible road safety steps “Inspired by our discussions and dialogue, we are poised to forge ahead in crafting a comprehensive action plan that will pave the way for safer and more efficient road systems in Metro Manila. Together, we have the power to effect positive change and create a safer environment for motorists, pedestrians, and commuters alike,” said MMDA Assistant General Manager for Planning OIC Atty. Victor Pablo Trinidad in his speech, as quoted in the statement. Meanwhile, World Health Organization Representative to the Philippines Dr. Rui Paulo de Jesus stressed that road safety is a shared responsibility that requires multisectoral actions from concerned agencies. “The Road Safety Action Plan for Metro Manila 2024-2028 that is being developed will provide a blueprint for evidence-based interventions to save lives and prevent serious injuries from road crashes in Metro Manila,” he said. Also present at the meeting were representatives from Metro Manila’s local government units, the Department of Public Works and Highways, the Department of Health, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, the Land Transportation Office, the Philippine National Police-National Capital Region Police Office, the Philippine National Police-Highway Patrol Group, and the University of the Philippines-National Center for Transportation Studies.

        "content": "In this file photo, a patient undergoes dialysis at a clinic. (AP) MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) is studying a proposal to increase its dialysis package to P5,200 per session so that medications needed for the procedure will also be covered. Eli Dino Santos, PhilHealth executive vice president, said in an interview on Tuesday after meeting with ACT-CIS party-list Rep. Erwin Tulfo that they will study the increase in per session coverage—currently at P2,600. Santos said this after Tulfo noted that hemodialysis medicines used for the procedure cost around P900 to P1,500 per vial. “So now, through the efforts of our Cong. Erwin Tulfo, PhilHealth, will study the increase (of the coverage) to P5,200. We will study this and we are given one month to study this. And then, we can cover all medicines. That’s our goal, and that’s the directive of Cong. Erwin Tulfo,” Santos told reporters at a briefing at the Batasang Pambansa complex. “Our goal is that our dialysis patients will no longer make out of pocket [...] With the specifics to the medicine, I have no data about that, but what they usually buy is erythropoietin, which patients usually buy outside of a (hemodialysis) facility. This is what usually adds up to the expense of patients,” he added. Tulfo explained that the P2,600 package supposedly includes the medicines, but these are only provided in government hospitals, which means patients have to buy these vials first before getting a hemodialysis treatment. “Little did we know that it is included in the package of PhilHealth worth P2,600, it is included there but there are hospitals, facilities, and dialysis centers without these medicines. So what will happen now is that PhilHealth will be given one month to study it, as per the instruction of the Speaker (Ferdinand Martin Romualdez),” Tulfo said. “We brought this up because there are diabetes patients who told the Office of the Speaker that they are having problems with buying medicines, that’s why they have approached congressmen, mayors, senators. So to solve this problem what PhilHealth will do is to double the P2,600 package for dialysis, it is now P5,200 so that it will be all-in,” he added. Santos meanwhile assured that PhilHealth has enough funds for a possible higher benefit provision, with total assets — excluding obligations like outstanding payments to hospitals — amounting to P589.5 billion. This includes a P463.7 billion reserve fund. Last June 2023, PhilHealth increased its hemodialysis coverage from 144 sessions to 156 sessions — or twelve more additional sessions.

        "content": "PASTOR APOLLO QUIBOLOY (INQUIRER FILE PHOTO / GRIG C. MONTEGRANDE) MANILA, Philippines — The personal assistant of embattled Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KJC) founder Apollo Quiboloy surrendered 21 firearms in Davao City, according to the Philippine National Police. The PNP said 21 firearms belonging to Cresente Chavez Canada, also the Barangay Tamayong captain, were surrendered through a lawyer at KOJC Compound along the Phil-Japan Friendship Highway in Barangay Sasa at about 6:30 a.m. on Saturday. In April, Canada surrendered to authorities but later posted bail. He was charged with violation of Republic Act 7610 or the Anti-Child Abuse Law, specifically the provision on sexual abuse of minors and maltreatment. All surrendered firearms, many of which are high-powered, are now in the custody of Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) in Davao City for proper documentation and disposition. The PNP said CIDG Director Police Major General Leo Francisco “expressed gratitude to KOJC for their support and stressed the importance of voluntary surrenders in maintaining peace.” These guns are on top of the initial five firearms which were surrendered by Quiboloy’s camp following the order canceling his license to own and possess firearms (LTOPF) from PNP chief General Rommel Marbil. The Firearms and Explosives Office of the PNP released its recommendation to revoke the LTOPF of the self-proclaimed “appointed son of god” after Senator Risa Hontiveros insisted that the religious leader is “armed and dangerous.” Two separately-issued arrest orders for Quiboloy are in effect for sexual abuse and human trafficking charges. Apart from these cases, a warrant of arrest issued by the Senate panel on women headed by Hontiveros had also been released. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

        "content": "Garmin is pushing out a new software update that will help you find a missing phone, no matter how far away you dropped it, or put it down. Software version 19.18 is rolling out now to Garmin Forerunner 965 owners, and will hopefully be coming to even more devices in the near future. If you own a , you're probably already familiar with the basic Find My Phone feature, which helps you track down a missing handset that's relatively nearby. Provided your phone is within Bluetooth range, it will guide you towards it by indicating whether you're getting hotter or colder (moving closer or further away) and making the phone emit a loud chime. It works brilliantly if your phone is only a few meters away, but it's not going to help if your handset fell out of your pocket while you were having lunch, or you left it in the changing room at the gym. The new feature works differently, working out the last point at which your watch had a Bluetooth connection to your smartphone and plotting a route back to that point. Once there, you should (hopefully) be able to reconnect, and use the other Find My Phone tool to find exactly where it is. Unlike something like a Tile tracker or Apple AirTag, it won't let you see your phone's location if it's been moved or stolen, but provided the handset is where you left it, you should be quickly reunited. As Alex Alderson of explains, software version 19.18 also adds a bundle of other features and fixes, such as pin drop navigation (which lets you send and share locations from Apple Maps) and the ability to switch dynamically between your watch's heart rate sensor and a chest strap , depending on which is providing the most stable signal. The update also solves a problem that meant jump rope activities would sometimes fail to upload correctly, and one where activity profiles would sometimes appear in a different order on your watch face, and on the Garmin Connect mobile app. For a complete list of changes, . The software should be rolled out to your watch automatically via Garmin Connect, but you can also activate the update manually by pressing the Menu button then selecting System > Software Update > Check For Updates.",

The 53-year-old shared a wholesome video on Instagram showing the pair preparing for the big day. Amanda and Hollie were seen doing their hair and makeup together, before donning cute matching floral dresses. One fan commented: \"Like mum, like daughter.\" Whilst another added: \"You both look so pretty and I love both of your dresses.\" \"You all looked gorgeous,\" commented a third. Amanda recently admitted that she feared for her job on Britain's Got Talent after her daughter Hollie stormed the panel. On Sunday's episode, 12-year-old Hollie was joined by Simon Cowell's son Eric, 10, as they jumped up onto the panel and slammed the golden buzzer button. Amanda looked visibly horrified when Hollie and Eric appeared and sent Japanese double dutch dancers Haribow through to the live BGT semi-finals. Sharing the clip on Instagram, Amanda later wrote: \"I mean ... I thought I was going to get fired as it was so unexpected my #HRH & Eric x even @simoncowell was wobbled but they have the first ever audience GOLDEN BUZZER\" Amanda recently got into a heated feud with Osborne after calling the Celebrity Big Brother star \"bitter and pathetic.\" Sharon responded to Amanda, saying, \"You’ll never be in my league.\" This exchange followed Sharon, 71, and her best friend Louis Walsh , also 71, frequently gossiping about Simon during their time in the West London compound.",

        "content": "Enugu State Governor Peter Mbah has inaugurated the 8th Council of the Enugu State Traditional Rulers Council, charging the royal fathers to be in charge of the security of their communities through partnership with the government across all levels. The chairman of the council, Igwe Samuel Asadu, who is the traditional ruler of Edem-Ani Autonomous Community in Nsukka local government area, said they would key into the administration’s vision, mobilise against insecurity and ensure the success of the government. Mbah, who inaugurated the council yesterday at the House of Chiefs Chamber of the Enugu State House of Assembly Complex, Enugu, said the functions of the traditional institution go beyond being custodians of culture and tradition to fostering peace and unity as well as serving as the eyes and ears of the government. “We are also taking this opportunity to remind ourselves that beyond being the custodians of our tradition and culture, you are also the ears and eyes of the government in your various communities so that when we talk about security challenges we are having in communities, we expect to work with you in partnership to address those security challenges,” he said. The governor further enjoined the royal fathers to work closely with the government and their subjects, serving as agents of positive change in the communication process in a way that their subjects would understand and appreciate the policies and programmes of the government on education, infrastructure, healthcare, security, and their general wellbeing. Highlighting some of the impactful projects the administration was executing across communities in the state, Governor Mbah explained that the government was taking deliberate steps to ensure that no child of learning age is denied quality education through the 260 smart green schools across the 260 electoral wards, adding that education, training of youths on skills acquisition and human capacity building that the state had already embarked were serving as the greatest weapons against insecurity. He said the robust programmes of the administration would be difficult to accomplish if traditional rulers continue to live outside their communities since they are the eyes and ears of the government who have roles to play in community development. While congratulating the new council, the State Commissioner for Chieftaincy Matters, Hon. Okey Ogbodo explained that the process leading to the selection of the council was based on fidelity, integrity and commitment to the robust development programmes of the government to the people, saying the criteria was in line with section 3(1) of the state traditional rulers’ law. Reacting, Igwe Asad pledged not to disappoint the state as they would continue to ensure the success of the administration. Igwe Asadu, who described the governor as an agent of positive change whose landmark achievements cut across communities, said the first state-financed project in the history of their community was instituted by the Mbah administration.",

        "description": "Karen Zulu and her friend — who is reportedly dating the Gauteng MEC for Human Settlements — had the time of their lives in Paris and Monaco.",
        "content": "Helicopter rides, shopping sprees, wining, dining and five-star hotels — this is the life of Karen Zulu, the partner of controversial businessman Edwin Sodi. FROM PARIS WITH LOVE Earlier this month, Zulu – who is a social media influencer – jetted off to France in Europe. According to entertainment commentator Sanele Nkosi , Zulu went on holiday with her friend, Anelisa Ntlakana, who is allegedly the partner of Gauteng’s MEC for Human Settlements, Urban Planning and Infrastructure Development — Lebohang Maile. On her TikTok account, Zulu shared snippets of her European trip with her friend, giving her followers a glimpse into their opulent lifestyles. In one video, the two ladies can be seen strutting their stuff as they board a helicopter by Monacair (a helicopter company based at the Monaco Heliport in Monaco, France). In another, Zulu is seen drinking wine and “toasting to the good life” from across an illuminated Eiffel Tower. DID KAREN ZULU AND EDWIN SODI BREAK UP? In February this year, Sunday World reported that Zulu and Sodi were not seeing eye-to-eye amid investigations on the entrepreneur’s businesses and the auctioning of his assets. According to a source, the 50-year-old Blackhead Consulting boss had urged Zulu not to flaunt her lavish lifestyle on social media, but she allegedly did not listen. The source further alleged that Sodi took back the gifts he had bought for Zulu, including the designer bags she often shows off on Instagram. In addition, Zulu (whose Instagram account is private) deleted all the images she posted of her and Sodi or inside his house. These include photographs of Sodi’s lavish 50th birthday party which was hosted at his Morningside mansion in September 2023. 90 VEHICLES TO BE SEIZED? In the same month, it was reported that the corruption-accused businessman is at risk of losing over 90 vehicles following a court order by a giant insurance company, Hollard. As per the court papers, Hollard acted as a guarantor for Sodi’s company, NJR Projects, to receive millions from the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA). The bank is reported to have given the company over R39 million as an advance payment. This came after NJR was awarded a R282 million tender by the Department of Public Works to upgrade and build accommodation for a correctional centre in Parys, Free State. The project was reportedly supposed to have been completed by 20 February 2022. However, the contract was allegedly terminated because the company failed to “achieve practical completion” of the project on time. Following NJR’s alleged failure to repay the loan, Hollard sought an order for the sheriff to seize the company’s movable assets. These include five Bell TLBs, a BMW X3, two Chevrolet Utility vehicles, a Ford Fiesta, 41 Ford Rangers and 10 Hino trucks. In addition, there are 15 Mazda CX3s, 4 Mercedes-Benz vehicles, 6 Nissan NP200s, three tankers, three Toyota bakkies and eight VW vehicles.",

In this regard, China News Network talked with Doug Guthrie, Director of China Initiatives at Thunderbird School of Global Management. Guthrie noted that China's economy is much better organized than most capitalist market economies around the world right now. The Chinese government is an extremely decentralized and entrepreneurial system of district and township governments. When global economic headwinds crest their horizon, China has the buttons to push to meet projected rates of growth.",

        "content": "Brazil has overtaken Belgium as the largest overseas destination for China-made new energy vehicles, according to the China Passenger Car Association. Data from the CPCA shows that China's exports of pure electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids to Brazil soared 13-fold year-on-year to 40,163 units in April, ranking first for a second straight month. The rise in NEV exports also made Brazil China's second-largest destination for all cars in April, with Russia retaining its top spot, according to the CPCA. Carmakers in China have been exploring South America, Australia and ASEAN markets for exports, as the European Union is conducting an anti-subsidy probe into Chinese EV makers and threatening to raise tariffs on their EVs, said Cui Dongshu. Spain, France, the Netherlands and Norway were among the countries that saw biggest falls in imports of China-made electric passenger vehicles from January to April, according to CPCA data. Brazil is slated to raise tariffs on EV imports as it seeks to encourage local production. Import taxes for electric vehicles had been reduced to zero since 2015 before they became subject to a 10 percent tax since January. The taxes will increase to 18 percent in July and eventually reach 35 percent in July 2026. Several Chinese automakers have already started increasing investments for local production in Brazil. BYD has started building a manufacturing complex there to begin local production by year-end or in early 2025 and Great Wall Motor has said that its Brazil plant would begin operations this month.",

        "content": "China's first domestically developed and the world's largest electric container vessel received two design and building contracts, Shanghai's Pudong New Area regional government said. It marked a milestone of China's progress toward achieving \"dual carbon\" goals in the maritime shipping sector. The electric vessel is driven by two permanent magnet propulsion motors with a capacity of 875 kilowatts, and a maximum speed of 11.5 knots. A total of ten box battery cells with total capacity of about 19,000 kilowatt-hours provide power for two motors. The electric vessel has a length of 127.8 meters and a width of 21.6 meters. It can load 740 standard containers - twenty-foot equivalent units - with total capacity of over 9,000 tons. Its unique design reduces time for freight upload and unload. The electric vessel is designed by Shanghai Merchant Ship Design & Research Institute under the China State Shipbuilding Corporation. The contract was made with Ningbo Ocean Shipping Co, with the two vessels to be built by Jiangxi Jiangxin Shipbuilding Co. The signing of the contract is being viewed as a positive sign that shipping along China's coastal regions will enter an era of zero emissions and electrification, the report noted. Guided by country's goals of achieving \"carbon emissions peak\" and \"carbon neutrality,\" China's shipping industry has ramped up green transition by deploying more new-energy vessels. A 10,000-ton-level electric container vessel developed and built by China COSCO Shipping Corporation was delivered in last December. The operation of the vessel can reduce CO2 emissions by 2,918 tons annually, equivalent for planting 160,000 trees, according to media reports. China's first hydrogen battery-powered vessel was deployed in Yichang, Central China's Hubei Province, which can save 103.16 tons of gasoline, and reduce 343.67 tons of CO2 emissions each year.",

        "content": "China's top market regulator has pledged to apply more technologies into law enforcement to increase crackdowns on counterfeits and unqualified goods in cyberspace, so that intellectual property rights can be strongly protected. The pledge was made by Tong Bo, an official from the State Administration for Market Regulation, on Tuesday while introducing its achievements against IP violations. She said that the administration has planned to take advantage of big data, cloud computing and mobile network in law enforcement, \"aiming to improve our capability of finding and identifying IP violations.\" According to her, a crackdown on fighting online IP infringements was jointly launched by the administration and several other authorities, including the Ministry of Public Security and the China National Intellectual Property Administration, in June last year. \"The aim of the crackdown was to urge internet platforms to perform their duties, as well as to regulate the market order in cyberspace and purify the online business environment,\" she said. She cited data as revealing that during the crackdown, market regulators at all levels dealt with 27,000 online cases involving IP infringement, of which, 267 were transferred to public security bureaus to further investigate. The market regulators nationwide also removed about 160,000 pieces of information regarding counterfeit goods, with the shutdown of 1,374 websites, she said. In addition, 7,390 online shops were required to stop their platform services after being found to have problems, she added. \"Similar actions are carrying on,\" she said, releasing that the top market regulator has continued, since March, to jointly strengthen IP protection online and severely combat counterfeits in cyberspace.",

        "content": "China has stepped up efforts to strengthen intellectual property protection through quicker channels to ensure the legitimate rights and interests of innovators are strongly and widely supported and protected, a spokeswoman of the country's top IP regulator said on Tuesday. Guo Wen, the head of the China National Intellectual Property Administration's IP protection division, told a news conference that a total of 71 national-level IP protection centers have been set up nationwide, with the establishment of 41 stations to help innovators quickly solve IP disputes. Such IP protection centers have been basically covered in the country's major and developed cities, while the stations have been expanded in clusters where small commodities or fast-moving consumer goods are frequently seen, according to her. She cited data, noting that the centers and stations accepted 35,000 cases from January to April and that the average processing time was around two weeks. \"In this way, IP rights owners can be protected in a timely and convenient manner,\" she said. In the first four months, the institutes also received 85,000 patent per-review requests, and the authorization period for invention patents approved through this per-examination was kept within three months, she said. In addition, more than 150,000 government agencies and enterprises have been registered at the institutes in order to obtain quicker and more optimized IP services. She added. These institutes have played a bigger role in serving innovators by issuing 833 patent analysis reports and offering 2,142 times as much free IP training in 2023, she said. While the IP services are being facilitated, China's judicial protection of IP rights has also been enhanced. By the end of last year, 25 high people's courts, 242 intermediate courts, and 287 grassroots-level courts had been able to consolidate IP civil, administrative and criminal cases into a single adjudication tribunal for tackling, said Ding Guangyu, an official from the Supreme People's Court. \"Thanks to the 'three-in-one' platform, the quality and efficiency of IP case handling have been constantly improved,\" said the deputy chief judge of the SPC's No. 3 Civil Adjudication Tribunal. To punish harshly those who seriously infringe upon others' IP rights, punitive damages will be applied in 319 IP cases in 2023, an increase of 117 percent compared with 2022, he added.",

She revealed that Cambodia will launch a national pavilion on Alibaba.com in September on the sidelines of the 21st China-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Expo in Nanning, south China’s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. In her speech at a seminar on \"Beyond borders: bringing Cambodian products to the global market through Alibaba.com”, Nimul emphasized the enormous potential of China’s e-commerce platform, pointing out that it will provide Cambodian businesses significant opportunities to showcase their products to wide range of international buyers and increase their exports. Currently, several Cambodian specialty products, such as pepper and edible bird's nests, have been put up for sale. A representative from Alibaba attending the meeting stated that the platform will open the door to the global market for Cambodian SMEs and entrepreneurs. In October 2023, the Cambodian Ministry of Commerce signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Alibaba to sell local products to China and global markets through the eWTP platform, aiming to rapidly develop the country's e-commerce industry.",

        "content": "Consumers try wireless mobile phone charging by riding spin bikes to generate electricity at the McDonald's zero carbon restaurant in Shougang Park in Beijing. (Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn) As we see a surging demand and a favorable business environment, industry experts said that China's young-generation consumers are expected to become a new driving force of the development of ESG (environmental, social and governance), further promoting the sustainable growth in the field. They said that in the recent two to three years, ESG has transformed from not only an operation goal for business entities, but a trendy lifestyle, or mindset, among consumers. Consumers bring their own mugs or bottles when buying coffee. LEED cafes and restaurants are becoming increasingly popular among the youth, as they pay special attention to the LEED marks on the store's window before entering them. The LEED rating system, devised by the United States Green Building Council, assesses the degree to which a building is environmentally friendly, utilizes energy-efficient equipment, and actively adopts renewable energies or other technologies that reduce the negative impacts of buildings on the environment. \"For many young people, ESG is no longer an unattainable concept but a practical and achievable one. More and more young people are choosing to purchase, use, and promote products with environmental elements and are adopting green, low-carbon lifestyles. This trend is particularly evident in sectors such as food and beverages, household goods, and fashion,\" said Wang Jing, vice-president of USGBC North Asia. \"I have stuck to the habit of bringing my coffee mug ever since 2015. As a coffee lover, I bought my first coffee container. It is very convenient ...... During my lunch break, I go to the coffee shop near the company, order a cup of coffee, and take it away with my own mug. I have kept the habit until now,\" said Mo Cha, a 30-year-old white collar in Shanghai. \"Leading a low-carbon, or environmentally-friendly life is kind of cool,\" Mo added. Wang, as an observer in ESG for over a decade, said that people began to realize the importance of ESG, and they are willing to learn more about the field. The demand for ESG-related talent is strong and continues to grow. However, the supply of matching talent is somewhat insufficient as ESG only become mainstream in the past few years. In the past years, the demand for experienced and skilled professionals within ESG has reached an all-time high, no matter in China, the United States or European countries. The demand is vastly exceeding the existing number of experienced and qualified professionals available in the booming field, said Wang Bing, committee member and deputy secretary general of the Energy Industry Brand Research and Development Branch of China Energy Research Society. Witnessing the skyrocketing demand for ESG education in the country, global consultancies, including KPMG, Deloitte, EY, and many other financial institutions, are now accelerating their ESG education efforts. \"The ESG education sector is expected to gain more accurate policy support, draw in more talents to get involved, and generate greater demand, forming a virtuous circle, Wang from China Energy Research Society added. zhengyiran@chinadaily.com.cn",

        "content": "Every morning, each person rolls out of bed to the soothing sound of bones and joints creaking, cracking and popping! We all walk (shuffle) stiffly to the bathroom to brush our teeth. It takes our bodies a while to stretch out, and our joints to get on board with moving freely after a night of rest. This stiffness is normal and can be attributed to the extended sedentary stay in bed, hopefully around seven to eight hours per night. The same stiffness can be felt after a long car ride, watching a movie on the couch or working at your desk for too long. This is because movement begets mobility. We are all familiar with Isaac Newton’s law, \"an object in motion stays in motion...\" That law applies to our joints and muscles, too! Where a lot of people go wrong is they think, \"Ouch, I hurt, moving more will make me hurt so I should sit still.\" In fact, it is quite the opposite. Movement brings blood flow to your muscles and delivers nutrients and oxygen, breathing new life into your muscles when you use them! Movement will also lubricate the connective tissue in your joints, making them less stiff and more mobile. Simply walking every day will greatly reduce pain by preventing the body from stiffening up, your muscles becoming hardened and your joints locking up. Think of a vehicle: If a car sits in the driveway all winter, everything gets hardened and rusty, the belts get taunt, and the fluids get sludge-like. It is no different with your musculoskeletal system. The goal is to keep everything loose, warmed up and moving freely for optimal performance in daily functioning. This can be achieved by walking daily. Another great way to keep your body agile is stretching and bending across multiple planes of movement. We tend to do activities that are right in front of us: pushing a grocery cart, typing on our keyboard, driving, reading and the list goes on. This tends to cause our shoulders to slump forward and our heads to bow, and creates a lot of posture, back pain and health problems. When is the last time you moved your body laterally? Dancing, rock climbing, tennis, ice skating and skiing are great activities for lateral movement of our trunk and extremities. Making sure we do not lose flexibility to move across different planes is critical to maintaining our health and longevity. Lateral movement doesn’t have to involve any hardcore, advanced exercises or sports. Consistently stretching, bending and breathing into different planes of movement will provide pain relief and help maintain flexibility. Movement is medicine. And the best part is, it’s free and has zero negative side effects! Movement is akin to letting your muscles breathe and eat. It is necessary for health and longevity of your vessel. \"But my back really hurts, how am I supposed to dance and rock climb?\" There is a difference between pain and discomfort. I don’t believe in the \"no pain, no gain\" mentality that the body builders of the 1980s promoted, but I do believe there is a threshold for discomfort that can be pushed. As much as exercise and movement provides undeniable health benefits, it does come with some risk. If you’re moving your body, there is a potential for injury. But guess what? Sitting on your couch causes potential risks and harm too. The potential for pain is there either way. Mara Casler Exercise shouldn’t be painful, but it should be slightly uncomfortable. Learning to push yourself past what feels comfortable is a skill that is built over time through exercise experience. There is a difference between \"redlining\" in an exercise, and exerting a big effort. Rate your discomfort of the exercise on a scale of 1 to 10. If you start to near the 8 to 10 mark, consider modifying the activity, taking a break, and hydrating. After your heart rate comes down and you catch your breath, reassess how you feel and try again! Remember: Movement begets movement. The more you move, the more you want to move and the better you’ll feel. Sitting around, waiting for the pain to go away so that you can exercise, is not the way to heal. Heal yourself through movement by pushing past the initial discomfort and learning when you need to modify. If you treat yourself like you are full of aches and pains, that’s how you will feel. If you treat your body like an athlete, that’s how you will feel. Choose to feel good — choose movement.

        "content": "The Karlovy Vary Film Festival (KVIFF) has unveiled its competition and other lineups for its 58th edition, set to run in the Czech spa town from June 28 to July 6. It also set its competition jury, led by indie film producer who will be joined by Australian actor , Hungarian director Gábor Reisz, Icelandic poet and novelist Sjón and Czech actress Eliška Křenková.. Organizers highlighted 15 directorial or feature-directorial debuts in this year’s official selection and various world premieres. In its special screenings lineup, KVIFF will present the world premiere of Ukrainian filmmaker and former Kremlin prisoner . Sentsov “is currently defending his homeland as a lieutenant in the Ukrainian army, which he joined in the first days of the Russian invasion in February 2022,” the film description provided by the fest reads. “During one assault, his infantry fighting vehicle was destroyed by enemy artillery. His attempts to organize the evacuation of part of his unit were complicated by the lack of ammunition and incessant Russian fire. The name of the operation was Real, and Sentsov’s eponymous film is a unique immersive experience that offers a hyper-documentary insight into the reality of the war through the eyes of one direct participant.” Among this year’s KVIFF competition lineup are Iveta Grófová’s , which depicts the rise of nationalism in Slovakia in the 1940s, and Bruno Anković’s , a film adaptation of a novel about a Croatian village between the years 1926 and 1945 where right-wing ideology rises. from Japanese director Yukihiro Morigakia, about a marriage “steadily losing its spark,” will also compete for the festival’s Crystal Globe honor for best competition film. The competition also features such established names as , who brings , about British modern painter Wilhelmina Barns-Graham, to Karlovy Vary, as well as Noaz Deshe who will debut , about a Greek refugee camp where Syrian and Palestinian asylum seekers await news of their refugee status. Organizers on Tuesday also unveiled the program for Karlovy Vary’s Proxima sidebar, which aims to put the spotlight on bold works by young filmmakers and renowned auteurs alike. This year, it includes films about the hotel room as a place where everybody is a stranger, leftist students being interrupted by the visit of members of a right-wing movement, and , directed by Victoria Verseau, a documentary diary about the filmmaker’s return to Thailand where she underwent her transition in 2012. The Karlovy Vary team noticed several themes cutting across various movies in the lineup. “Freshly revisionist takes on the esthetical canons of a period film. A balanced, caring but also provocative look [at] the fate of a woman in ... contemporary society ... The immediate influence of political events on the life of an individual human being anywhere in the world. My colleagues and I discovered these themes running through our selection of films,” highlighted . He also touted a global cinematic lineup with new works. “15 out of 32 films featured in the official selection are debuts, and we could not be more excited they are accompanied by the brand new works of renowned filmmakers of the likes of Mark Cousins, Oleh Sentsov, Noaz Deshe, Antonin Peretjatko, Beata Parkanova and Burak Cevik,” he said. Check out the full KVIFF official selection with descriptions of the films below. / Director: Yukihiro Morigaki Japan, 2023, 105 min, World premiere An unsettling drama about a marriage which is steadily losing its spark. Momoko (Noriko Eguchi) leads a respectable life as a housewife. She dresses elegantly and ensures that the apartment looks just right, down to the last detail; she attends to her husband assiduously and goes to great lengths to cook him proper Japanese food. Are these expressions of love, or rather paranoia from the emotional chasm that has opened out between them? And when does devoted care become an obsession? A psychologically precise case history of a spent relationship, in which long suppressed pain has risen to the surface. A film that examines the dark corners of human frustration and hysteria, where the desire to create something good develops into the urge to destroy. Director: Margarida Cardoso Portugal, France, Netherlands, 2024, 127 min, International premiere In 1907, Alonso arrives on Prince’s Island, where he has been tasked with treating a group of workers plagued by a mysterious affliction called , also known as slave nostalgia. Those affected feel an intense homesickness, fall into apathy, lose the strength to live, and eventually die. Alonso slowly discovers that it is not enough to treat the physical symptoms; he must understand the soul of those who have been uprooted. The oppressive atmosphere of the isolated tropical island forms the backdrop for a story from the dark colonial past in which humanity is put to the ultimate test. is also a reminder that there is more than one way to interpret the past, and that behind every story is a person telling the story. / Director: Nelicia Low Singapore, Taiwan, Poland, 2024, 109 min, World premiere After Han is released from juvenile prison, where he served seven years for killing an opponent in a fencing match, he meets his younger brother and insists on his innocence. Jie believes him, and the torn brotherly bond begins to heal. Behind their mother’s back, Han helps Jie perfect his fencing skills so that he can qualify for the national championships. But the initially energetic clinking of sabres is slowly drowned out by silent doubts: is Han really innocent? Nelicia Low’s gripping atmospheric thriller offers a nerve-wracking duel between the ideals of brotherly love and the illusions that we project onto those close to us. / Director: Peter Hoogendoorn Netherlands, Belgium, 2024, 85 min, World premiere Just as he does every year, dad flies from sunny Portugal for a three-day visit to the Netherlands, the drab country of his birth. He has his usual errands to run and he visits his doctor for his annual check-up, accompanied by his eccentric grown-up son... This intimate film offers a glimpse into the relationship between two men who have grown apart yet, as they engage in seemingly mundane activities, little by little they try to find their way back to one another. , the second outing by Dutch filmmaker Peter Hoogendoorn, is a gentle drama, interlaced with the dry humour typical for the region. The director’s feature debut premiered at the Venice IFF. / Director: Lilja Ingolfsdottir Norway, 2024, 101 min, World premiere While Sigmund is always away on business, Maria juggles her career with childcare and managing the home. Like many other relationships, theirs was also all about love and harmony in the early stages, however, after years of married life, the cracks started to appear. Sigmund is ultimately the one to ask for a divorce, and Maria is forced to confront her greatest fears. While ostensibly a divorce drama, this debut by writer-director Lilja Ingolfsdottir nevertheless takes us further, delivering a multilayered character study of a woman experiencing a crisis that leads her to self-knowledge. isn’t a story about the quest for true love; on the contrary, it takes a fresh approach to examine contemporary ideas of romance, equality within the relationship, and the power of womanhood. / Director: Iveta Grófová Slovak Republic, Czech Republic, 2024, 129 min, World premiere It’s the 1940s. The Slovak state witnesses the rise of nationalism and it’s not an auspicious time for minorities. The turbulent social mood also impacts the widow Marika, who loses her job in an Aryanised dressmaker’s shop. Given the increasing anti-Hungarian sentiment she shuts herself away, particularly since she is harbouring a little Jewish boy. Despite this she still finds herself singled out by two men: a German Nazi officer and a captain of Slovakia’s Hlinka Guard. This drama by Slovak director Iveta Grófová is an adaptation of the novella of the same name by Peter Krištúfek, which conjures up the dramatic atmosphere of wartime Slovakia. The story of a fragmented era, which forces the protagonists to confront complex dilemmas, is told not only through words, but also by way of a powerful visual language. / Director: Adam Martinec Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, 2024, 84 min, World premiere The pig-killing fest on an old farm is a tradition Karel looks forward to every year. It’s the only chance for the whole family to get together, have a good time, engage in a squabble or two, and enjoy some great food. But this time things are different. The butcher hides the fact his cartridges are damp, grampa can’t bring himself to tell Karel, recently widowed, that this slaughter will be their last, daughter Lucie is depressed after her marital breakup, and grandson Dušík runs away while his parents argue over whether he’s old enough to watch the kill. As for Karel, the pig’s blood spilling everywhere is the last straw... Adam Martinec’s feature debut is a remarkably incisive study of the Czech temperament which, through its visceral character portrayal and searing humour, evokes the masterworks of the Czechoslovak New Wave. / Director: George Sikharulidze Georgia, France, Italy, Romania, 2024, 95 min, World premiere When Sandro’s father decides to devote his life to God and leaves for a monastery, the teenage introvert finds himself deprived of the fundamental certainties of life. Abandoned by his father and his mother, who is working abroad, the young man embarks on a journey of self-discovery, opening up both to a new friendship with the radical Lasha, who has ties with an ultra-right organisation, and also to the chance to explore his own sexuality. George Sikharulidze’s perceptive feature debut considers how fine the line is between the observer and the observed, and asks where contemporary post-Soviet Georgian society is heading as it hovers on the border between religious conservatism and nationalisation on the one hand, and the desire for independence and modernisation on the other. / Director: Bruno Anković Croatia, Qatar, 2024, 86 min, World premiere Bruno Anković’s feature film debut is set in an impoverished Croatian village between the years 1926 and 1945. The constant deprivation, repeated changes to the regime, and war pervaded the forests and shrouded the place in a miasma that obscured all visions of a better future. Village life was also tough for Mijo: His young, innocent soul was burdened by the outside world and troubled by inhumane orders, and he then fell prey to the false sheen of right-wing ideology. This film adaptation of the successful novel of the same name by Damir Karakaš presents us with wonderful shots of the rural landscape, but it is also a testimony of commonplace brutality and demonstrates the reasons why innocent people become easy quarry for ideological crusaders. Director: Mark Cousins United Kingdom, 2024, 88 min, World premiere One of the most important women in British modern art, the painter Wilhelmina Barns-Graham was a highly inspirational figure, whose work was deeply impacted by a pivotal event in her life. In May 1949, this leading representative of the modernist St Ives group of artists climbed to the top of the Grindelwald glacier in Switzerland, an experience which was to transform the way she saw the world. She spent the rest of her life capturing its shapes and colours, indeed its very essence. In his essayistic portrait documentarist Mark Cousins delves into complex themes of gender, climate change and creativity, while laying bare the artist’s character and vast imagination so pervasively that he creates the impression we are seeing the world through her eyes. / Director: Beata Parkanová Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, 2024, 74 min, World premiere Amálka is six years old. She loves her cat, her parents, and her gran and grampa. It’s summertime and all the little girl could wish for is for the day to turn out just as it should. Except that things are different. Her parents have shut themselves in a room and she can hear raised voices through the door, which isn’t normal. Something’s going on and Amálka has no idea what it is. In a superbly creative direction from Beata Parkanová, follows a family break-up as perceived by a child: Through the keyhole, ear pressed to the door, everything seen at adult waist height.Each day has to end, and this one has brought Amálka to the point of no return. She feels the hurt as she drifts off to sleep, but she has also grown up a little. Director: Noaz Deshe Germany, France, 2024, 95 min, World premiere Xoftex is a Greek refugee camp, where Syrian and Palestinian asylum seekers anxiously wait for news of their refugee status. To pass the time between interviews with the immigration office, Nasser and his friends film satirical sketches and make preparations for a zombie horror flick. Except that the reality of the camp could be taken for a horror scenario itself. The tension between its inhabitants gains momentum and every conflict removes one more brick from the wall which divides reality from dream – or, indeed, nightmare. Fragments of real life, humour, and the unimaginable suffering of people risking their lives to escape their own country, merge into an explosive, at times, surreal spectacle which invites the viewers to immerse themselves in the story and the lives of immigrants in a way they will never have experienced before. / Director: Pavel G. Vesnakov Bulgaria, Italy, 2024, 93 min, World premiere After years away Kaloyan returns to his native Bulgaria in order to sell his late father’s flat. What at first seems like a routine task devoid of emotion gradually develops into a journey to the depths of his being, where he is confronted with distant traumas, yet he also strikes a new path towards self-discovery. While childhood is filled with sensations and the rustling wind, adulthood is a state of fragile windless and fading memories of those closest to us. Vesnakov delivers colourful existential reflections on the nature of family bonds and personal identity over the course of time. Yet he also muses on modern-day Bulgaria, where the cemeteries of its original inhabitants are being replaced by shady casinos, and where cultural memory is waning in a country deceived by an illusory vision of economic prosperity. Director: Abdellah Taïa France, Morocco, 2024, 76 min, World premiere Two young people, Soundouss and Jaâfar, arrive at a luxury villa in the resort of Cabo Negro rented by Jaâfar’s lover, who is supposed to join them later. But something is wrong – he still hasn’t turned up, and they can’t reach him on his phone. Left on their own, they decide, despite their uncertain financial and personal situation, to enjoy their holiday as much as their minds and bodies will allow. On vacation, with time seemingly non-existent, they take the opportunity to reflect on their relationships back home – and on the future, which feels so distant here on the sun-drenched beach. Writer-director Abdellah Taïa presents a queer ode to the seemingly carefree time of youth. / Director: Ivana Gloria Italy, 2023, 75 min, International premiere Green-haired Maia is tired of city life and, driven by a desire to be among nature, she decides to spend the summer picking oranges. In the orchards she is greeted by the gardener, an eccentric loner called Teo, who notices that Maia isn’t like everyone else. In the same way he tends his plants, he devotes his time and energy to her, too, and the young woman starts to blossom. Their burgeoning friendship, however, is unsettled by the arrival of Teo’s father and older brother Arturo, who are planning a celebration in a neighbouring village... In her richly coloured story, which shows it’s sometimes difficult to find someone who could help us to discover our true selves, director Ivana Gloria awakens within us senses that we didn’t even know we had. / Director: Anja Kreis Germany, Moldova, France, 2024, 95 min, World premiere Varvara, a professor of philosophy, is discussing the concept of God’s death with her students. She is visited by her sister Angelina, an eminent gynecologist who has been recalled from Moscow and sent to another city, where she is to reduce the number of abortions. Not long afterwards a girl comes to see her at the hospital, asking her to perform an abortion, claiming that she is carrying the Antichrist in her womb. After a heated dispute with a student, Varvara ponders the presence of evil in human nature, while Angelina carries out an illegal abortion on the girl and takes the embryo home with her... This mystical film by Anja Kreis is beguiling for its ominous atmosphere and raises uncomfortable questions about human conscience, morality and faith, although it declines to provide definitive answers. / Director: Burak Çevik Turkey, Germany, South Korea, 2024, 76 min, International premiere One evening, one apartment, five leftist students, and one vision of a non-violent socialist revolution. When this gathering is interrupted by the unannounced visit of two members of a right-wing movement, things quickly spiral out of control. Turkish director Burak Çevik uses long takes and an enclosed space as a canvas onto which his ensemble cast’s strong performances paint a story reflecting the turbulent political situation in 1978 Ankara. How far are people willing to go for their political beliefs, and how much can the ideology of a group influence the behavior of an individual? holds up a mirror to more than one revolution. / Director: Zhengfan Yang USA, China, Netherlands, Norway, France, 2024, 113 min, World premiere The hotel room as a place where everybody is a stranger. A place that is yours for just a moment. A temporarily intimate space entered by a maid in order to clean it while, if possible, not leaving a single trace of her visit. Each part of the episodic is set in just such a place. One episode equals one shot. One shot equals one story. What they have in common is China, the home country of both guests and staff, although each of their lives differs from the others. The film’s absurd, darkly humorous, poignant, and mysterious stories are set in a seemingly confined space that nevertheless opens up new and surprising dimensions with each episode. Director: Paula Ďurinová Slovak Republic, Germany, 2024, 65 min, World premiere In her feature debut director Paula Ďurinová sets out to wander among varied rock formations in order to try and come to terms with the loss of her grandparents. Different stages of grief unfold among the sea currents, the dark caves and the volcanic wasteland, while the strings of an autoharp resonate in the ravines. finds a unique balance between the personal and the environmental in a modernistic requiem full of perceptive observations on natural phenomena and on man himself. This is a work that excels in its inner strength and rare film language, where sea waves reflect shifting thoughts, and where the erosion of arid soil is reminiscent of a broken heart filled with memories of people who are lost to us forever. / Director: Martin Pavol Repka Czech Republic, 2024, 85 min, World premiere A family of five lives together in an old village house. While the parents are slowly aging, the children are growing up, and it is clear that they will soon go their own way. This unchanging rhythm of everyday life is disrupted by the unexpected news of the mother’s pregnancy, and the idea of a new sibling gradually affects all members of the household. is an understated, intimate portrait of family togetherness, which is often expressed in the smallest of ways. An unassuming yet highly original story, filmed with the same tenderness and patience with which nature awakens every spring. Director: Subhadra Mahajan India, 2024, 104 min, World premiere Desolate after experiencing a traumatic incident, Mia travels to the family’s summer retreat amid the snow-covered Himalayas in order to regain her strength. There she finds the company of the caretaker’s mother-in-law, Bimal, and her grandson, Sunny. Irrespective of their differing ages, social background and their ideas of happiness, a surprisingly strong bond develops between them, which cannot be broken, not even by the arrival of someone who drives Mia straight back into her trauma. This visually mesmerising film offers an authentic and vivid depiction of the process of coping with female pain and demonstrates that a second chance might emerge where we least expect it. Director: Victoria Verseau Sweden, France, 2024, 72 min, World premiere “ .” This is how Victoria Verseau introduces her intimate documentary diary, in which she returns to Thailand and to the year 2012, when she underwent her transition. She had long awaited this moment, but then came feelings of uncertainty, amplified by the death of a close friend. The conceptual artist adopts an almost archaeological approach to the past and lays bare the process of writing a personal story that is intrinsically linked to the creation of her own identity. In this deeply felt debut she reveals the joyful aspects and also the dark recesses of transition and, bringing other testimonies into play as well, she critically examines what defines women as women. Director: Omer Tobi Israel, Canada, 2024, 82 min, World premiere A lonely middle-aged woman lives her monotonous life. Every morning, she goes to her job as a supermarket cashier, and every day after work she goes straight home to look after her ailing mother and the rest of the family. Nobody, however, seems to care. Then, the mysterious murder of her boss sets off a chain of events at the end of which she can be free and find her own worth. How to describe her journey? Perhaps best as a sexual odyssey, an exploratory expedition to places where an important role is played by carnality, desire, and its gratification. is a subtly enigmatic reflection on conservatism, prudery, and the false ideal of physical beauty. / Director: Paolo Tizón Peru, Spain, Mexico, 2024, 96 min, World premiere A group of young adventurers sign up for one of the most challenging military training courses in Latin America, which will turn them into fearsome warriors entrusted with overseeing the dangerous VRAEM region, an area filled with coca plants, terrorists, and smugglers. In his absorbing look at the hermetically sealed world of the army, debut director Paolo Tizon paints a portrait of one institution while depicting individual human stories and reflecting on male identity, the potential for self-determination, and a fragile masculinity that stands in striking contrast to the brutal training. Sensitivity alongside violence, beauty alongside vulnerability. / Director: Jan Zajíček Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, 2024, 126 min, World premiere Vladimír 518, uncompromising rapper, artist, stage designer and activist, is a rare phenomenon, who not only writes books, but publishes them as well. Today also a respected authority primarily on pre-1989 architecture, he has written not only a major publication on the subject, but also the story for two audiovisual works treating the same theme, which were shot by Jan Zajíček, renowned director of music videos. In addition to the recent TV series we have the eagerly anticipated feature film which, through its fascinating and impressive exploration of Czech and Slovak architecture of the latter half of the 20th century, offers exclusive insight into extraordinary buildings and unique individuals living below the Tatra Mountains. Director: Alireza Ghasemi, Raha Amirfazli Iran, France, Netherlands, 2024, 95 min, European premiere The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan led to a massive flight of Afghans to neighboring Iran, which – since they hoped to find a new home there – they called the “Land of Brothers.” But the dream of fraternal coexistence soon faded, Iranian law never accepted them as equal citizens, and so even the descendants of the first refugees still carry the burden of otherness. Alireza Ghasemi and Raha Amirfazli’s wistful, beautifully shot feature debut about a family who will never feel at home in the country where they live won over audiences immediately upon its premiere at Sundance. / Director: Klára Tasovská Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Austria, 2024, 90 min This year’s notional award for excellence on the domestic film front should unquestionably go to the unique documentary on the internationally renowned photographic legend Libuše Jarcovjáková, a work which enchanted just about everyone at the 2024 Berlinale. This remarkable project by Klára Tasovská and her team looks back over the past fifty years at the life of a true icon, known as the Czech Nan Goldin, and this via a fascinating montage of several thousand of her photographs and her diary entries, which she reads out herself. Portraits, self-portraits, immortalised moments, the quest for truth lying deep within nameless fellow opponents of grim Normalisation, reflections of the transformation of body and soul, black-and-white images, emotion and life in flashes of brilliant light. / Director: Vadim Jendreyko Switzerland, 2024, 136 min, International premiere What is Europe? In his highly topical personal essay, Vadim Jendreyko travels across the old continent to discover its essence in places that might be called acupuncture points of European identity. His various stops include the bottom of the Rhine, Greek docks, the European Parliament, a primeval forest in Poland, and a Sarajevo library. All of these places invite ambivalent reflections: on the one hand, they celebrate Europe’s diversity and the breadth of its cultural heritage; on the other hand, they are symbols of turbulence, conflict, and bloody history. Is Europe condemned to be stuck in a vicious circle of violence, or is there hope in those who try to sing the songs of others? Director: Oleh Sentsov Ukraine, Croatia, 2024, 90 min, World premiere Acclaimed filmmaker, activist, Sakharov Prize-winning former Kremlin prisoner, and soldier Oleh Sentsov is currently defending his homeland as a lieutenant in the Ukrainian army, which he joined in the first days of the Russian invasion in February 2022. During one assault, his infantry fighting vehicle was destroyed by enemy artillery. His attempts to organize the evacuation of part of his unit were complicated by the lack of ammunition and incessant Russian fire. The name of the operation was Real, and Sentsov’s eponymous film is a unique immersive experience that offers a hyper-documentary insight into the reality of the war through the eyes of one direct participant. / Director: Marie-Magdalena Kochová Czech Republic, 2024, 85 min, World premiere In her feature-length debut, Marie-​Mag­da­le­na Kochová uses the character of eighteen-year-old Johanna to explore the phenomenon of “glass children” – children who, because they have a special-needs sibling, are neglected by their family, however unintentionally. They often feel invisible, their problems are always considered less important, and they are often expected to help take care of their disabled brother or sister. Johana is about to graduate from high school, and so she must decide whether to leave home to study, or stay and help her parents. An immensely sensitive account of the nature of sibling love which, for once, puts “the other one” first. Director: Marek Najbrt Czech Republic, 2024, 94 min, World premiere “Foot Soldiers”, “Attention aux hommes”, “Dancer”, “Repetition”... These are just some of the string of hits by Prague band Tata Bojs. Always energetic, capable of myriad transformations, precise in their conceptual approach to the visual and musical interpretation of individual albums and concerts. It’s no surprise that Marek Najbrt ( ) decided not to go for the conventional documentary. He tells the band’s story as a playful collage, pieced together from a wealth of archive material and recordings of concerts and futuristic stage performances with the Vosto5 theatre company. Thus, unfolding before our very eyes is a portrait of a highly original band which, despite the alternative nature of its output, has earned its rightful place among the country’s top players. / Director: Jiří Mádl Czech Republic, 2024, 131 min, World premiere One might think that Czech and Slovak filmmakers have already said all there is to say about the period around 1968 in Czechoslovak history. As Jiří Mádl’s latest outing shows, however, this crucial era in our modern history still has forgotten stories to offer that are worthy of our attention. The film revolves around the international news office at Czechoslovak Radio, a place full of talented individuals possessing broad insight, linguistic skills, and above all a commitment to honest journalistic work with a focus on the truth. An epic, dynamically shot, rewarding film, which embraces uncommon heroism in the face of an oppressive regime, the strength of fraternal ties, and the eternal themes of love, betrayal, morality, and hope. / Director: Antonin Peretjatko France, 2024, 62 min, International premiere Within the first month of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, more than 12.5 million people were forced to flee their homes and 5 million fled the country altogether. Documentary filmmaker Antonin Peretjatko returns to Lviv with Andrei, who has left with his family for France, to retrieve Andrei’s personal belongings and to explore his own roots, but most importantly to record eyewitness testimony from people who have remained in Ukraine. Part reportage documentary and part poetic road movie with an aesthetic style reminiscent of the early French New Wave, tries to share with the viewer what everyday life looks like in a war-torn country. / Director: Jiří Havelka Czech Republic, 2023, 104 min, World premiere A true story of injustice perpetrated on a peaceful gardener by a wealthy neighbor meets Karel Čapek’s eponymous literary work about a gardener’s hardships and successes over the course of a year. Director Jiří Havelka, one of the most complex artistic personalities of our time, has long proved that “alternative” and “audience-friendly” need not be mutually exclusive. His quietly moving tragicomic story about a remarkably stubborn struggle for the right to a dignified life is built on two great performances by the always outstanding Oldřich Kaiser and Dáša Vokata.

        "description": "There are conflicting reports over the alleged Guptas arrest in India this week in connection with a suicide. Here’s what we know so far ...",
        "content": "Confusion reigns over the apparent Guptas arrest in India this week. This follows the suicide of a high-profile builder. According to India Today , two of the three Gupta brothers were arrested in Uttarakhand this past weekend. Many believed news of the Guptas arrest in India this past weekend was a positive break for South Africa. Authorities have been trying to get the brothers extradited to face charges for looting billions of Rands through state capture. It is estimate state capture cost South Africa as much as R613 billion during Zuma’s tenure as ANC president. GUPTAS ARREST IN INDIA Late last year, Deputy President Paul Mashatile and Justice Minister Ronald Lamola went to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to facilitate the extradition of Atul and Rajesh Gupta. However, the Guptas appear to have fled to India. The National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) confirms that the Guptas are wanted on money laundering and fraud charges in South Africa. After fleeing South Africa on a private plane, they were arrested in the UAE in June 2022, following Interpol’s intervention. Now, following the alleged Guptas arrest in India, the NDPP has the task of getting Indian authorities to declare them fugitives in that country, too. TWO OUT OF THREE According to reports, two of the three Gupta brothers were arrested on Saturday after Satinder Singh Sawhney named them in his suicide note before jumping off a building. IOL reports the Guptas arrest in India was facilitated after Sawhney’s letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the Guptas threatened him. As a result, this lead him to take his own life. His son, Ranvir Sahni, lodged the complaint against the Guptas with police. Furthermore, Sahni said his father was constantly threatened by Ajay and Anil Gupta, over financial matters. A written complaint was submitted to the local police in May 2023 about the Gupta’s threats, harassment, intimidation, and blackmail. This provided the prima facie evidence for the Guptas arrest in India and both were produced in court this past Saturday, confirmed Senior Police Superintendent Ajay Singh. THE ‘WRONG’ GUPTAS However, confusion reigns over whether these are the correct Guptas. Justice Minister Ronald Lamola says preliminary investigations indicate the arrested pair are not the Guptas South Africa wants, reports TimesLive . “According to the information at our disposal, verified by our high commissioner in India, the Guptas that have been arrested are not the ones we want. Per the warrant of arrest issued by South Africa, and the red notice issued by Interpol, it is not Ajay and Atul Gupta,” asserts Lamola. However, investigative journalism website amaBhungane has confirmed that the images of the Gupta brothers behind bars are indeed the ‘correct’ brothers. It reports that the photograph provided by Indian journalist Ankit Paliwal, is of Ajay Gupta and his brother-in-law Anil Gupta, in a jail cell in Rajpur.

        "content": "Inilahad ni Danica Sotto na hindi niya naiwasang mapikon sa intriga na nambabae umano ang kaniyang mister na si Marc Pingris. Sa panayam ng “Updated with Nelson Canlas” podcast, sinabi ni Danica na nakapag-move on na sila ni Marc sa naturang isyu pero may mga nais siyang linawin. Noong kainitan ng alegasyon, sinabi ni Danica na nag-post siya ng quote tungkol sa betrayal at loyalty sa kaniyang Instagram Stories. Pero paglilinaw niya, ibang tao ang kaniyang pinatutungkulan sa post. “I post because I like the quote or sometimes, noong time na iyon, aaminin ko, it was a feeling that I was feeling about someone else, na parang napipikon ako sa isang tao. And that is a person na nangloko sa amin sa negosyo. A person we truly trusted,” paliwanag niya. Hanggang ngayon, pinagdadaanan pa raw nila ang sinasabing pagsubok sa negosyo. “This tabloid, ang ginawa, kinuha ‘yung quote ko na ‘yun. Sinabi na I'm confirming daw the issue kasi pinapatamaan ko daw si Marc. Pero hindi na ako nagsalita,” sabi pa ni Danica. Dahil sa nangyari, sinabi ni Danica na nag-usap sila ni Marc at nagkasundo na huwag nang mag-post ng tungkol sa mga quote na maaaring maging iba ang pagkakaunawa ng makakabasa. “So, parang doon pumasok 'yung communication namin na usap,” anang aktres. “Tapos ako naman sa side ko, pinagsabihan ko lang siya na, ingat sa mga nakakasama, ingat sa mga pinupuntahan. Minsan kasi, sa'yo wala lang ‘yun, you're too friendly or—hindi friendly, accommodating. Diba? ‘Yung parang, oh, ito chika-chika. Ganoon naman mga basketball player e,” dagdag ni Danica. Sinabi rin ni Danica na hindi niya naiwasan na mahaluan ng tawa ang pagkapikon dahil may mga tao na mahusay na \"magtahi-tahi\" ng kuwento. “Tapos ‘yun lang gagawin ng mga tao, gagawan ng butas, pagdidikit-dikitin, tatagpi-tagpiin,” sabi pa ni Danica na dahilan para mabigyan ng malisya at ibang kulay ang post. Ayon kay Danica, hindi na siya naapektuhan ng mga tsismis dahil nasanay na siya bilang bahagi ng showbiz industry. “Ang dami pa nga nilang may mga chinismis pa sila before about my dad, (Vic Sotto). May ganito daw na anak na. Oh my gosh, ang sinungaling talaga,” patuloy niya. Gayunman, aminado ang aktres na ibang usapan kapag idinadamay ang kaniyang mga anak. “Siyempre, napikon ako pag anak mo na ‘yung tinitira. May sasabihin na masama, na very very foul,” paglalahad niya. “I think 'yung foul doon is parang may mga sinabi na it's the karma of my parents. ‘Yung ganoon.” Dagdag niya, “Ang rude. Diba na parang, oh yeah, dahil sa mga kasalanan ng mga magulang kaya nagsasabi. Parang gusto kong sabihin, first of all, mali ang statement na ‘yan. And pangalawa, hindi niyo alam ‘yung buong story. Nag-speculate na kayo hindi niyo alam kung anong totoo at hindi.” Nitong nakaraang Marso, naintriga si Marc na kasama ang aktres na si Kim Rodriguez dahil sa parehong larawan nila na may background ng Sydney Opera House, na kuha pala sa magkaibang pagkakataon nang magkahiwalay na namasyal sa lugar ang dalawa. \"Walang katotohanan ang mga lumalabas na balita tungkol sa amin ni Ms. Kim Rodriguez. Walang namamagitan sa aming dalawa gaya ng sinasabi ng ibang tao,\" ani Marc sa isang post para linaw ang naturang intriga sa social media. \"OK kami ng pamilya ko. Wag na po tayo magpakalat ng mga balita na hindi totoo. Humihingi po kami ng respeto para hindi madamay ang mga anak namin ni Danica. Salamat po at God bless po,\" pakiusap niya. Itinanggi rin ni Kim ang maling hinala tungkol sa kanila ni Marc. — FRJ, GMA Integrated News",

        "content": "University of California, Santa Cruz graduate students and other academic workers in the UAW 4811 union begin a strike and are joined by UCSC students for Justice in Palestine as they picket the main entrance to campus on Monday, May 20, 2024, in Santa Cruz, Calif. (Shmuel Thaler/The Santa Cruz Sentinel via AP) LOS ANGELES – A rolling strike by unionized academic workers upset about the University of California’s response to pro Palestinian protests at various campuses will come to UCLA beginning Tuesday as part of the second wave of union walkouts. Workers represented by United Auto Workers Local 4811 have already been striking at UC Santa Cruz in what the union called the first wave of planned walkouts. According to the union, the second round of strikes will begin Tuesday at UCLA and UC Davis. The strike is “in response to egregious unfair labor practices that UC has committed, including summoning militarized police officers from numerous outside law enforcement to violently eject and arrest peaceful protesters at UCLA, UC Irvine, and UC San Diego; making unilateral changes to standards for employee discipline, free speech rights and academic freedom; and disciplining and suspending employees engaged in peaceful protest,” according to the union. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address. I agree to the Terms of Use and acknowledge that I have read the Privacy Policy . The UC system has blasted the union’s allegations and filed unfair labor practice complaints of its own, saying the union’s labor contract has a no-strike provision and that the union’s demands are outside the scope of union labor issues. In a statement released before the union’s strike-authorization vote, officials at the University of California Office of the President said, “UC believes that the vote currently being conducted by UAW leadership sets a dangerous precedent that would introduce non-labor issues into labor agreements. If a strike is allowed for political and social disputes, the associated work stoppages would significantly impact UC’s ability to deliver on its promises to its students, community and the State of California.” The union represents teaching assistants, readers, tutors, student researchers and academic researchers. UAW Local 4811 is asking the UC schools to give amnesty to all academic employees and students who face arrest or disciplinary actions for protesting. The union wants the students to have guarantees of freedom of speech and political expression on campus and is asking for researchers to be able to opt out of funding sources tied to the Israeli Defense Force.

        "content": "Ethan Ampadu has already told Leeds United they must keep Joe Rodon at the club now that his loan spell with the Whites is over. The Elland Road club suffered Championship play-off final heartache at the weekend, losing 1-0 to Southampton at Wembley. Daniel Farke's men now face another term in the second tier, and Ampadu has already told his international team-mate he should stay in Yorkshire, despite them not returning to the top flight. He has one year left to run on his Tottenham contract. Ampadu said earlier this year : \"I'll be pressuring him. He knows that. READ MORE: Joe Rodon has already made his Leeds United feelings clear as play-off final moment spotted \"A lot of Leeds fans enjoyed it when I commented on one of his Instagram photos one time. \"I haven't done it in a while. But we are all telling him to stay. Everyone knows how much we appreciate him and what he has done this year.\" Leeds' hopes of bringing him back to Yorkshire appear slim but Rodon's sentiments before the final suggest the Whites do have a look-in. In an interview with the Mail , the Swansea product said: “It would be nice to have stability and know where I am next season. I’ve always strived to get to the elite level and hopefully I can get back there with Leeds, but you never know. “I don’t want to look too far into the future, although I do love it here and Leeds feels like a second home to me now. I’m just concentrating on giving my best and getting this club back to where it belongs.”",

        "content": "Barbie Imperial took to social media a gym photo with a man behind her and netizens ask if it is Richard Gutierrez. One of the celebrity breakups that left countless hearts broken was the breakup of Richard Gutierrez and Sarah Lahbati. It was in March of this year when the actress confirmed that she and her husband have parted ways. Richard and Sarah’s marriage was blessed with two (2) sons — Zion and Kai, whom they are co-parenting. Both celebrities are currently surrounded by rumors. In the case of the actor, he is currently linked with young actress Barbie Imperial. The speculations linking Richard Gutierrez and Barbie Imperial started when the two (2) celebrities were spotted together in a gastropub in Alabang. Several people saw the two celebrities and there were claims that their gestures show they are very close to each other. After the said photos taken in Alabang stirring reactions online, entertainment writer Ogie Diaz claimed that his source said that Barbie was just entertaining Richard at the restaurant. Allegedly, the actress is one of the shareholders of the restaurant. Recently, Barbie Imperial and Richard Gutierrez were spotted together anew in South Korea . A netizen who has asked for a photo with the actress posted the photos on social media. The two (2) celebrities could be seen walking and seemingly talking to each other as they cross a busy street abroad. Neither Barbie nor Richard have spoke on the issues linking them to each other. There are also speculations that the two (2) celebrities may be doing a project together that is why they are spotted together. However, a recent photo posted by Barbie Imperial on her social media account stirred the confusion of eagle-eyed netizens once again. In a post that is no longer available, based on a report on Pep, the actress shared a gym photo with a man behind her doing a workout. Some netizens speculate that it was Richard Gutierrez. Undeniably, the body built of Richard somehow matches the physique of the man exercising behind Barbie in the photo. Here’s a copy of the photo: Barbie did not write any caption on her post. Based on the article , some netizens speculate that the post of the actress is a “hard launch” or “flex” of Richard.",

        "content": "A man who stalked and attempted to murder the sister of Federal MP Kate Chaney with an axe has been sentenced to 23 years' jail. Christopher Bernard Healey, 56, first met doctor Anna Chaney in 2018 when he became a regular patient of hers at a medical practice in the inner Perth suburb of West Leederville. However in 2020, when Dr Chaney noticed a decline in his mental health, he started sending her and members of her family inappropriate messages, some of them of a sexual nature. The court was told that led to Healey being excluded from the medical practice, but state prosecutor Benjamin Stanwix said that only caused him to become \"enraged and bitter\". \"After being rebuffed in early 2020 and particularly after he was excluded from the practice, he developed an all consuming hatred and bitterness towards Dr Chaney ... that grew ever more intense,\" Mr Stanwix submitted. Restraining order breached The court was told he continued to try to contact Dr Chaney, so in January 2021 she obtained a violence restraining order against him, which over the ensuing years he repeatedly breached. That included using social media to send messages to her family members as well as making a false complaint against her to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). Mr Stanwix said at one point Dr Chaney reported Healey to the police but she was incorrectly told his behaviour did not amount to a breach because the contact was not directly with her. In some of the messages he sent family members, he falsely accused Dr Chaney of doing him \"a grave injustice\" and said \"everything I have is centred on the anger I have towards Anna\". Mr Stanwix said by about September 2022, Healey had \"formed a fixed intention to kill her\" and he set about finding out where she worked \"so he could attend to kill her.\" Then in September 2023, about nine months after the restraining order expired, he scoped out the North Perth clinic where she was working and lied to staff to find out when she was next on duty. Mr Stanwix said Healey also bought an ice pick, a hunting knife and an axe with the intention of using one of them to kill her. On the morning of September 28 last year, he hid the axe in a cardboard sleeve before he gained access to to the practice again by lying to staff. When Dr Chaney was in her room having a consultation with a patient who was 12 weeks pregnant, he walked in, stood in front of her and swung down the axe on her. Mr Stanwix said Dr Chaney was hit in the abdomen and suffered a large laceration which bled profusely. As she yelled \"Chris don't do this\", she and the patient struggled with him. Healey then yelled \"she's ruined my life\" before another doctor entered the room and managed to grab the axe and stop the attack. The court was told during the struggle the patient was hit in the temple, probably by Healey's elbow, and as a result he had endangered her life. Search reveals 'obsession' Mr Stanwix said a search of Healey's home found extensive handwritten notes which showed his \"obsession\" with Dr Chaney. Healey pleaded guilty to six charges including the attempted murder of Dr Chaney, endangering the life of her patient, aggravated stalking and possessing a controlled weapon. Healey's lawyer Edward Fitzpatrick described his client as \"a very complicated man\", saying despite his guilty pleas, he still held the same beliefs. Mr Fitzpatrick said Healey had a history of mental health issues and it was likely he had Autism Spectrum Disorder and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Mr Stanwix submitted that Healey should receive a lengthy jail term, saying Dr Chaney had shown nothing but kindness towards him, even when he had behaved inappropriately to her. \"This is a case of a man not getting what he wanted from a woman, and as a consequence she had to die,\" Mr Stanwix said. Healey will have to serve 21 years of his sentence before he can apply to be released on parole. Want more local WA news? Select \" from either the or the settings menu .",

        "content": "Herd boy brutally murders employer over unpaid wages In a horrific turn of events, a 24-year-old herd boy named Mkholeli Ndlovu has been arraigned before the Beitbridge Magistrates’ Court, facing a charge of murder. According to the state’s allegations, the incident occurred on November 13th, 2022, at around 9 PM in Chadeda village. Ndlovu, who was employed as the herd boy of the now-deceased, Teboka Sebata (58), reportedly engaged in a dispute with Sebata over his outstanding wages. The court heard that when Ndlovu asked Sebata for his pay, she informed him that she did not have the money to settle the debt at that moment. Enraged by her response, Ndlovu grabbed an axe and viciously struck Sebata multiple times on the head and neck, leading to her untimely death. After the brutal attack, Ndlovu took the victim’s kitchen utensils and cell phone before fleeing the scene. Sebata succumbed to the extensive head and neck injuries inflicted by the accused. Ndlovu remained on the run for 18 months, until he was finally apprehended in Kwekwe on May 20th, 2024. The police were able to track him down by tracing the deceased’s cell phone, which he had stolen during the incident. The accused has been remanded in custody and is scheduled to appear in court again on June 7th, 2024. As the judicial process unfolds, the community grapples with the aftermath of this harrowing incident, seeking solace and hoping that the legal system will provide a measure of closure and justice for the victims and their loved ones.",

        "content": "A young girl's obsession with Yorkshire puddings has been cured by hypnotherapy, allowing her to enjoy a variety of foods for the first time in years. Tallulah Dent, aged 11, had been feasting on six Aunt Bessie's plain Yorkshire puddings daily since she was four, consuming at least 24 each week and even opting for them over traditional Christmas fare. The habit was so ingrained that Tallulah, from Staffordshire , would feel nauseous at the thought of trying new foods, such as cheese sandwiches or chicken, often leading to physical sickness. Her mother, Gemma, made numerous attempts to introduce different foods into Tallulah's diet, but success was limited to the occasional ham sandwich or slice of cheese pizza, with Yorkshire puddings remaining her steadfast preference. After a particularly upsetting experience with chicken and vegetables, Tallulah courageously asked her mum to find help, which led them to cognitive behavioural hypnotherapist David Kilmurry following an ARFID diagnosis - avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder. Read more: Following 12 weeks of intensive hypnotherapy, Tallulah has made significant progress and is now exploring a range of new foods. Gemma, 41, expressed her relief, recalling how Tallulah's selective eating began: \"When she came back one day from nursery she just started refusing certain foods.\" \"She used to eat chicken dippers and that was fine but then one day she refused to eat them because she said they looked different. I made everything from scratch for my kids. She used to eat absolutely everything.\" \"I thought it was a phase and just thought she would outgrow it but she just point blank refused almost all foods except Yorkshire puddings. She would eat an entire plate of them for dinner.\" \"One Christmas she just had a plate of Yorkshire puddings while we all had Christmas dinner with the trimmings. I just felt like I was a bad parent and worried about her health.\" (Image: No credit) \"She physically couldn't put other foods to her lips. You'd see her go red and she'd be shaking, it was horrendous. She wanted to try the food but she couldn't physically not put it near her mouth.\" \"She used to say, 'what's wrong with me, why can't I eat it? ' She just couldn't understand why she couldn't do it. At its worst, she would be having Yorkshire puddings almost every night.\" She added: \"I'd always have a pack of Aunt Bessie's in the freezer or I'd make my own. It was always a nightmare going out for dinners. I tended to stick to the same places. \"When we went for a carvery I explained to the staff that she would only eat Yorkshire puddings. We'd pay £1 and she could have as many as she wanted.\" (Image: No credit) Gemma first noted something was wrong during Covid and began researching her options before she started hypnotherapy. Just months after completing her treatment Tallulah now enjoys healthy salads and roast dinners with all the trimmings. Tallulah shared: \"I only really liked beige foods and Yorkshire puddings were my absolute favourite.\" \"I just couldn't get enough of them. I still like them but I want to try different foods too. Now I like peppers and noodles, curry nuts and dried fruit. I've tried boiled eggs and fried eggs too.\" On working with Tallulah, hypnotherapist David who practices in Coventry and London's Harley Street said: \"Tallulah has been a dream to work with.\" \"She has really taken well to the hypnosis, immediately eating interesting and healthy foods, now no longer showing any signs of ARFID with a free eating, varied and balanced diet, I'm honoured to have worked with her.\"",

        "description": "Households have not been forgotten for energy upgrades, the federal government insists, but they have not received a cent from $1 billion allocated in 2023.",
        "content": "The $1 billion allocated to Australia's green bank for household energy upgrades is yet to reach a single home, a senate budget hearing has been told. Parliamentary hearings examining the 2024/25 budget on Tuesday instead found no spending from a fund established in 2023 to help Australians save money on power bills. The fund was set up to provide discounted consumer finance for energy efficiency upgrades, new appliances and battery-ready solar panels. Assistant Minister for Energy Jenny McAllister said the Clean Energy Finance Corporation has been looking for financing partners and has received a \"very enthusiastic response\" from the market. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. When finalised, the \"co-financiers\" will provide discounted loans directly to consumers. Some $300 million has gone to states to develop energy upgrades for public housing, and local council applications have closed for $100 million for sports grounds and other facilities, she told a senate estimates committee. Quizzed by independent senator David Pocock about how much had actually gone out the door, officials were unable to say how much of the state monies had been spent. \"People around this table can afford to have solar, potentially a battery, induction cook stove, drive an EV and you're basically not paying anything for energy,\" he told the environment committee. \"People who can't afford that are getting absolutely slammed for energy bills and paying international prices for our gas,\" Senator Pocock said. Meanwhile, the United States in April launched a \"solar for all\" program that will roll out rooftop panels for nearly one million low-income households as part of a US$US7 billion ($A11 billion) program. \"I'd love to see urgency around helping households with the transition, because people want to do it,\" Senator Pocock said. The $300 rebate for energy bills would be better spent on getting people off expensive power, he said. Senator McAllister said energy efficiency was a fledgling industry that the federal government was starting from scratch, and the energy rebate was an important cost of living measure.",

        "content": "MANY people return from holiday with dreams of packing in the day job, but these two friends made it a reality after a trip to Mexico. Sick of working for others, Alice Parmiter, 29, and Wynter Karo, 28 decided to launch Pimentae - and the ready-made tequila cocktail business started in their kitchen now turns over six figures. But it hasn't been easy, wanting to get away from the corporate 9-5, the pair used all of their savings and even risked losing it all to get to where they are now. The pair decided to go into business together after trying the best tequilas in Mexico while backpacking the region after meeting at Leeds University. They started the company with £20k back in 2021, cash they'd saved over years of working in their day jobs, and now they've made just shy of £1 million. We both got very, very itchy feet and were like this isn’t for us After university, the pair lived in Wandsworth where Alice took a job working at Asos, and Wynter in Sky Media, but neither had even thought of Pimentae at that point - so they focused on climbing the corporate ladder. \"We both got very, very itchy feet and were like this isn’t for us,” Alice says exclusively to Fabulous for our Bossing It series. \"We’d both been taught that the traditional path is to graduate from uni, go into your grad scheme, climb up the corporate ladder which sadly everyone at university is told is the way for success.” \"It was very much like 'here at the top four, if you don't get a grad scheme, that's not a fantastic thing for you.' “Which is why it's so ironic that we ended up running our own startup, but I guess sometimes it's equally as important to know what you don't like as well as what you do like.\" The pair put their savings together, and also needed money to live, so ran the company alongside their jobs for six months. \"We never knew if it would really take off or not as it was on the edge of lockdown,\" explains Alice. But lockdown might have been their lucky break, with no one able to go to pubs, there was a rise in people buying pre-made cocktails to enjoy at home, plus the pair were able to work from home giving them more free time to work on the launch. “It’s what allowed us to take off so quickly,” says Wynter, “I’m not sure if we would have had the time to it if we weren’t in lockdown.” The co-founders revealed on social media that many people didn't believe in their business at the start, writing ' starting your own cocktail brand won't work' - but they proved them wrong. Despite no experience in bartending, the pair knew a good margarita when they tasted one and perfected the recipe before sending packages out to influencers and celebrities. The pair then went around London during their launch - dropping off packages themselves to 30 influencers in the hopes one or two would post it online. But to their excitement, every single influencer posted the package on social media praising the margaritas. And it's not just influencers who love their products, celebs do to. Michelle Keegan 's makeup artist told Pimentae: \"Me and Michelle were literally messaging this morning because she’s back from Australia next week and how we’re going to make tapas and have picantes when we catch up. \"The last time we made them I was squeezing limes for what felt like forever, my hands were burning. \"The Pimentae Chilli Marg is life changing, honestly one of the nicest I’ve ever had. Definitely ordering some in for the festive season.\" After handing her a bottle, Michelle put the brand on her Instagram stories with the caption ‘Emmy Clarkson (MUA) turning up with the goods today’. Conor Maynard, Luiza Zissman, Sarah Ashcroft, Maya Jama , and Jessie Ware have also praised the brand. The initial £20,000 investment paid for the website, bottles, labels, liquid, manufacturing, production, postage, and influencer packages. The pair made use of free rent for business operations and getting the recipe down by putting them together in their own kitchen in their South London flat. “Wynter and I travelled to Mexico together, and tried lots of high quality tequilas, a lot of people don't understand the history or culture of it, it’s a protected spirit like Champagne, the process behind it is an incredible craft,\" says Alice. “People love a margarita - but there was no way to buy it in a bottle.” And it seemed like their idea has well and truly paid off at the right time, with Tequila being the fastest growing global spirit category at the moment. It was make or break, it was like all of our Christmases came at once But as with any business venture, there were times the girls weren't sure if the business would make it. The pair decided to take a massive risk and hired out a bar at a festival. But the pitch fee was £25k - more than what they had in the bank - so they took out a loan to help pay for it. “It was make or break, it was like all of our Christmases came at once, thousands of people came to the bar,” says Wynter and they managed to make £50,000 in one weekend. “Off the back of that we could quit our jobs,” and it led to their first investor reaching out six months after launching. Both were eager to get out of their office jobs and ditch the rat race , Wynter explains: “There was such little variety, we were all employed to do our own thing and a lot of bureaucracy. “Only 5% of my brain capacity was being used, but for me it was boring, I needed more risk.” Meanwhile, Alice hated \"the lack of creative freedom\" in her industry. \"I worked with the most talented people but lots of ideas just didn't go ahead, it was really demotivating,\" she says. “Running your own business there’s so much freedom, even with a little amount of money, the reward you get from that is incredible.” The Tequila used in Pimentae is from El Tequileño, one of only 8 brands of tequila that is exclusively made at its own distillery and family run for 60 years. Limes for the cocktails are also shipped in from Mexico. Now Pimentea can be found in Selfridges, Waitrose and Fenwick or on their online shop.",

        "content": "It was the last of the Britain's Got Talent auditions over the weekend, and plenty of rules were broken when it came to the coveted golden buzzers. The judges have used their golden buzzers more than once over the course of the season, which for many has been a delight. But there was one act who the audience desperately wanted to received a golden buzzer, but there were none left! So, what happened? As is the case each year, the winner of the season will walk away with a life-changing £250,000 and will perform at the Royal Variety Performance - so the pressure really is on for all of the acts to make their mark. But who are the golden buzzer acts on Britain's Got Talent 2024 ? Here are the contestants who have been revealed so far. Taryn Charles Taryn Charles dazzled the audience and judges during her audition, choosing to sing her own rendition of Aretha Franklin's iconic song (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman. The special educational needs teacher said she wanted to audition because she loves to “make people smile” and she certainly did. The teacher revealed that one of her students had come to support her and after being given the golden buzzer, they joined her on stage to congratulate her along with Bruno Tonioli. Tonioli said of her performance: “You made me forget about [Aretha Franklin's] version. You made it so much your own, with so much feeling, and the colour of your voice is unique and you’re a very, very special person my darling.” Head judge Simon Cowell said he could tell Taryn was nervous because someone must have told her she wasn't good enough in the past, which she admitted was true. Cowell said: “Boy, did you prove that person wrong and that is what that golden buzzer is all about, you are a little star.” CyberAgent Legit Futuristic dance troupe CyberAgent Legit took to the stage wearing coordinated red and silver outfits, and blew the judges and the audience away. All four judges gave them a standing ovation, and Simon even seemed somewhat lost for words. He said after the performance: \"Amazing, fantastic. That was my favourite act of the day, actually. Really, really good, wow.\" The audience started chanting for Simon to press the Golden Buzzer and as Bruno started giving his verdict, Simon reached across and did just that, securing CyberAgent Legit's place in the semi-finals. Simon went up on stage to congratulate them, saying: \"The energy from the audience was just fantastic. I'm so happy for you.\" He added later: \"I could see how much time had gone into that. Everyone in this theatre was rooting for you.\" Sydnie Christmas The judges were originally unsure about Sydnie's performance when she revealed she would be singing Tomorrow from Annie, with Simon admitting it was his least favourite song, but they were soon blown away. Her rendition had the audience up on their feet giving her a standing ovation, along with the whole judging panel – even Simon! Before pressing the golden buzzer, Amanda told Sydnie: \"That was the best version I have ever heard in my life so that's why I'm gonna do this!\" As for why she pressed the golden buzzer, Amanda told RadioTimes.com and other press: \"What beautiful girl! For me, to have the sort of vibes of Adele in that she had that sort of humble, that sense of humour. I said to Simon, 'She was a clown.' But you could see it meant so much to her on the day.\" As Amanda went to give her a hug, Sydnie said: \"Thank you for this opportunity.\" Ssaulabi Taekwondo Troupe Hailing from South Korea is the Ssaulabi Taekwondo Troupe, who impressed the judges and audience alike with their stunt-filled performance. The group want to the be the first Taekwondo troupe to win Britain's Got Talent, and Ant and Dec's golden buzzer pushed them closer to that chance! As their performance came to an end, the audience and judges were up on their feet and soon, Ant and Dec made their way down and hit the golden buzzer. Ravi's Dream Team It was an emotional one when Ravi and his choir sang for the judges in the latest episode of Britain's Got Talent. As Ravi stepped on stage with his friends and family, he told the judges he was living with a brain tumour and has \"always\" wanted to audition for BGT. \"Two yeas ago I was diagnosed with a brain tumour and I'm here to show no matter what life throws, you can still achieve your dreams,\" he told the judges. Ravi and the choir then performed A Million Dreams from The Greatest Showman, and there wasn't a dry eye to be seen. As they came to the end of their performance, Alesha Dixon pressed the coveted golden buzzer. As for why she pressed the buzzer, Dixon said: \"The golden buzzer is such a personal thing and I always say I can only press it when it feels right, and you're such a remarkable young man.\" Nabe Comedian Nabe had the entire audience and each of the judges in stitches with his eccentric impressions - but none more so than Amanda Holden, who pressed her golden buzzer for a second time to send the jokester to the semi-finals. Speaking of her decision, Holden said: \"Normally when I press my golden buzzer, I'm in floods of tears and I give a big speech, but this made me howl, you were so funny.\" Phoenix Boys Bringing the laughs may have worked for Nabe, but Phoenix Boys got through by bringing the emotions for Bruno Tonioli. The dance troupe managed to leave the former Strictly Come Dancing judge in tears - and he got so excited to send them through that he broke his golden buzzer! \"What really touches people is when you perform from your heart,\" Tonioli explained. \"It's the truth of your performance, that's really what remains in people’s minds - and you touched me, and I think you touched everyone here.\" Haribow Haribow became the last act to received a golden buzzer - and this time, it was courtesy of someone other than the judges. The dance troupe, who flew in from Japan, impressed the judges and viewers alike, with those in the audience begging the panel to give them a golden buzzer, but there was nothing they could do as there were none left to give out! \"This is better than anything I've ever seen, and you are amazing dancers as well,\" Bruno said as he turned to the shouting audience. \"Listen to me, we've got none left, we can't!\" As the crowd's screams became more intense, Simon told his son Eric and Amanda's daughter Hollie to \"do it\", and they hit the golden buzzer! \"What an amazing moment, that was my son and Amanda's daughter, egged on by the audience,\" Simon said. \"We are going to see you in the finals - congratulations.\" We'll be updating this page regularly with all the golden buzzer acts from Britain's Got Talent 2024.

        "content": "On Tuesday, Mizuho Securities expressed a more optimistic outlook on Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NYSE: NCLH ), upgrading the stock from a Neutral to a Buy rating and increasing the price target to $24 from the previous $21. This adjustment reflects a growing positive sentiment toward the company, which had been predominantly viewed with skepticism over the past two years. The firm cited several factors contributing to the upgraded stance on Norwegian Cruise Line. A favorable industry supply backdrop marked by a low single-digit percentage annual increase is expected to bolster the company's earnings. Additionally, Norwegian Cruise Line's specific initiatives to control costs are seen as a positive move. Norwegian Cruise Line's strategic reorganization of itineraries is anticipated to improve yields and operating leverage more than previously expected. This repositioning is part of the company's efforts to enhance its financial performance and offer greater value to its shareholders. The analyst's comments underscore the shift in market sentiment, suggesting that the previous consensus short position on Norwegian Cruise Line may be waning. The combination of industry dynamics and company-specific strategies is believed to provide a solid foundation for Norwegian Cruise Line's future growth. Investors and market watchers can now observe how Norwegian Cruise Line's stock will perform following Mizuho's upgraded rating and increased price target, as well as how the company's operational adjustments will translate into financial results. InvestingPro Insights In light of Mizuho Securities' optimistic outlook on Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NYSE:NCLH), current InvestingPro data and tips provide a deeper insight into the company's financial health and market position. With a market capitalization of $6.86 billion and a P/E ratio of 19.76, the company presents an interesting case for investors. Notably, Norwegian Cruise Line has shown a robust revenue growth of 45.17% over the last twelve months as of Q1 2024, indicating significant recovery and potential for future earnings. InvestingPro Tips suggest that while Norwegian Cruise Line operates with a significant debt burden, analysts have a positive outlook with net income expected to grow this year. In fact, 8 analysts have revised their earnings upwards for the upcoming period, and the company is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth, which could signal an attractive investment opportunity. However, it's important to be aware of the stock's volatility and the fact that short-term obligations exceed liquid assets.

        "content": "Before moving to another country, the question often arises, \"Where will I feel most comfortable?\" and the answer is that Zurich, Switzerland , is the place to go. This city is one of the happiest in Europe due to its well-developed infrastructure, high level of security, high-quality medical care and a wide range of opportunities for professional growth. According to the EU Special Commission, this settlement can be an ideal place for comfortable living and opening new horizons. Express reports that responses from 83 European cities were taken into account. Zurich has been recognized as the best place to live on the continent. An impressive 97% of people said they feel happy living in this city. The Scots were satisfied with the areas of work, public transportation, healthcare and air quality. Zurich's public transportation system includes trams, buses, boats, and trains. Moreover, Switzerland has the third largest public transportation system in the world. Despite all the positive aspects, Zurich still has one disadvantage: the unavailability of housing. The issue concerns high real estate prices, which is inconvenient for many people. Therefore, it cannot be considered an ideal city, although it is the most comfortable of all in Europe. Last year, Zurich was recognized as the most friendly city on the continent. The rating was based on several factors, from crime rates to tolerance of LGBTQ+ people. This city in northern Switzerland received a perfect AAA rating for its acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community, high happiness rating, and low crime rate. Among other countries, the top 10 best places to live in Europe also include: Earlier, OBOZ.UA wrote that New York became the richest city in the world. It turned out that every 24th resident is a millionaire. Only verified information is available on the OBOZ.UA Telegram channel and Viber . Do not fall for fakes!",

        "content": "Loading... Loading... An upcoming version of Microsoft Corp.'s Phone Link app for Windows 11 users will add the ability to select and copy text from images synced from Android phones. The feature, currently in beta testing, is expected to be widely available soon. What Happened : According to a report by The Verge, the new feature is an upgrade to Microsoft's Phone Link, formerly known as Link to Windows on the phone side. The app allows the synchronization of calls, messages, notifications, and images from Android phones to Windows computers. See Also: Elon Musk Is In A ‘League Of His Own,’ Says Steve Jobs And Tesla CEO’s Biographer: ‘He’s A Serial Tasker’ This comes after Microsoft updated the Windows Snipping Tool with a text extraction feature, allowing users to extract text from phone photos. The latest update streamlines this process by enabling in-app text extraction. Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. The report adds that the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology performed well enough, although it made more errors than Samsung or Apple’s text extractors when used on the same photo of a book page.

        "content": "has taken to his official X account to that upcoming opponent suffered a during a flight, which led to paramedics being needed on the aircraft. Tyson was flying from Miami to Los Angeles when his ulcer flared up and paramedics boarded to treat the 57-year-old. Following the news breaking about the 57-year-old's health scare, social media posts from KSI and Dillon Danis about the upcoming fight prompted a response from Jake Paul himself, who accused everyone of making stuff up before knowing the full severity of the situation, going on to say that nothing has changed in regard to the fight on the 20th of July. \"You love to make s*** up before knowing the facts for clicks/likes. Nothing changed.\" The 57-year-old's representatives confirmed that the former heavyweight champion is \"doing great\" after his health scare. The posts from the accounts of KSI and Danis led many to believe that the fight between the two in July would not go ahead, something which was quickly shut down by Paul's post. Come fight night, it will be 6,979 days since Mike Tyson's last professional boxing match. However, from the statement sent to the New York Post on Monday, Tyson appears to be doing well, as his representatives clarified the situation, explaining that the 57-year-old became dizzy and nauseous before landing, and that he was thankful for the health care he received. Tyson's team also went on to deny reports that the health emergency had caused his flight to be delayed. Reports suggested that other passengers were delayed from disembarking the flight for an additional 25 minutes, but it seems like that was not the case. The two are set to face off in the ring in July in what has been listed as a heavyweight contest by the Texas Department of Licensing & Regulations. The former YouTuber will meet the former heavyweight champion in Dallas, and the fight will be streamed on Netflix, which has taken a step into the sports streaming world, most recently acquiring rights to WWE television beginning in January. After beginning his career as a YouTube prankster and a Disney star, Paul made his boxing debut back in 2020, initially sharing the ring with fellow YouTubers. Since then, however, The Problem Child has gone on to win nine fights, coming up against opponents such as UFC icon Nate Diaz. Of his nine wins, Paul has won six via knockout. His sole loss against Tommy Fury, however, came via split decision. The 57-year-old enjoyed a glittering career over 20 years, between 1985 and 2005. However, his days in the ring were not short of controversy. His most famous moment is also perhaps one of the most infamous in sporting history, when he crazily decided to bite the ear of Evander Holyfield. 58 10 50 9 6 1 0 0 2 0 His fight with Paul in July will be his first professional bout since he retired in 2005. However, he has been in the ring since then, taking on another former world champion, Roy Jones Jr in 2020 in an exhibition bout. That fight resulted in a draw, but ahead of Tyson's meeting with Paul, Jones has heaped praise on the power that the 57-year-old still possesses, a quality many have warned the 27-year-old about before he underestimates the former heavyweight champion.",

        "description": "Plowing $9 billion into a manufacturing facility could help a successful tirzepatide launch reach new heights.",
        "content": "Eli Lilly ( LLY -0.13% ) stock is already up by about 90% over the past year, and it could climb even higher. BMO Capital analyst Evan Seigerman recently raised his price target to $1,001 per share, which implies a gain of about 24% from recent prices. Seigerman recently noted that soaring demand for Eli Lilly's weight management drug, Zepbound, is outpacing supply. The company plans to improve on the current supply shortage, which could benefit Lilly investors in more ways than one. Before pouncing on Eli Lilly shares, it's important to remember that sell-side analysts will quietly adjust their attention-getting price targets downward if their predictions don't come true. Repairing the damage a missed call can cause your portfolio isn't so easy. Here's a closer look at Eli Lilly to see if it could be right for you. Why Lilly's plowing $9 billion into a tirzepatide manufacturing site Tirzepatide is the active ingredient in Eli Lilly's type-2 diabetes treatment, Mounjaro, and its weight management drug, Zepbound. Last year Lilly committed $3.7 billion to a manufacturing site in Indiana that produces the active ingredient. Recently it raised that commitment by $5.3 billion to $9 billion. Mounjaro first earned approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2022, and Zepbound followed last November. The sales explosion these drugs have produced is unprecedented. Combined sales shot up to $2.3 billion during the first three months of the year, and demand is so high that some Wall Street analysts have predicted tirzepatide sales of more than $50 billion annually at its peak. Tirzepatide's launch has been incredibly successful, but sales would be much higher if Eli Lilly could keep up with demand. This isn't the only reason the company is racing to boost manufacturing. Compounding pharmacies are eating Lilly's lunch and weakening the Zepbound brand. There are a lot of ins and outs regarding drug shortages and state-licensed compounding pharmacies. Generally, the FDA allows them to make and distribute their own versions of patent-protected drugs during a shortage. Compounded drugs aren't necessarily dangerous, but the risk of receiving the wrong dosage and related issues is significantly greater. At the moment, the starting dosage of tirzepatide is available. However, the FDA currently allows licensed compounding pharmacies to produce larger maintenance dosages due to limited availability. Folks who want to lose weight don't have to wait for an appointment with their primary care physician, either. Hims & Hers Health , a mail-order pharmacy business with over $1 billion in annual sales, recently began offering compounded versions of tirzepatide and semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy from Novo Nordisk . Eli Lilly's enormous investment in its tirzepatide facility could quickly end the ongoing shortage and help it catch up with its top competitor in the weight management arena. In February, Novo Nordisk struck up an $11 billion deal to acquire Catalent and its U.S. manufacturing facilities. A buy now? Eli Lilly reported a $6.1 billion profit over the past 12 months, and the stock market expects this figure to rocket higher for several more years. The stock has been trading at the nosebleed-inducing multiple of about 59 times forward-looking earnings estimates. If tirzepatide sales climb to $50 billion, investors who've bought Lilly stock at recent or current prices could realize market-beating gains over the long run. That said, it's a risky stock to buy at such an elevated earnings multiple. If tirzepatide sales can't keep rocketing higher for some unforeseen reason, those investors could suffer heavy losses. I wouldn't bet against Eli Lilly stock rising to new heights, but it looks too risky at its elevated valuation for most investors.",

        "content": "The Department for Work and Pensions is set to axe a benefit claimed by an eye-watering 730,000 people. The DWP will shunt people on legacy benefits onto Universal Credit as part of the widespread 'managed migration' process. It means Tax Credits will be phased out from next year, with claimants moved onto the one-size-fits-all system. The regulation, which is set to come into effect next year, will end all Tax Credit claims from April 6, 2025. The documents state: \"Regulation 8 is designed to prevent any renewal of existing Tax Credit claims or allow a person who is claiming one tax credit (for example Working Tax Credit), to claim the other Tax Credit (Child Tax Credit), and vice versa. READ MORE Brits in Spain and Portugal told to prepare for 'dramatic' shift starting today \"This will also ensure there are no Tax Credits claims from April 2025. Regulation 6A of the Universal Credit (Transitional Provisions) Regulations 2014 states that a person cannot make a claim to a Tax Credit. However, exceptions are provided in Regulation 6A(6) for existing Tax Credit claimants to claim the other Tax Credit and (7) for existing Tax Credit claimants to apply to renew their awards. \"These exceptions are now removed – so there can be no more claims to a Tax Credit. This regulation does not come into force until 06/04/2025\" Tax Credits, despite the name, are benefit payments to support people with children or who are in work but on low incomes. There are two types of Tax Credits: Child Tax Credit, which is for people with children, whether working or not. Eligibility depends on how many children you have and the number of hours you work, and also Working Tax Credit, which is for people who work, but are on low income (doesn't matter if you've got kids or not). The amount you get depends on a number of factors: including your income, whether you're single or in a couple, when your children were born, your working hours and also whether you've a disability.",

        "content": "Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged lower in early European trade Tuesday on a slight pickup on risk sentiment, but traded in tight ranges ahead of the release of key inflation data. At 04:25 ET (08:25 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% lower at 104.410, handing back some of last week’s strong gains as traders returned from the holidays in the U.K. and the U.S.. Dollar slips ahead of core PCE release The dollar slipped slightly Tuesday, but trading ranges remain tight ahead of Friday’s release of the U.S. core personal consumption expenditures price index report - the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation. The outlook for U.S. rates has been the dominant driver of currency moves of late, and traders will be looking for further guidance of the pace and scale of rate cuts expected this year. Expectations are for the core PCE index to hold largely steady on a monthly basis, and comes as markets are becoming resigned to the higher-for-longer interest rate narrative after last week's Fed minutes, along with cautious sounding remarks from a number of policymakers. Investors will also get the chance to hear from several Fed speakers during the week including Governor Michelle Bowman , Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester , Governor Lisa Cook , New York Fed President John Williams and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic . The economic calendar also features revised data on first quarter economic growth on Thursday and the Fed’s Beige Book on Wednesday. Euro gains ahead of CPI release In Europe, EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher to 1.0872, gaining ahead of key eurozone consumer inflation data, due at the end of the week. The European Central Bank is preparing for an interest rate cut next week, with policymakers largely confirming this with dovish comments on Monday. The ECB has plenty of room for rate cuts and current market expectations for easing over the long-run are reasonable, ECB policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said in a newspaper interview on Monday, describing a cut next month as a \"done deal\". Uncertainty over what happens next exists, and Friday’s CPI release will be watched for guidance. Economists expect eurozone inflation to tick up 2.5% in May year-on-year, from 2.4% in April, while underlying inflation is seen holding steady at 2.7%. GBP/USD edged higher to 1.2770, with the U.K. economic calendar quiet as the election campaign gets under way. “There will be some interest in any campaign pledges by Labour Party leader Keir Starmer (who leads in the polls by a wide margin). He kicked off the campaign with a speech yesterday which has, however, had little market resonance,” said analysts at ING, in a note. Yen remains under pressure In Asia, USD/JPY edged higher to 156.89, remaining close to recent highs as apparent currency market intervention by the government, at the beginning of May, provided only fleeting relief to the yen. CPI data from Tokyo is due this Friday and is likely to factor into the Bank of Japan’s outlook on interest rates. USD/CNY traded 0.1% higher at 7.2471, with the pair still close to six-month highs, amid creeping doubts over a Chinese economic recovery. Key Chinese purchasing managers index data is also on tap this week.",

        "content": "Joshua Roberts The Federal Reserve should see more positive inflation data before it can consider cutting interest rates, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari told CNBC on Tuesday. \"Many more months of positive inflation data, I think, to give me confidence that it's appropriate to dial back,\" he said, adding that rate hikes could be on the table if inflation does not cool further. \"I don't think we should rule anything out at this point,\" Kashkari said . Earlier this month, the Fed official had said the central bank may need to maintain rates at the current level for \"a while longer,\" potentially even all year. Kashkari's views echo those of his colleagues, who also want to see more positive inflation data before they can support rate cuts.

        "content": "THIS Morning star Sian Welby shared she was forced to wee on the side of the A3 after being trapped in horrendous traffic across the weekend. The TV and radio presenter , who is 37 weeks pregnant, found herself caught up in a horrendous motorway jam that tailed back over four hours. Speaking of the Bank Holiday ordeal on This Morning on Monday, Sian admitted she was forced to rush into brambles on the road to relieve herself after three-and-a-half hours with little movement. \"I had to do a wee in the middle of the road,” she said. “I had to run into the bush and I didn't dare go in there as it was full of brambles and nettles.\" The person she was driving with captured the hilarious moment on camera, with Sian darting to try and find some privacy so she could wee. Dermot O’Leary, Josie Gibson and Giles Brandreth broke out into laughter at the scenes, with Giles saying: “Is this you coming back from your wee? Now I've seen it all. “Morning television isn't what it used to be, is it?” “The mystique is definitely gone,” Dermot added. “But who doesn't love a pee-pee rustique from time to time?\" This prompted Sian to admit: \"Do you know what? It was exhilarating.\" Sian had tracked the journey on Instagram on Sunday afternoon and evening, with the traffic taking almost five hours to clear. In another kick in the teeth, the reported roadworks hadn’t even seemingly occurred – with a row of traffic cones causing the chaos that brought the motorway to a standstill. Sian is weeks away from giving birth to her first child, announcing her pregnancy in February on Capital Radio after keeping it secret for months. Even her co-hosts Roman Kemp and Chris Stark seemed out of the know, with Sian admitting she was drinking mocktails at the Christmas party in December to hide it from everyone. This is her first baby with radio producer Jake Beckett , who proposed last summer. She's since been using her platform to get advice from other mums - with pop star and mum-of-two Meghan Trainor even predicting what she'll have. As Sian stood up to show off her baby bump to Meghan who was on a live link from her LA home, the singer said confidently: \"I think it is a girl! \"She looks like she is carrying high up, I love it!\"",

        "description": "I tried Amazon’s microcurrent jawline exercise tool to improve my profile and tighten my neck. Read my review of Amazon’s neck and face massaging device to find out what happened.",
        "content": "Neck firming creams and serums should be part of your daily beauty routine, and they have been a part of mine for years. Admittedly, not used as religiously used as my skincare but as I’ve aged, I’ve noticed that that part of my body is a little more, shall we say, saggy, and lined than it used to be. And while neck firming lotions and products have their place, I jumped on the at-home beauty tool train and invested in Amazon’s Electric Neck and Face Lift Massager, designed to iron out neck lines and tighten the skin around the jaw and neck. Think of it as a PT for your jawline. Using microcurrents and light therapy, including red, blue and purple light, this handheld device promised to lift, firm and smooth the skin in just 10 minutes a day. Retailing for / , did it live up to my expectations? The small tool fit comfortably into my hand and a quick charge of the battery, via USB, and it was ready to roll. Easy to use, there’s one button to select the type of light therapy you want and apply to the skin. £28.88 at Amazon $29.99 at Amazon It’s recommended you apply an oil, serum or moisturiser before using, and I applied my usual to the neck (but you can use any moisturising product) before delving in. The microcurrent kicks in once its pressed against your skin, and it has a pleasant warming feel. I focused on my neck and jawline, and started by smoothing the tool upwards of my neck towards my jaw. It literally felt like I was ironing out wrinkles, and I soon fell into a rhythm of moving it not too fast, and not too slow. There’s no instructions or guide on how to use it best for your intended results, and I suggest a quick YouTube search if you need some advice. If all else fails for the neck, my years of experience in the beauty field is to always massage up the neck – you want lifting, not dragging the skin down. After 10 minutes, I moved to the jaw, angling the device onto my jawline and smoothing it out towards my ears. Again, it actually feels quite pleasant and I did it while watching – 10 minutes soon passed! As with everything in beauty, consistency is key and I kept up the routine for a good seven days. By day three, I actually felt a slight ache in my neck and jawline, as if I’d done hundreds of face yoga exercises or had an intense facial massage. Now, I’m not going to tell you that suddenly I was as snatched as Bella Hadid with the neck of a 21 year old (I’m 41, let’s keep it real here) but what I can tell you is, that I did see a difference and I was pretty impressed, considering the price of the beauty tool and how easy it was to do. The biggest improvement I saw was my jawline. My burgeoning double chin looked less burgeoning, and while inches weren’t taken off, it looked firmer and more toned. My jawline, which in recent years has softened a little, looked sharper – not razor sharp, but a little more defined that it had looked a week before. Strangely, using the neck toning tool has had an effect on the way I hold my neck too. It feels as though it has re-trained it, and instead of holding my chin down somewhat (and causing a double chin), I hold it more up and straight – immediately giving me less of a squishy chin and much more swan-like neck vibes. Is it worth the money? I think so. I’ve used it on and off now, over the last month, and have continued to see improvements, especially in the lines on my neck. I’ve started moving it towards the decolletage too, to sort crepey skin there. If anything, it’s made me more conscious of remembering to apply neck and decolletage cream, even if I don’t then use the device. Fellow Amazon shoppers seem to agree with me, with multiple reviews praising how easy it is to use and good value for money. “The skin does look smoother and more toned,” one wrote with another echoing that sentiment. “A cracking way to help define the skin on your neck without the cost of those beauty parlours out there.” By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!

        "content": "BERLIN - Germany granted citizenship to a record number of people last year, due largely to a jump in the number of Syrians who qualified for a passport after fleeing their country around a decade ago, the Federal Statistics Office said on Tuesday. Overall, some 200,100 foreigners were naturalised last year, a 19% rise from the previous year and the highest level since records started in 2000. Around 38% of those people came from Syria, with Turkish and Iraqi citizens making up the next biggest group. \"The high number of naturalisations of Syrians is linked to the high influx of Syrian asylum seekers between 2014 and 2016 who are increasingly meeting naturalisation requirements, such as language skills and minimum residence time,\" said the Office. In addition, spouses and minors can be naturalised without a minimum period of residence. The newly naturalised Germans were on average 29.3 years old, compared to the average of 44.6 years old in the overall population. Many economists argue that the integration of younger migrants in the workforce will help tackle the time-bomb of an ageing population in Europe's biggest economy. REUTERS",

        "content": "The $1 billion allocated to Australia’s green bank for household energy upgrades is yet to reach a single home, a senate budget hearing has been told. Parliamentary hearings examining the 2024/25 budget on Tuesday instead found no spending from a fund established in 2023 to help Australians save money on power bills. The fund was set up to provide discounted consumer finance for energy efficiency upgrades, new appliances and battery-ready solar panels. Assistant Minister for Energy Jenny McAllister said the Clean Energy Finance Corporation has been looking for financing partners and has received a “very enthusiastic response” from the market. When finalised, the “co-financiers” will provide discounted loans directly to consumers. Some $300 million has gone to states to develop energy upgrades for public housing, and local council applications have closed for $100 million for sports grounds and other facilities, she told a senate estimates committee. Quizzed by independent senator David Pocock about how much had actually gone out the door, officials were unable to say how much of the state monies had been spent. “People around this table can afford to have solar, potentially a battery, induction cook stove, drive an EV and you’re basically not paying anything for energy,” he told the environment committee. “People who can’t afford that are getting absolutely slammed for energy bills and paying international prices for our gas,” Senator Pocock said. Meanwhile, the United States in April launched a “solar for all” program that will roll out rooftop panels for nearly one million low-income households as part of a US$US7 billion ($A11 billion) program. “I’d love to see urgency around helping households with the transition, because people want to do it,” Senator Pocock said. The $300 rebate for energy bills would be better spent on getting people off expensive power, he said. Senator McAllister said energy efficiency was a fledgling industry that the federal government was starting from scratch, and the energy rebate was an important cost of living measure.",

        "description": "With his current deal at Kaizer Chiefs set to expire at the end of June and his future uncertain, midfielder Siyethemba Sithebe is understood to have no shortage of suitors.",
        "content": "Amakhosi ended the season in disappointing fashion with a 2-0 defeat to relegated Cape Town Spurs. The loss sees them end 10th on the DStv Premiership log table, their lowest finish in the PSL era. | With a new coach confirmed to be joining the team next season and an extensive overhaul expected in both player and technical team personnel, Sithebe is one of the players at risk of heading for the exit door. Although this website has it on good authority that the dreadlocked midfielder’s fate at Chiefs is yet to be decided, has also established that the former AmaZulu FC man is not short of admirers. Particularly in KZN, where Lamontville Golden Arrows are rebuilding a competitive squad. Although 31, Sithebe would still bring reasonable steel and experience in Steve Komphela’s midfield and is understood to be one of the players the Durban outfit is looking to pounce on. | Arrows were initially interested in Sithebe in January but seemingly cooled off their interest. Fresh information reaching this publication is that Abafana Bes’thende have kept the door open on roping in Sithebe on a free should Amakhosi opt against a new deal. \"No, no they (Arrows) still like him. Obviously it all depends with what happens at Chiefs; if he gets a new offer and agrees to a new deal ad things like that,\" a source revealed. Sithebe has made 11 appearances this season, 10 of which came in the last 10 matches and his longest run of consecutive matches in a Chiefs shirt.",

        "description": "Nicholas Whitehead's cellmate found him 'slumped over on his side' at HMP Sudbury on January 23, 2020",
        "content": "A father-of-three took a 'lethal mix of hard drugs' and was found dead in his cell - just hours before he was due to be released from prison. Nicholas Whitehead's cellmate found him 'slumped over on his side' at HMP Sudbury on January 23, 2020. The 38-year-old, who was sentenced to five years behind bars for burglary, theft and fraud, had ingested multiple substances, including heroin, cocaine and two psychoactive stimulants. His death prompted Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, Adrian Usher, to question how he was able to express get hold of illicit drugs in prison and express concern that his use of them had gone undetected by staff. The Prison Service has now said it has ramped up drug testing at the prison, located on the Staffordshire-Derbyshire border. It has also hired \"specialist staff to stop illicit drugs from entering the prison\", StokeonTrentLive reports. READ MORE: Teachers lift the lid on 'pretty stressful, almost 24-hour' job they still 'love and find rewarding' A report revealed that Whitehead, from Meir in Staffordshire , had an aneurysm, which had been confirmed by an MRI scan. He'd also been taken to hospital on January 3, 2020, due to a burst gluteal abscess and underwent surgery the next day. He returned to HMP Sudbury 24-hours later, and had been prescribed codeine for pain relief - but there was \"no indication in the health records that he was taking or suspected of taking any illicit substances\". Whitehead had been seen by a prison GP on January 9, 2020, and referred him urgently to a neurosurgeon - although an appointment was not received before he passed away. The report stated: \"Mr Whitehead’s cellmate said in his prison statement that on January 22, Mr Whitehead had had a haircut as he was going to be released on temporary licence the following day. He said that in the evening, they talked about Mr Whitehead’s release and went to bed at around 11pm that night. \"Two officers completed roll checks that night but noted nothing unusual or untoward about Mr Whitehead or his cellmate. An officer said that if she noticed anything unusual, she would have noted it in the wing observation book, which she did not. There was no CCTV footage available.\" The cellmate recalled Whitehead being \"asleep on his back, snoring\" around the time of the midnight roll check, and he'd tried to wake him at 8.20am on January 23 but he was \"slumped over on his side\". He said in his statement he'd \"ran to the wing office to alert prison staff who attended straightaway and called a medical emergency\". Officers and healthcare staff tried to resuscitate Mr Whitehead but he was pronounced dead at 9.08am. The report continued: \"At approximately 9.55am, the family liaison officer and an officer left the prison to visit Mr Whitehead’s mother. On their way, they met Mr Whitehead’s brother who had come to the prison to meet him for his day release. The officers took him into a private room and broke the news of Mr Whitehead’s death. He was concerned about how his mother would take the news, and how it would affect her health. They visited her together and broke the news to her. They offered their condolences and support.\" The report added: \"We are concerned that Mr Whitehead was able to access cocaine, heroin and psychoactive stimulants at Sudbury, and that the prison missed that he was using drugs. There was no intelligence or reported instances that he misused drugs at Sudbury before 23 January, 2020 and there was no indication in his medical records that he was taking or was suspected of taking any illicit substances. \"A cell search was conducted shortly after he died and no illicit substances were found. In the absence of evidence, we cannot say whether or not he misused drugs regularly in prison. Although we recognise that Sudbury has a sound drugs strategy in place, and improvements have been made, Mr Whitehead apparently had no difficulty in obtaining and using drugs without staff becoming aware. \"While we consider that Sudbury has taken positive steps to address the drugs problem and we decided not to make a recommendation in our previous investigation into a drug-related death at the prison because of this, we are concerned that this is now the second death we have seen within an 18-month period, where we have raised concerns about prisoners having access to illicit substances.\" Mr Usher recommended that the governor of HMP Sudbury ensured staff were 'vigilant for signs of substance misuse' and concluded: \"I am concerned that Mr Whitehead was able to access illicit drugs at Sudbury and that the prison missed that he was taking drugs. Although I recognise the progress that Sudbury has made in reducing the level of illicit substances entering the prison, it needs to continue in its efforts to reduce the supply of and demand for illicit substances and staff need to remain vigilant for signs that prisoners are using drugs.\" A Prison Service spokesperson said: “Our thoughts remain with the family of Mr Whitehead. HMP Sudbury has made significant improvements since this incident, including ramping up drug testing and hiring specialist staff to stop illicit drugs from entering the prison.”",

        "content": "The North's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said it launched a spy satellite aboard a new rocket at its main northwestern space center. But KCNA said the rocket blew up during a first-stage flight soon after liftoff due to a suspected engine problem. Seoul : A rocket launched by North Korea to deploy the country’s second spy satellite exploded shortly after lift off Monday, state media reported, in a setback for leader Kim Jong Un’s hopes to field satellites to monitor the US and South Korea. Monday’s failed launch came hours after leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. The launch drew rebukes from the North’s neighbors because the UN bans North Korea from conducting any such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. The North’s official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said it launched a spy satellite aboard a new rocket at its main northwestern space center. But KCNA said the rocket blew up during a first-stage flight soon after liftoff due to a suspected engine problem. KCNA cited the unidentified vice director of the National Aerospace Technology Administration as saying that a preliminary examination showed that the explosion was related to the reliability of operation of the newly developed liquid oxygen-petroleum engine. He said other possible causes will be investigated, according to KCNA. Japan’s government briefly issued a missile warning for the southern prefecture of Okinawa, urging residents to take shelter inside buildings and other safer places. The warning was lifted later because the region was no longer in danger, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said. Earlier Monday, North Korea had notified Japan’s coast guard about its planned launch with a warning to exercise caution in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and China and east of the main Philippine island of Luzon during a launch window from Monday through June 3. North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles. Japanese Defense Minister Minoru Kihara called the North’s launch “a serious challenge to the entire world.” South Korea’s Unification Ministry called a satellite launch by the North “a provocation that seriously threatens our and regional security.” During the trilateral meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Chinese Premier Li Qiang earlier Monday, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol called for stern international action if North Korea went ahead with its launch plan. Kishida, for his part, urged the North to withdraw its launch plan, but Li didn’t mention the launch plan as he offered general comments about promoting peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula through a political resolution. Some observers say that North Korea’s satellite launch on the first day of its eight-day window might have been aimed at casting a chill over the Seoul-Beijing-Tokyo meeting and registering its displeasure with China. Kim Jong Un has been embracing the idea of a “new Cold War” and seeking to boost ties with Beijing and Moscow to forge a united front against Washington, so China’s diplomacy with Seoul and Tokyo might have been a disturbing development for Pyongyang. Kim’s primary focus in recent months has been on Russia, as Pyongyang and Moscow — both locked in confrontations with Washington — expand their military cooperation. China, which is much more sensitive about its international reputation, has joined Russia in blocking US-led efforts at the UN Security Council to tighten sanctions on the North but has been less bold and open about supporting Kim’s “new Cold War” drive. North Korea’s Foreign Ministry on Monday strongly criticized a joint statement issued by Li, Yoon and Kishida, calling them “wanton interference in its internal affairs.” The ministry took issue with parts of the joint statement that said the three leaders re-emphasized their existing positions on the issue of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. While North Korea focused much of its criticism on South Korea for allegedly being chiefly responsible for the statement, it’s still extremely rare for North Korea to slam a statement signed by China. The failed satellite launch is a blow to Kim’s plan to launch three more military spy satellites in 2024 in addition to his country’s first military reconnaissance satellite that was placed in orbit last November. The November launch followed two failed liftoffs. In the first attempt, the North Korean rocket carrying the satellite crashed into the ocean soon after liftoff. After the second attempt, North Korea said there was an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said Monday it detected a launch trajectory believed to be of a spy satellite fired from the North’s main space center at 10:44 pm on Monday. Four minutes later, many fragments were spotted in the waters, it said.",

        "content": "A DERMATOLOGIST has revealed the three most effective ingredients to include in skincare routines for defying the signs of aging. She said beauty products should be used consistently to achieve optimal results. Nancy Wickford is a skincare specialist and dermatologist at the UK-based brand HelloSKIN . Speaking to The U.S. Sun, she shared must-try tips for maintaining a youthful appearance. Wickford said a gentle cleanser, moisturizer, SPF, and occasional exfoliation can benefit skin health at every age. She said hydrogel eye masks target the delicate areas around the eyes, prone to dryness, fine lines, and wrinkles. She suggested HelloSKIN’s Hydrating Hydrogel Eye masks for reducing the appearance of dark circles, puffiness, and crow’s feet. The $16 masks contain hyaluronic acid and the Korean complex Botaniceutical Plus-10. “In the 20s and 30s, hydrogel eye masks can be used as a preventative measure to keep the eye area supple and hydrated,” Wickford said. “In the 40s and beyond, when signs of aging become more apparent, these masks can help to minimize the look of existing fine lines and wrinkles while delivering intense hydration and nourishment to the delicate eye area.” Wickford said patience is necessary when treating fine lines and wrinkles as it can take weeks or months to see results. She warned against using retinoids alongside harsh scrubs as she shared three ingredients that transform aging skin. “Retinoids: These vitamin A derivatives help increase cell turnover and stimulate collagen production,” she said. “Start with a low-concentration retinol serum or cream and gradually increase strength as your skin builds tolerance. “Use at night and follow with a moisturizer. “Hydrating face serum: Look for serums containing hyaluronic acid, which can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water, plumping and hydrating the skin to diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, such as helloSKIN’s Hydration Serum. “Antioxidant serums: Vitamins C and E help neutralize free radicals that contribute to premature aging. “Use a potent antioxidant serum in the morning under sunscreen.” Healthline describes hyaluronic acid as a glycosaminoglycan naturally found in the body's connective tissue. It keeps water molecules on the surfaces of the skin for a hydrated appearance. Hyaluronic acid reduces the appearance of wrinkles and improves wound healing. Wickford said professional salon treatments such as facials should be used alongside home skincare routines rather than as a replacement. “Professional facials can help combat signs of aging by deeply exfoliating, hydrating, and infusing the skin with potent anti-aging ingredients,” she said. “If you’re concerned about wrinkles, age spots, and loss of firmness, getting a facial every 4-6 weeks can be beneficial in maintaining a more youthful, radiant complexion.” The dermatologist said several lifestyle factors can potentially reverse the signs of aging. These include regular exercise for flexibility, cardiovascular health, and improved muscle tone. Also, quitting smoking, protecting the skin from sun exposure, and maintaining a healthy weight. “A balanced, nutrient-rich diet high in antioxidants from fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats can combat oxidative stress and inflammation linked to aging,” she said. “Adequate sleep, stress management through practices like meditation or yoga, and staying socially engaged can also positively impact physical and cognitive function.” * If you click on a link in this boxout we may earn affiliate revenue Hydrating Hydrogel Eye masks, $16, HelloSKIN Hydration Serum, $27, HelloSKIN Wickford said three popular anti-aging hacks on social media should be avoided as they lack scientific evidence and could be harmful. “While vitamin C is beneficial for anti-aging, using undiluted lemon juice can cause severe irritation, dryness, and sometimes chemical burns on the skin due to its low pH level,” she said. “Some people claim that the hydrocortisone in hemorrhoid creams can reduce puffiness and wrinkles around the eyes. “However, I’d always suggest avoiding using them under your eyes these creams are not formulated for the delicate eye area and can cause severe irritation, thinning of the skin, and other side effects.” She also advised against DIY dermaplanning to remove dead skin cells and peach fuzz. “Attempting this at home with improper tools or technique can lead to cuts, scarring, and infection, please always leave this to a professional,” she said.",

        "content": "A clip of former Soweto Gospel Choir singer Lehakwe Crystal Tlali roaming the streets and appearing worse for wear has gone viral. The talented star was known for her rendition of the popular song Modimo Re Boka Wena. EX SOWETO GOSPEL CHOIR SINGER SPARKS CONCERN On TikTok, content creator Jerry Maya posted a video of Lehakwe Tlali roaming the streets of Qwaqwa in the Free State. Maya – who works for the Department of Agriculture & Rural Development, came across the gospel singer while attending an event. “This is Lekahoe [Lehakwe] Tlali. She used to sing for the Soweto Gospel Choir. Please help her”, he captioned the heartbreaking video. In the clip, Lehakwe appeared barefoot, dishevelled, and with a cigarette in her hand. Singing for the camera, the woman admitted to once being a famous singer. When asked what happened to her, Lehakwe said: “You tell me.” In the comment section, social media users were shocked to see the talented woman appearing down and out. “I see a lot of pain in her face. She is going through something so heartbreaking.” “I know her soul is crying deep down. Go will come through for her.” “It’s clear this is a spiritual attack.” “This can happen to anyone. Life is so hard.” Sharing a video of Lehakwe Tlali leading the Soweto Gospel Choir into song, the TikToker posted: “We all deserve a second chance in life”. FROM TRAVELLING THE WORLD TO WALKING THE STREETS According to the Sowetan, Lehakwe Tlali was part of the Soweto Gospel Choir, which won two Grammy awards in 2007 and 2008 for Best Traditional World Music Album. In 2004, Lehakwe was interviewed by the Manchester Evening News during the choir’s UK tour. Lehakwe revealed that she was just 16 when she joined the choir and that she had been singing since the age of three. She said: “I send money home to my mother. When I was young, we survived because I went out on to the streets to sing. “My mother was on her own – my father left when I was very small – so I used what God gave me to help us eat and keep a roof over our heads. At the time, Lehakwe had travelled with the Soweto Gospel Choir to Europe, Asia, and Australia. She said of her rise to fame: “I can’t believe what’s happened to me. When I was on stage with Bono and Anastasia, I thought I was dreaming. When I met Nelson Mandela, my heart nearly stopped. I never thought I would leave my hometown, let alone my country. It’s unclear when Lehakwe left the Soweto Gospel Choir and what transpired thereafter.",

        "description": "An EU proposal to buy weapons for Ukraine with revenue from immobilized Russian sovereign funds remains in doubt, Josep Borrell has said Read Full Article at RT.com",
        "content": "An EU plan to use profits from frozen Russian sovereign assets to buy weapons for Ukraine has so far stalled due to resistance from Hungary, the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has acknowledged. On Monday, amid intense debate, according to a senior official, EU foreign ministers approved a legal framework to impose a windfall tax on income from Russia's immobilized funds, and to use 90% of the income to back Kiev’s war effort against Moscow. Western nations have seized some $300 billion of Russian assets, most of which are held in the EU. Brussels’ plan, which Borrell strongly supports, would provide some €3 billion ($3.23 billion) for Ukraine this year alone. Moscow has warned that it will retaliate, should its property be “stolen” by the US and its allies. Hungary, a vocal critic of Western support for Ukraine, has refused to provide any military aid to Kiev, either unilaterally or via the EU. Budapest’s approval of the arms purchase scheme is required to allow the EU “use revenues from frozen assets and to convert [them] into arms,” Borrell said. ”We have had an intense or even heated discussion on this military support for Ukraine, which is facing some obstacles in order to reach the necessary unanimity to make it effective,” he said. Some members of the bloc said during the discussion that whatever legitimate concerns Hungary may have, its opposition should be “proportional” to the urgency of sending more weapons to Ukraine, the diplomat added. Borrell declined to speculate on Hungary’s motives, when asked by a journalist whether Budapest may have a hidden agenda. Critics of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban have accused him of being “pro-Russian” due to his stance on the Ukraine conflict. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Monday that his government remained committed to blocking a separate €6.5 billion ($7 billion) military aid package for Ukraine. ”We continue to insist on the need to make peace, to stop the senseless killing, and to prevent the escalation of this war,” the minister explained. Last month, Orban called the EU’s support of Ukraine a strategic error, arguing that Brussels should promote peace between Kiev and Moscow instead.",

        "content": "When it comes to skin care exfoliation is highly essential, Glycolic Acid or Salicylic Acid can be used for better and good skincare. Two popular exfoliators that maintain skin health are glycolic acid and salicylic acid. Both the skin-safe acids are known for unclogging pores, removing dead skin cells, and improving overall skin texture. But how do you decide which one is best for your skin type? Here’s how to figure out which one would help you the best. Glycolic acid is an “AHA”, alpha hydroxy acid, derived mostly from sources such as sugar cane, citrus fruits like oranges, grapefruit, kiwi, etc. It has a small molecular size, allowing it to easily penetrate into the deep pores in skin. Exfoliation: Glycolic acid tends to soften the skin. It breaks down the fibers of dead skin cells, making the skin smoother. It removes dark spots and also brightens the skin. Anti-aging benefits : It helps boost collagen production of the skin and reduces fine lines, wrinkles and hyperpigmentation over time. Improves skin texture : With regular use, it can improve skin texture. Over the time is smoothens the skin and evens out skin tone Suitable for dry skin: Since it is an AHA, It helps hydrate the skin and maintain moisture. This makes it great for dry skin. It is even more beneficial for ageing skin as it provides moisture and keeps the skin hydrated Salicylic acid is a “BHA” or beta hydroxy acid, naturally derived from sources such as the bark, and leaves of the willow and poplar trees. It has a larger molecular size compared to glycolic acid, making it ideal for certain targeted skin problems. Opens pores: Salicylic acid is oil soluble, so it penetrates deeply into the pores of the skin to remove excess oil, impurities and dead skin cells. It is effective in preventing acne causing bacteria, which terminates the buildup of acne on skin, inflammation and also have proven to treating allergies. It reduces inflammation: It has anti-inflammatory properties, which help smooth and brighten skin complexion, especially on acne-prone skin. Basically it gets rid of the redness on skin Manages oil production: Salicylic acid helps regulate oil production of the skin, making it ideal for oily and acne-prone skin. Prevent blackheads and whiteheads : It helps in keeping pores away from debris helps prevent blackheads and whiteheads. Dry or old skin If your skin concerns relate to dry or aging skin and you want to improve your skin tone and reduce signs of aging, glycolic acid could be your best bet Oily or frequently pimpled skin If you have oily or acne-prone skin and deal with pores, dark spots, breakouts, and inflammation, salicylic acid may be the most effective exfoliator Sensitive skin Both acids can be irritating to sensitive skin, but can soften due to the anti-inflammatory properties of salicylic acid. Sometimes it is even recommended to avoid chemical exfoliators altogether when it comes to dry skin! So be careful before using any products that can be harsh on your skin. Always be sure to ” patch test” any new product you bring onto your skin. Combination skin For combination skin, you can use glycolic acid for dry areas and salicylic acid for oily or acne-prone areas. India has the most combination of skin types. It is very important to give your skin the right kind with skin care products. You can also switch between glycolic and salicylic acid exfoliants, depending on the season and weather around you and how your skin reacts to it The best exfoliators depend on your specific skin problems and characteristics. Glycolic acid is great for improving appearance and addressing signs of aging, while salicylic acid is good for clogging pores and controlling oil production Try both to find a balance just right for your skin. Always conduct a patch test on your skin before using a new skin care product. Always start with a low dosage and slowly increase if required. Consult a dermatologist for severe skin conditions.",

All 24 clubs have now been confirmed after the Whites were beaten 1-0 by Southampton as Adam Armstrong's goal sent the Saints back to the top flight at the first attempt following relegation a year ago. Daniel Farke's Leeds have immediately been installed as favourites for promotion next term, followed by relegated duo Burnley and Luton Town. Sheffield United, who were also demoted from the Premier League earlier this month, will start the season on minus-two points due to a financial breach but remain seventh favourites for the title.

The new fixture list - minus relegated Birmingham City, Huddersfield Town and Rotherham United, and promoted Leicester City, Ipswich Town and the Saints - will be announced on Wednesday, June 26 at 9am. Sky Sports will confirm television selections for August and September in early July and the rest of the picks up until January before the start of the season. The campaign will start on the weekend of August 10 and all opening matches in the EFL will be shown live on television. They can still kick-off at 3pm that Saturday because the traditional blackout rule does not apply on a weekend when there is no scheduled Premier League action. The new five-year deal with Sky that will overhaul the football calendar is worth £935 million. That is £895m in rights fees and £40m in what has been described as \"additional marketing benefits\". It is £60m per season more than the previous agreement and, the EFL claims, will mean Championship clubs are \"46 per cent better off\". There will be 46 rounds of league matches, held over 33 weekends, nine mid-weeks and four Bank Holidays in the Championship. Leagues One and Two will play on 36 weekends and six mid-weeks. The League Cup and Football League Trophy will continue with the same formats from this season. The Carabao Cup will launch in mid-August. The play-off finals, meanwhile, will take place over the 2025 May Bank Holiday weekend. Early Championship 2024/25 title odds Leeds 6/1; Burnley 13/2; Luton 10/1; Middlesbrough, Norwich, West Brom 12/1; Sheffield Utd, Coventry 14/1; Sunderland,, Portsmouth, Watford, Derby, Stoke , Hull 20/1; QPR, Sheffield Wednesday 25/1; Swansea, Bristol City, Millwall, Blackburn 28/1; Cardiff, Preston 40/1; Plymouth, Oxford 66/1.",

        "content": "A man who allegedly ran naked down the aisle of an Australian domestic flight and knocked down a crew member, forcing the plane to turn back, has been arrested by police, officials said. The alleged incident happened early in what was scheduled to be a three-and-a-half-hour Virgin Australia flight on Monday night from the west coast city of Perth to Melbourne on the east coast. Flight VA696 returned to Perth Airport due to a “disruptive passenger”, an airline statement said. Australian Federal Police officers were waiting for the plane and “the disruptive guest was offloaded”, Virgin said. Police said “officers arrested a man after he allegedly ran naked through the aircraft mid-flight and knocked a crew member to the floor”. “The man was transferred to hospital for assessment, where he remains,” a police statement said. Police expect to order the man by summons to appear in a Perth court on June 14. What charges he will face have yet to be finalised. The airline apologised to “guests impacted” by the incident, adding that the safety of passengers and crew was its top priority. Both the airline and police declined to comment beyond their statements. Australian Broadcasting Corp reported that it understood nobody was injured during the incident.",

        "content": "Former Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has a unique fan base. He is one among the most loved cricketers over the world. MS Dhoni’s fan base is so strong that even if he changes his hairstyle, his fans go wild about it. Recently, celebrity hairstylist Aalim Hakim took to his social media and shared a post of MSD’s latest hairstyle. He shared a picture of him taking mirror selfie of Dhoni smiling while he is standing behind him. He has shared the post with a caption that read, “The enigmatic Mahendra Singh Dhoni walked into our salon and what a wonderful surprise it was. Pure joy to have the legend at the salon. He played some awesome vintage music during the hair session and the day got even better. There are some moments in life which you cherish forever. Love you Mahi Sir for everything.” After being shared, the post has garnered over 2 lakh views. Earlier, MSG became the brand ambassador of the automobile brand Citroen. The advertisement of him becoming the brand ambassador for company, MS Dhoni revealed about his new team. While speaking on the commercial, MSD said that inspired by his experience during his cricketing era, he has decided to create a fan team called Citroen Team Dhoni. The purpose of this team is to provide unwavering support to Team India during their matches. Notably, MS Dhoni is one of the most loved cricketers of India. However, CSK fans are not happy with the match against RCB as reports suggest that this year’s IPL was the last IPL of MS Dhoni as he might take retirement after the tournament. Every CSK as well as MSD fan wanted to see him playing final match of this tournament. A journalist, a spiritualist, lives in a dream world.

        "content": "Источник: Андрей Бортко / NGS.RU Внедрение интеллектуальной транспортной системы (ИТС) в Новосибирске должно снизить нагрузку на некоторые перекрестки. При этом полностью пробки в городе все равно не исчезнут. Об этом 28 мая на пресс-конференции «Интерфакса» сказал министр транспорта региона Анатолий Костылевский. В Новосибирске планируют устанавливать специальные датчики и регулировать светофоры, чтобы система могла анализировать потоки транспорта и в автоматическом режиме координировать работу светофоров. — Автоматизированная система управления дорожным движением — лишь один из элементов, там достаточно много позиций, метеомонтиронинг и так далее. Задача нам вместе с Олегом Петровичем по итогам этого года достигнуть первого уровня зрелости — это 20% светофорных объектов должны быть заведены в систему. Пробки полностью в городе не исчезнут, потом что есть такой показатель, как количество единиц транспорта на одну полосу движения. Предусматривается все-таки автоматизация движения и, соответственно, это должно уменьшить нагрузку на работу определенных перекрестков, — отметил Костылевский. Министр добавил, что в прошлом году интеллектуальную транспортную систему включали в тестовом режиме, и это позволило до 27% снизить нагрузку на определенные перекрестки. НГС обратился в министерство транспорта с уточняющими вопросами по ситуации. В марте НГС писал, что с 2022 года в интеллектуальную транспортную систему в Новосибирске вложили 411 миллионов рублей . С 2024 по 2026-й будут потрачены еще 500 миллионов. В этом году в ИТС уже выделили 92,2 миллиона рублей. Самые важные новости Новосибирска и региона — в Тelegram-канале NGS.RU .

        "content": "Kosachev made the remarks after signing a book of condolence opened at Iran’s Embassy in Russia in honor of President Raisi and his entourage, who were martyred after a recent helicopter crash. The Russian official said Iran and Russia’s mutual determination to promote their unity is rooted in their history and people. He went on to say that President Raisi made history in enhancing the relations between the Russian and Iranian nations, which have experienced constant pressures from foreigners in the past decades. Despite the passing away of the Iranian president and his companions, the foundation of relations between Russia and Iran will not change, he added. Ebrahim Raisi, the eighth president of Iran, was martyred after the helicopter carrying him and his team including Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian crashed in the Varzaqan region in the northwestern Iranian province of East Azerbaijan on May 19. A book of condolence was opened in Iran’s Embassy in Moscow on May 22 for two days. Russian officials and foreign ambassadors and diplomats from 64 world countries visited the embassy and signed the book to sympathize with the Iranian nation and government over the incident. Also, the grand mosque of Moscow, the Islamic center of Moscow and the Shia hussainiyah in the Russian capital have held commemoration ceremonies to mark the late president and his entourage. 1483**4354",

An investigation in the case is underway and amid the ongoing investigation, the Pune Road Accident has been repeated! On Monday night, at around 10:30 PM in the Chandan Nagar area on the Pune Ahmednagar Road, a truck ran over two engineering students on a motorbike, killing one at the spot while the other succumbed to his injuries during treatment. After hitting the motorbike, the truck driver did not stop, instead, he tried to escape but could not run away; he was arrested by the Pune Police. As mentioned earlier, two engineering students riding a motorbike were killed after a truck ran them over in Maharashtra’s Pune city, police said today. The incident took place at around 10:30 pm on Monday in Chandan Nagar area on Pune-Ahmednagar road when three students, in their early 20s and studying at an engineering college, were on way to the Pune railway station, the police said. Two of them were to go to their hometown Latur in Maharashtra. “While they were on their way, the truck hit their motorbike from the back. A youth died on the spot, while another succumbed to injuries in a hospital,” Vimaltal police station’s inspector Anand Khobre said. The driver of the truck, after hitting the motorbike on Monday night, did not stop and tried to run away but was caught some distance away and arrested, they said. The truck driver was arrested and charged under Indian Penal Code section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and other relevant sections, the police said, adding that an investigation was on into the case. In a recent development, the father of the accused minor who hit two people with his Porsche car killing them was brought to the Crime Branch and officially arrested in an abduction case.

        "content": "'Obnoxious' video of young recruiters showing off their offices boasting a PlayStation, pool table, beauty station and beer on tap is branded 'the most convincing argument for compulsory national service' Gen Z recruiters shut down after promoting their laidback office READ MORE: I'm a recruitment expert - here's the real reasons Gen Z are struggling to get jobs, and how you can stand out from the crowd By Alice Wade Published: 09:35, 28 May 2024 | Updated: 09:35, 28 May 2024 e-mail View comments A recruitment agency has been slammed by social media users after a group of their employees shared a video of their London office, bragging about having computer games to play and a beer tap in the kitchen. The Europe-wide recruitment agency, Enzo Tech Group, posted a video on TikTok using the 'of course we' trend, which sees users sharing stereotypical habits of certain groups. Popular on social media apps such as TikTok, the hashtag has garnered more than 57.8 million views on the app. Viewers of the clip posted by Enzo Tech Group couldn't help but mock the staff, all of who appear to be Gen Z-ers, after the team was filmed flaunting their laidback office and numerous work benefits - prompting one to say it was a compelling argument for the return of National Service. In the first part of the clip, one Gen Z-er at the company is filmed filling up a pint of Peroni from the office kitchen. He said: 'We're recruiters, of course we have a beer tap in our office'. A recruitment agency has been slammed by social media users after a group of their employees (one pictured) shared an office video bragging about having computer games to play and a beer tap in the kitchen One employee is pictured, sitting on one of the work sofas with a games console in hand. He and said: 'We're recruiters, of course we've got a PlayStation , pool table and table tennis table.' The company is largely made up of Gen Z-ers. Another scene in the video explains that the team are always on their phones Later in the clip, another member of staff is filmed lounging casually on one of several sofas. Surrounded by a TV and several table games, he said: 'We're recruiters, of course we've got a PlayStation , pool table and table tennis table.' Another scene shows a woman walking past a glamorous looking vanity mirror and table loaded with beauty products. She said: 'We're recruiters, of course we have a beauty station in our office.' However, viewers of the clip quickly came up with their own hilarious versions of the trend including, 'we're recruiters, of course we failed our uni degrees'. Another user wrote: 'We're recruiters, we have nothing of value to offer society but we want money for finding people who do.' A third said: 'We're recruiters, of course we're on minimum wage! It's ok - our bonuses are free beer and a pool table'. Others had their own opinions on the clip with one writing: 'Car sales, recruitment, estate agents. Three of the most sleeze bag money grabbing con men jobs going. And these people think they are professionals?' 'Do any adults work here?' another clapped back. The agency, Enzo Tech Group, describes itself on LinkedIn as 'an on-demand service bringing IT professionals and companies together across Europe for everyone to reap the rewards.' Social media users were quick to comment on the video, mocking the staff and their office in their responses to the clip Another team member (pictured) appeared in the clip to show off the 'beauty station' in they have in the office Recruiters at the tech company say they spend a lot of their time standing up at their office desks The one-year-old company is run by recruiters and sales people with offices in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, as well as on Canon Street in London. Its website, which is filled with pictures of what appears to be a largely Gen Z team, includes zany one liners such as 'we don’t see sales as a sin'. Alongside its other quirks, desk standing, which has become an increasingly popular trend, is seemingly commonplace at the Canon Street office. As is the the habit Gen Zers are often slammed for - always being on the phone, with one employee admitting: 'We're recruiters, of course I'm always on the phone.' Other videos posted by the company also show off various work benefits, which include 'spa days' and boozy lunches out, as well as the company's Christmas party aboard a yacht.

        "description": "„Tele2“ šiemet atliktas Lietuvos darbo rinkos tyrimas atskleidė, kad darbuotojams svarbiausių papildomų naudų sąrašo viršūnėje atsidūrė lankstus darbo modelis ir tobulėjimo galimybės. Tačiau, darbdavių, siūlančių šias naudas, per metus sumažėjo. Ieva Gražienė, „Tele2“ žmogiškųjų išteklių vadovė Baltijos šalims, tikina, kad siekiant ilgam pritraukti darbuotojus, būtina ne tik užtikrinti rinkoje nusistovėjusius standartus, bet ir pasiūlyti patiems darbuotojams aktualiausias naudas, kurios atspindėtų organizacijos vertybes bei kultūrą.",
        "content": "Pasak I. Gražienės, taip yra todėl, kad konkurencingoje darbo rinkoje daugelis darbdavių siūlo gana panašų naudų paketą ir darbuotojai tai laiko ne išskirtinumu, o standartu. „Jei anksčiau darbdavys savo privalumu galėjo laikyti sveikatos draudimą, tai dabar kandidatai to nebelaiko pridėtine verte. Tai natūralus procesas, kai dalis naudų tampa savaime suprantamais dalykais, tarsi standartu, kurio tikimasi iš darbdavio. Norėdama būti konkurencinga ar išsiskirti iš kitų, įmonė turi nuolat stebėti tiek rinkos tendencijas, aktualijas, tiek ir daryti apklausas, tyrimus, siekdama išsiaiškinti, ko šiuo metu reikia būtent jos darbuotojams“, – sako I. Gražienė. Atlikus tyrimą paaiškėjo, kad ISM Vadybos ir ekonomikos universiteto Lietuvoje atliktas tyrimas parodė, kad nors , darbuotojų sprendimą vis dažniau nulemia ir kiti aspektai. Nemaža dalis kandidatams svarbių naudų susijusios su lankstumu, įmonės kultūra, socialiniais, lyderystės, darbuotojų įgalinimo aspektais. Tyrimas taip pat atskleidė, kad didžioji dauguma lietuvių sutiktų gauti net iki 30 proc. mažesnį atlyginimą su sąlyga, kad kartu jie gaus ir šias naudas. Tuo tarpu „Tele2“ atliktas tyrimas parodė, kad – tai 5 proc. daugiau nei pernai. Anot I. Gražienės, šiuos poreikius išpildyti įmanoma, jei organizacija turi stiprią vidinę kultūrą, praktikoje atsispindinčią vertybių sistemą. Vadovės teigimu, išsiskirti dabartinėje rinkoje gali tik tos įmonės, kurių siūlomos papildomos naudos atliepia pačių darbuotojų išsakomus poreikius ir stipriai remiasi organizacijos vertybėmis – bendradarbiavimu, pasitikėjimu, įgalinimu, tobulėjimo skatinimu. Visgi per metus šią naudą siūlančių darbdavių sumažėjo iki 37 proc. (2023 m. – 41 proc.). „Užpildytą šaldytuvą darbuotojai iškeičia į tobulėjimo galimybes. Darbuotojo nuolatinis tobulėjimas yra vienas pagrindinių variklių įmonei augti, ypač telekomunikacijų sektoriuje, kuris pasižymi dinamiška aplinka. Bet šios tobulėjimo galimybės labiau priskiriamos prie organizacijos kultūros – jausmo, kad kartu augdami siekiame bendrų tikslų, o ne prie įprastų naudų paketo“, – teigia I. Gražienė. Vadovė priduria, kad laimi ir tie darbdaviai, kurie gali atsižvelgti į individualius darbuotojų gebėjimus, poreikius. „Kiekvienam darbuotojui svarbūs labai skirtingi dalykai. Akivaizdu, kad ne visiems įmonės darbuotojams aktualu mokytis tą patį. Todėl, ten, kur matome panašų poreikį, „Tele2“ darbuotojams organizuojame bendrus mokymus. Tuo tarpu biure, kur turime daug skirtingų pareigybių ir poreikių, siūlome individualų mokymų krepšelį. Lygiai taip pat su naudų paketu – nors kai kurios naudos yra vienodos, kitas leidžiame darbuotojams pasirinkti patiems. Tai taip pat susiję su mūsų kultūra – vertiname žmonių individualumą ir skirtumus“, – tikina I. Gražienė.",

        "content": "Chairman of Oyo State Universal Basic Education Board, Dr Nureni Adeniran yesterday said the state government has put in place deliberate policies to encourage basic education for children, especially in the face of the global economic meltdown. The SUBEB chairman who felicitated with pupils in the state, as they celebrated Children’s Day, stressed that children, both in public and private schools deserve the best form of education, as they were the most vital asset of the state. He noted, “Our sweat for our children today is a promise for a better tomorrow.” Adeniran, an educationist, added that stakeholders must of necessity invest in children to reap the benefits of rapid national growth. He wished Nigerian children, especially pupils in public basic schools across the state, a rewarding celebration. The chairman prayed “May the innocence and promise of our children fill our homes and hearts with happiness and fond memories to cherish forever.” Meanwhile, the senator representing Oyo South Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Sharafadeen Alli has called for the creation of a safe and conducive environment for all children across the country to thrive. The lawmaker, while felicitating with the children on this year’s Children’s Day celebration, urged them to uphold the virtues of good behaviour and discipline. He urged children to remain obedient and respectful, stressing the fundamental role these virtues play in forming their personalities and shaping a brighter future for themselves and the country. He stressed that obedience forms the bedrock of character development, describing it as essential for personal and societal progress. Alli acknowledged the efforts of parents and guardians, praising their dedication as well as commitment to raising responsible citizens.",

La amenaza telefónica de un artefacto explosivo en el instituto provocó la movilización inmediata de patrullas policiales, que se desviaron de otros servicios para desalojar el instituto y establecer un perímetro de seguridad. Los especialistas en desactivación de explosivos (TEDAX) llevaron a cabo inspecciones detalladas en las instalaciones y, al no encontrar ningún indicio de amenaza, concluyeron que se trataba de una falsa alarma. Dada la naturaleza delictiva de los hechos, la policía inició una investigación para identificar al responsable de la llamada y la consiguiente alteración del orden público. A pesar de que la llamada se realizó con un número oculto y una voz distorsionada, las autoridades lograron identificar al titular de la línea telefónica. El responsable fue un menor de 12 años, hijo del titular del teléfono, quien realizó la llamada sin el conocimiento de sus padres. El menor está exento de responsabilidad penal debido a su edad. Sin embargo, los hechos han sido comunicados a la autoridad correspondiente, y podría haber sanciones económicas . De ser impuestas, las multas serían responsabilidad de los padres del menor. La Policía Nacional recuerda que realizar falsas alarmas o simular situaciones de peligro para la comunidad, como una amenaza de bomba, que requiera la movilización de servicios públicos de seguridad, asistencia o salvamento, puede constituir un delito de desórdenes públicos. Este delito puede conllevar penas de prisión de 3 meses a 1 año o multas de 3 a 18 meses.",

Die Motoren sollen auch mit CO2-freien Kraftstoffen wie E-Fuels oder Biosprit laufen. Wann entsprechende Modelle auf den Markt kommen, ist unklar. Der weltweit größte Autobauer und Spezialist für Hybridantriebe ist spät bei reinen batterieelektrischen Antrieben eingestiegen. Die Japaner fahren einen technologieoffenen Kurs, da nicht in allen Weltregionen der Umstieg auf E-Autos so schnell vorangetrieben wird wie in Europa, wo ab 2035 keine konventionellen Verbrennungsmotoren mehr auf den Markt kommen. Vorstandschef Akio Toyoda geht davon aus, dass E-Autos weltweit nur einen Absatzanteil von 30 Prozent erreichen werden, während der Rest auf Hybride und Brennstoffzellen-Fahrzeuge entfallen könnte.",

        "description": "As the government called for Israel to stop its military campaign in Rafah, a major global medical charity urged Australia to implement sanctions on Israel.",
        "content": "Foreign Minister Penny Wong has demanded that Israel halt its military campaign in the southern Gazan city of Rafah after dozens of civilians were killed in an air strike, as a global medical charity called for Australia to implement sanctions on Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his nation’s military had made a “tragic mistake” in an air strike that set fire to a camp housing displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to Reuters. Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong said the death and destruction in Rafah was “horrific”. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen Wong said the events of the past 24 hours had shown why world leaders, including Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, had forcefully warned Israel against launching a military campaign in Rafah, a city where over a million Palestinians from elsewhere in Gaza have sought refuge during the war. “The death and destruction in Rafah is horrific,” Wong told Senate estimates hearings in Canberra. “This human suffering is unacceptable. “We reiterate to the government of Israel: this cannot continue.” Wong called for “an immediate humanitarian ceasefire so civilians can be protected”, saying Australia continued to support the work of the United States, Qatar and Egypt to that end. “We continue to call for the release of all hostages by Hamas and for Israel to allow aid to flow at scale, as directed by the International Court of Justice,” she said. Albanese said the government had consistently opposed an Israeli ground offensive in Rafah, telling parliamentary question time: “We must have a humanitarian ceasefire so that civilian life can be protected. “We must have increased humanitarian assistance delivered to Gaza.” Christos Christou, the global president of Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders), told the National Press Club he wanted the government to take “immediate, concrete actions to hold Israel to account” for its conduct during the war. “Australia must apply appropriate sanctions on Israel, as it would to any other global state that refuses to comply with UN Security Council resolutions,” Christou said. “Honestly, I have run out of words. “I wish I could find the words to express the smell of infected wounds, the cries of mothers who’ve lost their children, the constant sound of drones, the level of desperation of my colleagues.” Christou accused Israel of conducting an “indiscriminate and disproportionate military campaign” and “pursuing a policy of deliberate deprivation, only allowing a trickle of food and water to enter Gaza”. The Medecins sans Frontieres charter says the charity is committed to “impartiality and neutrality” but adds that these values “are not synonymous with silence” when it comes to providing lifesaving medical care. The Israeli embassy in Canberra did not respond to a request for comment. Netanyahu told the Israeli parliament that “we are investigating the case and will draw the conclusions”. “In Rafah, we evacuated a million uninvolved residents and, despite our best efforts, a tragic accident happened,” he said. Israel has insisted that it needs to conduct a military campaign in Rafah to dismantle Hamas’ remaining battalions and secure the return of hostages taken captive during the militant group’s October 7 attacks on Israeli towns. Hamas killed 1200 people in those attacks and took more than 200 hostages, according to Israel’s defence force. In response, Israel launched air strikes and a ground invasion of Gaza that, according to the local health ministry, has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, injured more than 80,000 and displaced more than 1.7 million. Israel’s arguments have failed to resonate with most world leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, who said he was outraged by the strikes. “These operations must stop,” he said. “There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians.” The Foreign Office of Germany, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel for decades, said “the images of charred bodies, including children, from the airstrike in Rafah are unbearable”. Italian Defence Minister Guido Crosetto said attacks against Palestinian civilians in Gaza can “no longer be justified”.

Germany's DAX gained 0.3% to 18,828.68 while the CAC 40 in Paris edged 0.1% lower to 8,121.17. In Britain, the FTSE 100 shed 0.2% to 8,303.25, reopening from a bank holiday on Monday. The future for the S&P 500 was up 0.2% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 0.1% higher. In Asian trading, Chinese markets rose and then fell after senior leaders of the ruling Communist Party met and affirmed Beijing’s determination to contain financial risks. The Shanghai Composite index dropped 0.5% to 3,109.57. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost less than 1 point to 18,821.16. The Chinese government recently eased interest rates and down payment requirements for housing loans as part of its effort to revive the property sector after a crackdown on excessive borrowing caused defaults among many developers. The housing industry plays a huge role in driving the economy and its troubles have weighed on growth. The meetings Monday led by Chinese President Xi Jinping “noted that preventing and defusing financial risks is a major challenge,\" the official Xinhua News Agency reported. Efforts to strengthen oversight “should be implemented strictly to send a strong signal that any violator will be held accountable, so that financial oversight will actually have ‘teeth and thorns’ and be sharp-pointed,” Xinhua said.

        "content": "Japan, Australia, the Philippines, and the US have joined forces to step up regional defence diplomacy against China. The US is coming up with another counter to China’s growing ambitions in the Indo-Pacific. Replacing Quad, aka the ‘Quadrilateral Security Dialogue’, is the Squad, a budding new defence partnership in the region. So, what is Squad, the new grouping in the Indo-Pacific? News9 Plus decodes Japan, Australia, the Philippines, and the US have joined forces to step up regional defence diplomacy against China. The four-way informal grouping is being referred to as the ‘Squad’ by Pentagon officials. On May 2nd, US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin hosted counterparts from Japan, Australia, and the Philippines for a summit in Hawaii. Hawaii is home to the US Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM). What led to the emergence of SQUAD? The new quadrilateral is rapidly consolidating into a long-term security grouping. The four Squad nations are set to enhance interoperability, conduct more joint patrols and drills, and enhance intelligence and maritime security cooperation. At the heart of it all will be China’s expanding footprint across the Western Pacific. Why does the Philippines matter to the US? The biggest driver of a recent surge in activity by the four Squad nations concerning Indo-Pacific security networking is the Philippines. The US-Philippine alliance has provided Squad with the necessary platform. It is also in line with US President Joe Biden’s emphasis on operartionalising security networking with allies and partners. When Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. visited the White House earlier this year, a joint statement was inked. This statement directly mentioned, next to a reference to the Quad, advancing “trilateral modes of cooperation” between the US, Australia, and the Philippines as well as the US, Japan, and the Philippines. The May 7 meeting also came just as the US, Japan, and the Philippines were conducting a first-ever coast guard exercise. Unlike India, which remains a close Russian ally, the Philippines is a US defence treaty ally, committed to strengthening its relationships with Australia and Japan. The US now has rotational military access to more Philippine bases, including facilities close to Taiwan. Where does the Squad score over Quad? Experts say the Squad has greater internal coherence and a clear shared strategic vision for the region, in contrast to the better-known Quad, a security partnership between India, Australia, the US, and Japan. India’s refusal to align with the West’s stance on Russia has put more strain on the old Quad. To add to this strain, despite its heated border disputes with China, India has refused to join any coalition or major drills aimed at constraining Beijing’s maritime ambitions. Even as China sees Squad as part of the American containment strategy, the Philippines views it as a legitimate effort to protect its sovereign rights.",

        "content": "Monday Night Raw came to an end with a shocking kiss between Liv Morgan and former WWE champion Rey Mysterio's son Dominic Mysterio aka Dirty Dom. New Delhi: Liv Morgan defended her WWE Women’s World Championship title in Monday Night Raw on May 28. She defeated Becky Lynch in a Steel Cage match in the main event of the show. What shocked the entire world was that after the main event, Morgan forcibly kissed the Dirty Dom, who came to help Morgan successfully defend her title. A post shared by WWE (@wwe) It started with Dirty Dom coming out from backstage to help Morgan escape the cage in the steel cage match, but then his team Judgement Day members came to stop him from getting involved in the match. Also, the feud between Braun Strowman and McDonagh (Judgement Day member) resulted in Strowman coming out from backstage and chasing both members of Judgment Day. In what looked like a Tom and Jerry fight, Strowman ran into the Dirty Dom and pushed him into the cage door, forcing it to open. The door opened up in the face of Lynch, who went down after the blow allowing Morgan to escape the steel cage. Strawman’s intervention and his clash with Myesterio worked in the favour of Morgan, who capitalised on the opportunity to get out of the cage as soon the door opened. Now, it’s interesting to watch how this storyline between Morgan and Dirty Dom works after the kiss in the next week of Monday Night Raw.",

        "content": "With an aim to give back to communities, the Digicel staff have carried out six organised volunteer activities across its different centres. The activities were organised by Digicel PNG foundation through its Live Love Learn (3L) Staff engagement Program. The program was carried out during the Digicel make a difference week from 6 to 12 May 2024 and included community service and donations to community- based organisations. The Make a Difference week is about giving back to the community through acts of kindness. Digicel PNG staff used their Foundation Day, a paid leave day provided by the company to staff for participating in any volunteer activity. A total of 137 staff volunteered 781 hours of company time in the six activities hosted during the Digicel Make a Difference week. Digicel PNG staff in Port Moresby started the week with cleaning around Gordons area, including outside Wardstrip Demonstration Primary School. The staff in Eastern and Western Highlands Provinces did donation visits to three organisations operating orphanages; Salvation Army in Goroka, Bible Faith Outreach Centre and the daughters of Destiny Centre in Mt. Hagen. The staff also did classroom refurbishments and cleaning at Gelegele Baie Elementary School in East New Britain Province, and City Mission’s New Life Christian Primary School in Central Province. In Lae, Digicel staff collaborated with Dulux Group, Solar Solutions and Professionals to refurbish and donate needed items to the maternity ward at the Busamang Sub-Health Centre in the Huon District of Morobe Province. Digicel PNG Acting CEO, Ketan Mehta was pleased to see staff from across the five centres taking part in the Make a Difference week. “As an organization, we are proud of Digicel PNG Foundation’s work in the communities and the ‘change maker’ week extended an opportunity for the wider Digicel PNG staff to be part of these rewarding activities. “At Digicel, we know that we are a part of thriving communities and our staff are always willing and happy to champion good behaviours that make a real difference, through the work of Digicel PNG Foundation. Simple activities of help like painting classrooms, cleaning our offices and surrounding areas, schools and public locations speak to our brand that we are better together.” The week of organized volunteering is an annual event that started last year as ‘Changemakers’ week. Digicel PNG Foundation is excited to work with staff in continuing this tradition of giving back to the communities so that no one is left behind.",

        "content": "This was said in a statement yesterday by Nangula Uaandja, chairperson and chief executive of the Namibia Investment Promotion and Development Board (NIPDB), which is co-hosting the event. “The government has implemented the International Tourism Revival Initiative, with key objectives including creating new tourism routes and expanding tourism product offerings, including the establishment of the Namibia Convention Bureau aimed at branding and promoting Namibia as a meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions destination,” said Uaandja. “This has opened up unique investment opportunities that further enhance the attractiveness of Namibia as an investment destination. We are looking forward to showcasing some of these opportunities which hold immense economic potential at AHIF 2024. Our team at NIPDB is always ready to help investors to have a seamless entry and ensure a soft landing in Namibia,” she said. According to a statement issued yesterday by AHIF founder Matthew Weihs, more than 300 hospitality industry delegates from over 50 countries will meet for three days of high-level networking, formal business meetings and discussions of the latest trends and developments in the sector. He said AHIF is the most influential annual gathering of hospitality industry investors, business leaders, government officials, bankers and expert advisers on the African continent. This is the first time the event is coming to southern Africa, after Namibia won the bid to host the forum last year and already O&L Leisure has started the ball rolling, injecting a N$500 000 sponsorship for the forum. According to the statement, topics expected to be high on this year’s agenda include active development, financial institutions, artificial intelligence, authentic leisure, aviation connectivity, conservation and demographics. Also lined up for discussion are female power, government initiatives to support hospitality, hotel development, hotelification of the workspace, international and lifestyle brands, investing in Namibia, the new global geopolitical order and its impact on hospitality, new ventures, optimal capital structure, people, resorts, sustainability and more. “Prominent speakers include Namibia’s environment, forestry and tourism minister Pohamba Shifeta and several top executives who, between them, have the power to transform a destination by funding projects, create thousands of employment opportunities and boost international tourism, which is a major source of export revenue for many African countries,” said Weihs. They include TUI Blue managing director Artur Gerber; Kasada Capital Management managing partner and CEO Olivier Granet; Millennium Hotels and Resorts and Lakhraim Group CEO Fahad Kazim; Middle East, Africa and South-West Asia IHG Hotels and Resorts managing director Haitham Mattar; Accor Middle East and Africa chief operating officer Paul Stevens and many more high-calibre executives. Weihs added: “Namibia’s confirmation that the president will headline the AHIF agenda leaves me feeling optimistic about the country’s commitment to its tourism and hospitality sector. “His presence not only signals that Namibia values the international hospitality investment community, but it also reinforces everything we have heard from our hosts about wanting to create a thriving visitor economy,” he said. – email: matthew@namibian.com.na",

        "content": "DIIV songwriter Zachary Cole Smith has spoken about the way addiction is viewed through the prism of the media. The American artist has been through some dark times, with addiction issues almost re-railing his career. Arrested in 2013 alongside then-partner Sky Ferreira , he has been through treatment, and emerged into a period of personal and creative security. New album ‘Frog In Boiling Water’ is out now , but many reviews have chosen to view the record through the lens of his experiences with addiction. Deciding to offer a counter narrative, Zachary Cole Smith posted a thought-provoking mini-essay on Twitter / x . — — Hi – something that’s been on my mind for the last few days in regards to general discourse around our band but especially @pitchfork ’s recent review of our record that I wanted to address and then hopefully move on from: Addiction is a disease. It’s hard to view one’s own past living through the horrors of that disease as a type of scarlet letter that can’t be shaken even after many years of intense self-work in sobriety within a program of recovery. The past is unchangeable, for sure, and much of any spiritual program of recovery deals in acceptance of that past, alongside a head-on confrontation of the defects of one’s own character which guided its construction. Still, living today as a sober person, a husband and a parent, it’s difficult to see my own work met with an unwillingness to accept me as the person I’ve worked so diligently the last eight years to become, or an unshakeable desire to revel in the sick person I once was. It makes me feel sad for my bandmates whose material livelihood is still at the mercy of a public tendency to root discussion of our band around a past that they personally suffered from as well. It makes me feel sad for addicts who aspire to achieve a beautiful new life outside or in the aftermath of their disease but feel overwhelmed by the crushing weight of the wreckage they may have caused. Recovery is possible. I’m learning to forgive myself, but it isn’t an easy task. Coming to terms with the shame and guilt of living in active addiction is a part of recovery but addicts, like anyone, are deserving of compassion, both from themselves and from others. Musicians are people and addicts are people. People aren’t monolithic, one-dimensional caricatures; people are complex and capable of profound change. I wish this wasn’t something I felt I needed to say, but here I am saying it anyway. —",

        "content": "ARD: Alexander Bommes verhöhnt \"Gefragt – Gejagt\"-Kandidatin Bei \"Gefragt – Gejagt\" treten absolute Quiz-Experten gegen \"Normalos\" an. Quizzer wie Sebastian Klussmann und der kürzlich verstorbene Klaus Otto Nagorsnik erreichten mit ihrem ungewöhnlich großen Allgemeinwissensschatz sogar eine gewisse Prominenz. ARD: Alexander Bommes lässt sich zu Spott hinreißen Die oberste Instanz in der Vorabend-Quizshow \"Gefragt – Gejagt\" bildet dennoch Moderator Alexander Bommes. Er prägt die Atmosphäre im Saal und seine Sympathie kann auch mal über ein Kandidat:innen-Schicksal entscheiden. Und nicht selten schießt der Moderator übers Ziel hinaus. In der \"Gefragt – Gejagt\"-Folge vom Montag machte sich Bommes einen Spaß aus der Ahnungslosigkeit seiner Kandidat:innen. Anschließend plagte ihn das schlechte Gewissen. Vier Kandidat:innen traten am Montag gegen den \"Jäger\" Sebastian Klussmann an, der letztes Jahr auch in der RTL-Show \"Die Verräter\" zu sehen war. Bei einer Frage kamen Kandidatin Anja und der Jäger ins Straucheln. Und darum ging es: Wer war für die Vorbereitung, Durchführung und die Nachbereitung der Wahl des Bundespräsidenten 2022 zuständig? Der Kommentar von Alexander Bommes zum vermeintlich niedrigen Schwierigkeitsgrad der Frage: \"Das machen wir schnell weg hier.\" Als der Jäger seine Kopfschmerzen andeutete, meinte Bommes spöttisch: \"Och, Klussmann!\" - \"Nein, überhaupt nicht!\" - \"Wie, 'Nein überhaupt nicht'?\" Dann, noch vor der Bekanntgabe der richtigen Antwort, holte Bommes zu seiner Erklärung aus: \"Meinen Sie, der Bundeskanzler plant so 'ne Bundestagswahl? Und meinen Sie, die Innenministerin hat nicht schon genug zu tun und plant noch so ein bisschen organisatorisch die Bundesversammlung?\" Der Jäger fühlte sich sichtlich in die Ecke gedrängt. Alexander Bommes muss sich entschuldigen Dann wandte sich Bommes an die Kandidatin Anja: \"Wen hast du genommen?\" Anja hatte sich tatsächlich für Bundeskanzler Olaf Scholz entschieden und brachte damit wiederum Bommes in eine schwierige Lage: Er hatte indirekt auch seinen Show-Gast verspottet. \"Oh, Entschuldigung, ich wollte mich nicht lustig machen\", ruderte er zurück. Die richtige Antwort auf die Frage ist Bärbel Bas, die Präsidentin des Deutschen Bundestages. Klussmann hatte Innenministerin Nancy Faeser gewählt. \"Wir schneiden das jetzt raus!\", meinte er scherzhaft und schob dann ernster in Richtung Moderator hinterher: \"Sie haben mich vollkommen verunsichert.\" Und so endete die Runde für alle Beteiligten auf einer unangenehmen Note.",

        "content": "The Supreme Court has allowed the transfer of the criminal cases filed against Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KOJC) founder Apollo Quiboloy from Davao City to Quezon City. According to the court, it granted the request of Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla on Monday to move the venue to a Quezon City Regional Trial Court (RTC) to avoid a miscarriage of justice. “The Court found compelling reasons to justify the transfer of venue as the cases involve public interest, with the accused, a well-known religious leader, being influential in the area,” the SC said in a statement. “As this could cause local biases and a strong possibility that witnesses cannot freely testify due to fear and influence of the accused, the Court found it prudent and judicious to order the transfer of the cases to Quezon City,” it added. The Court directed the Clerk of Court of Davao City RTC Branch 12 to forward the records of the cases to the Office of the Executive Judge of the QC RTC within three days from notice. Quiboloy is facing charges under Section 5(b) of Republic Act 7610 or the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation, and Discrimination Act and under Section 10(a) of the same act before the Davao court. Meanwhile, the court directed the QC RTC Executive Judge to raffle off the cases. It also ordered judges in Davao City and in other Mindanao stations to motu proprio order the transmittal of the records of future related cases involving Quiboloy and his co-accused to the Office of the Clerk of the QC RTC or the QC Metropolitan Trial Court. When sought for comment, Atty. Ferdinand Topacio, Quiboloy’s legal counsel, said he has yet to read the order. Quiboloy is also facing a non-bailable Qualified Human Trafficking charge under Section 4(a) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended before a Pasig court. He previously said that he was ready to face his cases provided that the Marcos administration give him written assurance that the United States would not interfere in his legal battle in the Philippines. In response, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. vowed that the proceedings against him will be fair . He also saw Quiboloy setting conditions for his surrender as \"a bit of tail wagging the dog.\" — RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

The general also expressed belief that the of France to assist Ukraine would encourage Kiev’s other foreign backers to take part in the project to train troops on Ukrainian soil. A few hours later, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry issued a statement clarifying Syrsky’s comment. The ministry confirmed that Kiev had expressed an interest in hosting foreign instructors on its territory back in February, but stressed that it Ukraine’s Defense Ministry and the General Staff have, meanwhile, started preparing internal paperwork related to the deployment of the trainers in order it explained. The French Defense Ministry told AFP that it is still studying the issue of sending instructors to Ukraine, but declined to confirm the deployment. it said. The project according to the ministry. In February, Macron said that he couldn’t rule out the possibility of NATO member states sending troops to Ukraine amid the conflict with Russia. He has reiterated the claim several times over the past few months. According to the French leader, his policy of is intended to keep Moscow guessing about NATO’s intentions and the lengths it is willing to go to in support of Kiev. Estonia and Lithuania have since then expressed a readiness to send either instructors or support troops to free up Ukrainian soldiers in the rear for combat duty. No NATO-Russia clash over Ukraine – Berlin Earlier this month, Russia slammed Macron’s statements as and insisted that his attempts to create for Moscow were In March, the deputy chairman of Russia’s State Duma, Pyotr Tolstoy, warned in an interview with French broadcaster BFMTV that",

        "content": "Am 1. Jänner 2024 lebten 9.158.750 Menschen in Österreich, 53.978 (plus 0,6 Prozent) mehr als ein Jahr zuvor. 2022 war die Bevölkerung noch um 125.843 Personen bzw. 1,4 Prozent gewachsen. Nur die Wanderungsbilanz fiel positiv aus, die Geburtenbilanz das vierte Jahr in Folge stark negativ: „2023 verstarben rund 12.000 Personen mehr, als zur Welt kamen. Das ist das höchste Geburtendefizit seit Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs“, sagte Statistik-Austria-Generaldirektor Tobias Thomas. „Ursache des Bevölkerungswachstums war auch 2023 ausschließlich die Zuwanderung. Insgesamt kamen 2023 knapp 67.000 Menschen mehr aus dem Ausland als Österreich verließen“, berichtete Thomas am Dienstag aus der Bevölkerungsstatistik. In Wien gab es 2023 mit plus 1,2 Prozent das stärkste Wachstum, gefolgt von Vorarlberg (plus 0,9 Prozent). In Tirol und Salzburg (je plus 0,6 Prozent) entsprach der Anstieg in etwa dem österreichweiten Durchschnitt. Unterdurchschnittliche Zuwächse gab es in Oberösterreich (plus 0,5 Prozent), der Steiermark (plus 0,4 Prozent), in Niederösterreich (plus 0,3 Prozent) sowie im Burgenland (plus 0,2 Prozent). Mit einem Plus von 0,1 Prozent verzeichnete Kärnten den geringsten Anstieg. 77.605 Kinder wurden geboren, um 6,1 Prozent weniger als 2022 – der niedrigste Wert seit 2009, als 76.344 Babys zur Welt kamen. Die Gesamtfertilitätsrate lag mit 1,32 Kindern pro Frau deutlich unter dem Vorjahreswert von 1,41 und sogar knapp unter dem bisherigen Allzeit-Minimum von 1,33 Kindern pro Frau aus dem Jahr 2001. Bei der Gesamtfertilitätsrate waren erneut Vorarlberg mit 1,50 und Oberösterreich mit 1,45 Kindern pro Frau Spitzenreiter. Über dem Bundesschnitt von 1,32 Kindern pro Frau lagen zudem Niederösterreich, Salzburg, Steiermark und Kärnten. Geringer war die Gesamtfertilitätsrate 2023 in Wien, im Burgenland und in Tirol – zwischen 1,17 und 1,31. 2023 verstarben 89.760 Personen, um 3,8 Prozent weniger als im Jahr davor. Damit lag die Zahl der Gestorbenen erstmals seit 2020 wieder unter der Marke von 90.000 Personen, aber nach wie vor auf deutlich höherem Niveau als von 2015 bis 2019. Die Säuglingssterberate betrug 2,8 Prozent (2022: 2,4 Prozent). Die Lebenserwartung bei der Geburt stieg gegenüber dem Vorjahr sowohl bei Männern mit 79,4 Jahren als auch bei Frauen mit 84,2 Jahren um je 0,4 Jahre. Damit erreichte sie bei Frauen wieder das Niveau vor Beginn der Corona-Pandemie und lag bei Männern nur mehr um 0,1 Jahre unter dem Wert von 2019. Das traditionelle West-Ost-Gefälle bei der Lebenserwartung nach Bundesländern blieb fast erhalten – leichte Verschiebungen gab es in Kärnten und im Burgenland. Wurden Männer in Tirol, Vorarlberg und Salzburg im Mittel über 80,5 Jahre alt, lag ihre Lebenserwartung in der Steiermark, in Oberösterreich und im Burgenland zwischen 79,4 und 79,8 Jahren. In Wien, Niederösterreich und in Kärnten erreichten Männer im Durchschnitt nur ein Alter zwischen 78,6 und 79,0 Jahren. Bei der Lebenserwartung der Frauen waren Kärnten, Vorarlberg und Tirol mit 84,7 bis 85,3 Jahren führend. In der Steiermark, in Oberösterreich und in Salzburg lag die Lebenserwartung der Frauen zwischen 84,4 und 84,6 Jahren, während die östlichen Bundesländer Wien, Niederösterreich und Burgenland Werte von 83,3 bis 84,3 Jahren aufwiesen. Die Geburtenbilanz, der Saldo aus Lebendgeborenen und Gestorbenen, fiel mit minus 12.155 zum vierten Mal in Folge seit 2020 negativ aus und erreichte den tiefsten Wert seit Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs. Allerdings mit deutlichen Unterschieden zwischen den Bundesländern: Wien (plus 823), Vorarlberg (plus 565) und Tirol (plus 119) erzielten, wie in den Vorjahren, Geburtenüberschüsse. Weniger Neugeborene als Gestorbene gab es in Niederösterreich (minus 5.598), in der Steiermark (minus 3.160), in Kärnten (minus 2.259), im Burgenland (minus 1.477), in Oberösterreich (minus 1.116) und in Salzburg (minus 52). 194.959 Personen aus dem Ausland zogen 2023 nach Österreich und 128.330 wanderten ab. Daraus ergab sich ein Außenwanderungssaldo von plus 66.629 Personen. Im Jahr zuvor war er mehr als doppelt so groß, was vor allem auf die starke Zuwanderung aus der Ukraine zurückzuführen war. Die Netto-Zuwanderung von Personen ohne österreichische Staatsangehörigkeit (plus 71.889) setzte sich zu 41 Prozent aus Staatsangehörigen eines EU- oder EFTA-Staates bzw. Angehörigen des Vereinigten Königreiches und zu 59 Prozent aus anderen Drittstaatsangehörigen zusammen. Unter Angehörigen von EU- und EFTA-Staaten hatten Deutsche (plus 8.458), Ungarinnen und Ungarn (plus 6.745) sowie Menschen aus Kroatien und Rumänien (jeweils plus 3.875) die höchsten Salden. Bei Drittstaatsangehörigen waren es Menschen mit syrischer (plus 13.890), türkischer (plus 5.024) und afghanischer (plus 2.561) Nationalität. Am 1. Jänner 2024 lebten 1.800.866 Menschen mit nicht-österreichischer Nationalität in Österreich, am 1. Jänner 2023 waren es 1.729.820 gewesen. Der Anteil ausländischer Staatsangehöriger stieg von 19 auf 19,7 Prozent. Wien hat mit 35,4 Prozent den höchsten Anteil, gefolgt von Vorarlberg (20,6 Prozent) und Salzburg (20,3 Prozent). Den niedrigsten Anteil weist das Burgenland mit 11,4 Prozent auf, davor liegen Niederösterreich mit 12,2 und Kärnten mit 13,2 Prozent. Unter den Bundesländern verzeichnete Wien den größten Wanderungsgewinn aus dem Ausland: Mit plus 21.959 Personen entfiel rund ein Drittel (33 Prozent) des Außenwanderungssaldos Österreichs auf die Bundeshauptstadt. Ebenfalls eine hohe Netto-Zuwanderung aus dem Ausland gab es in Oberösterreich (plus 9.283) und der Steiermark (plus 8.989). Am niedrigsten war sie im Burgenland (plus 878) und in Vorarlberg (plus 1.659).",

        "content": "hapabapa It's been a rough couple of years for Wayfair ( NYSE: W ), but the company is focused on its rebound plan. The online furniture retailer, also the largest pure-play e-commerce vendor for furniture, has seen roughly ~flat stock price action this year. As it looks ahead to the second half of 2024, the company has a brand-new advertising campaign in place and notes that its y/y revenue declines have stopped. The question now is: while Wayfair's management is bullish on its future, can the stock truly stage a turnaround? Data by YCharts All eyes on a second half rebound, as Wayfair plans a number of new growth initiates to revive growth I last wrote a bearish article on Wayfair in mid-April, when the stock was still trading in the mid-$50s. Since then, the company has unveiled a new growth strategy for the second half of the year alongside releasing Q1 results - which, though poor and showcased a continuation of revenue declines, management signaled as the low point of the year and that conditions should improve from here. With all this in mind, I think expectations have correctly reset lower for Wayfair and that the stock is poised for at least a small-scale turnaround: and acknowledging that, I'm boosting my rating on Wayfair to neutral. First, a rundown on the company's turnaround plans: Management is putting its weight behind a new marketing campaign, \"Wayborhood.\" The campaign has already started running ads across traditional and social media formats, leveraging high-budget celebrities including an Olympian, social media influencers, and longtime brand ambassador Kelly Clarkson. The company believes the second half of the year will see a category-based rebound. Management notes that life events and house moves prompt furniture re-buys, and after a long drought in the space, furniture and home goods companies are bound for a turnaround. This is the reason the company is spending tremendously on its \"Wayborhood\" campaign to revive growth in the second half. Physical retail store. Wayfair opened its very first retail store in Willamette, IL just recently in late May. While certainly a cost adder for a company that made its name in e-commerce, there's a chance that having physical store outlets can legitimize Wayfair's brand in consumers' eyes, give it distinction versus Amazon and help it compete with the likes of Home Goods and IKEA. Despite these aggressive expansion plans to return to growth, I do think it's also appropriate to maintain some level of caution here. To me, these are the core risks to keep in mind: Sharp competition, especially from cheaper overseas manufacturers. Already domestically, Wayfair competes with a number of venerable vendors including Home Goods and Amazon; but overseas, both Chinese furniture makers and companies like IKEA appeal on the price front. International losses. In part due to lack of brand recognition overseas, Wayfair has continued to invest in expanding overseas operations, but its international segment is dragging the overall company down on adjusted EBITDA. The bottom line here: I'd continue to adopt a cautious stance on Wayfair going forward, but with the company indicating that Q2 will return to growth and with the number of initiatives the company has under its belt for the second half of this year, it's also challenging to bet against this name. I'd recommend keeping this on your watch list, but don't jump in just yet, as we need more clarity on the performance of Wayfair's growth initiatives before we can get comfortable with the longer-term story. Q1 download Let's now go through Wayfair's latest quarterly results in greater detail. The Q1 earning highlights are shown in the snapshot below: Wayfair Q1 results (Wayfair Q1 earnings release) Wayfair's revenue continued to decline slightly at a -1.7% y/y pace in Q1 to $2.73 billion, though this did substantially beat Wall Street's expectations of $2.64 billion (-5% y/y) by a three-point margin. Management also continues to emphasize its belief that despite revenue declines, Wayfair is picking up market share - it notes that the furniture category as a whole was down in the \"low double digits\" in Q1. Wayfair's number of orders remained ~flat at 10 million, while average order values declined slightly to $285 (the company no longer has a pricing lever to boost revenue as customers are finally pushing back on price inflation). The company also said Q1 was the sixth straight quarter of outperformance versus the broader furniture industry. The good news here that made Q1 results well-received in the markets: the company hinted that Q1 was the low point of growth, and that Q2 will return to flat or positive y/y comps. Per CFO Kate Gulliver's remarks on the Q1 earnings call (key points highlighted): We know there is a lot of attention around when we will finally see some stability in spending on home furnishings. And, while the timing of the inflection point is inherently uncertain, it’s important to remember that this is a category where consumers have now structurally underspent compared to typical patterns prior to the pandemic. We know that eventually the need reverts as life goes on. People get married. They have kids. Kids move out. The need for home furnishings never goes away, and over time, the category will rebound and return to its typical pattern of growth. Within that context, as we approach a back half of 2024 that comps over a declining macro for a category in 2023, we are excited to be launching the Wayborhood campaign with a new voice to get in front of our customers. As our shoppers are ready to get out and update their home, Wayfair will be top of mind [...] Beginning with the topline controlling for the timing of Way Day, which took place in April last year, quarter-to-date we are trending approximately flat year-over-year and expect to end the quarter flat to slightly positive. \" From a profitability standpoint, note that Wayfair boosted its adjusted EBITDA to $75 million in the quarter, versus a -$14 million loss in the year-ago Q1. Adjusted EBITDA margins, meanwhile, saw 320bps of expansion to 2.7% in the quarter. Wayfair adjusted EBITDA (Wayfair Q1 earnings release) The company continues to expect achieving $600 million in adjusted EBITDA for FY24, and a long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target of 10%+ driven by operating leverage and efficiencies on marketing, plus scale expansion overseas (international still incurred a -$46 million adjusted EBITDA loss, or a -14% adjusted EBITDA loss margin, in Q1; while domestic adjusted EBITDA of $125 million showed a much stronger 5% margin). Key takeaways Needless to say, a lot of unknowns sit on the horizon for Wayfair. The company is banking on both a macro rebound in the furniture category plus strong customer reaction to the company's marketing push and its first foray into physical retail stores. Given the company's messaging that Q2 is returning to growth as well as the leaps that Wayfair has made in adjusted EBITDA, it's hard to bet against this company - but at the same time, we should maintain caution and not bet the farm on this stock.

        "description": "Stellantis brand Lancia has announced the electrically powered Ypsilon HF. The top model, which will deliver 177 kW, will be added to the Ypsilon range in May 2025. The Ypsilon HF is also the forerunner of future high-performance vehicles from Lancia, bearing the abbreviation HF.",
        "content": "The Lancia Ypsilon is a small car based on the Stellantis e-CMP platform, which was presented in . The small Lancia rolls off the production line in Spain together with its sister models, Peugeot e-208 and Opel Corsa Electric. It also adopts the drive technology from these models—i.e., the combination of a 115 kW electric motor and a 54 kWh battery offered in many Stellantis models. The Ypsilon HF, on the other hand, will offer an output of 177 kW. This power level is not entirely new either: , Alfa Romeo presented an e-CMP model with an output of more than 115 kW for the first time. The Alfa Romeo Junior, which was still called the Milano at its world premiere, was announced with 115 and optionally 176 kW of power – Lancia is now talking about one kilowatt more, but it is the same technology. The power is not achieved with an all-wheel drive and a second drive unit on the rear axle, but is a more powerful version of the familiar electric motor from Stellantis-Nidec on the front axle. According to Lancia, the Ypsilon HF can accelerate from a standstill to 100 kph in 5.8 seconds. However, there are changes to the HF beyond the drive. The chassis has been lowered, the track has been widened, and the body will be characterised by “muscular shapes, inspired by the most radical iconic cars that made history for the brand.” Prices for the Ypsilon HF are not yet known – according to the press release, the top model will launch in a year, i.e. May 2025. Alfa Romeo has at least promised its 176 kW version of the Junior for June 2024. The standard Ypsilon at prices starting from 34,900 euros; the market launch in other countries is not yet known. According to the press release, HF versions of the upcoming Gamma and Delta series are also planned, although no details have yet been provided. However, these HF versions do not necessarily have to be purely electric. Alongside the electric Ypsilon HF, Lancia also unveiled the Ypsilon Rally 4 HF, a racing car with which the brand intends to return to rallying. This model is powered by a 1.2-litre three-cylinder engine. Incidentally, the abbreviation HF stands for ‘High Fidelity.’ An exclusive club was founded under this name at the 1960 Geneva Motor Show, whose members had to have bought at least six Lancia cars. Lancia itself has been using the abbreviation for its sports cars since 1963.",

Esta baja médica se encuentra reservada para aquellas que cuentan con un diagnóstico de dismenorrea secundaria, es decir, una menstruación dolorosa asociada a patologías como endometriosis, miomas, adenomiosis u otras dolencias como inflamación pélvica, pólipos endometriales, ovarios poliquísticos o dificultad en la salida de sangre menstrual. Solamente la endometriosis ya afecta a un diez por ciento de las mujeres, lo que son, aproximadamente, 1.700.000 mujeres en España. Aunque de éstas, sólo una cuarta parte son graves, el número de mujeres que podrían acogerse a esta baja médica es muy elevado y, sin embargo, los datos no lo reflejan. Las expertas consultadas señalan al 'infradiagnóstico' y al temor a la discriminación laboral como las causas principales. La norma entró en vigor el 1 de junio de 2023, dentro del marco de la ley del aborto, y la duración del periodo de baja es extendible hasta que los síntomas asociados a la menstruación cesen.

The drama late last night led to Cadiz FC, which played in Spain’s top-flight LaLiga division this season before being relegated, cancelling a trip to El Salvador. The team was heading to the Central American country to play in a tribute friendly match for ex-player Jorge Gonzalez, a Salvadoran professional footballer better known as El Magico or the Magical One and regarded as Cadiz’s best-ever player. The 66-year-old retired striker took part in the 1982 World Cup for his nation and scored nearly 70 goals during his two spells with the Spanish team. The EuroAtlantic Airways flight scheduled to take the footballers across the Atlantic was due to leave Jerez Airport in south-west Spain yesterday morning but take-off ended up being delayed to around 9pm. It had to make an emergency landing in Seville shortly after take-off. A Cadiz FC spokesman said late last night: “The Cadiz FC expedition had to make an emergency landing a few minutes ago at Seville Airport after a mechanical failure on the plane to El Salvador. “Given the circumstances and the airline being unable to find a solution, the trip to El Salvador has been cancelled. “From now on we will work to fulfil our commitment to Jorge 'Magico’ González, El Salvador and the Salvadorans.” Cadiz were due to play against El Salvador’s national team in Thursday’s friendly, following the inauguration of a museum dedicated to their former player hailed as one of the most-skilled footballers ever produced by the Central American country. The match was due to be played at a stadium named after Cadiz’s former star striker. Cadiz FC’s president Manuel Vizcaino admitted moments after the team’s charter plane landed at Seville Airport the players were “in shock.” He said of the incident: “It was scary. \"The situation is what is is and we have to return to Cadiz but we are keen to look for dates when we can be with our Salvadoran friends.\" STAY in the know this summer with The Sun's transfer experts.

        "content": "A Missouri lawmaker has said SNAP benefits need to be curbed as the program has \"ballooned out of control.\" In an opinion piece penned for the , Missouri's 4th District representative Mark Alford said the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( ) is failing to provide nutritious groceries to families and is costing the federal government too much each year. who would otherwise struggle to afford basic groceries to feed themselves. Alford said the ballooning of the program began more than 20 years ago when was in the White House. \"The 2002 farm bill's eligibility expansions, the switch from paper food stamps to EBT cards, the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic all caused the program to balloon far beyond levels or ever envisioned—even going from costing $63.5 billion in 2019 to $145 billion in 2023,\" he wrote. has contacted the U.S. Department of Agriculture via email for clarification on these figures. Alford claimed that since then, state governments have been allowed to \"abuse their power\" as well as \"evade the reasonable requirements\" put in place to ensure that \"able-bodied adult SNAP recipients without dependents don't take advantage of the current system.\" While funds are provided by the federal government, the management and distribution of SNAP benefits are left to state and local authorities, meaning eligibility thresholds vary from state to state. His comments come as , which will reauthorize the program if passed later this year. Both and have the nation's largest food benefit. Alford said that despite the expanding costs of the program \"we have seen no evidence of SNAP helping to provide a healthier lifestyle\" for its recipients, writing that the U.S. \"adult obesity rate has risen from 15 percent in the late 1970s to 42 percent today.\" He wrote: \"SNAP recipients have even higher obesity rates than low-income nonrecipients.\" has contacted Alford's office via email outside of normal working hours. Alford argued in favor of the Republican's \"pro-WASH\" measures included in its proposals for the Farm Bill—\"pro-work, pro-accountability, pro-sustenance and pro-health.\" Republican proposals include updating work training programs and changing income eligibility rules for young people. The Republican advocated for the creation of an \"office of program integrity\" at the USDA to tackle SNAP overpayments, which Alford claimed is costing the federal government $34 million \"every single day\" and $13.15 billion each year. \"With these changes, we would not cut nor decrease SNAP benefits.

The small city on the southern edge of the Gaza Strip had been sheltering more than a million Palestinians who fled Israeli assaults on other parts of the enclave. Since early May, Israel's military has been carrying out what it says is a limited operation in Rafah to kill fighters and dismantle infrastructure used by Hamas, which runs Gaza. It has told civilians to go to an \"expanded humanitarian zone\" some 20 km (12 miles) away. Many Palestinians have complained they are vulnerable to Israeli attacks wherever they go and have been moving up and down the Gaza Strip in the past few months. UNRWA said the flight from Rafah \"happened with nowhere safe to go and amidst bombardments, lack of food and water, piles of waste and unsuitable living conditions.\" Providing assistance and protection is becoming nearly \"impossible\", the agency said.

        "description": "President Marcos will meet with Senate President Escudero and Speaker Romualdez to discuss efforts to amend the 1987 Constitution, said Rep. Erwin Tulfo.",
        "content": "President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. will meet with Senate President Francis Escudero and Speaker Martin Romualdez to discuss efforts to amend the 1987 Constitution and priority measures, House Deputy Majority Leader and ACT-CIS party-list lawmaker Erwin Tulfo said Tuesday. “Before the Speaker left [for abroad], I was advised na magkakaroon sila ng meeting... with the President, the Senate President, the Speaker. At isa sa mga agenda iyang Charter change (Cha-cha),” Tulfo, the spokesperson for the majority coalition in the House of Representatives, told reporters. Romualdez joined the President’s delegation during the Chief Executive’s visit to Brunei and, later in the week, Singapore. “I don’t know where they will arrive [in terms of an agreement on Cha-cha], but isa ‘yan sa mga pag-uusapan. At saka iyong coordination between the Senate and the House in terms of the priority bills of the President,” Tulfo added. Senate President Escudero, who was elected to his post just a week ago in a swift coup that ousted Senator Miguel Zubiri as Senate leader, had earlier said that he continued to be against Cha-cha and the effort to amend the economic provisions of the Constitution by allowing more foreign ownership of industries such as education, advertising, and public utilities. Escudero argued that the Senate's Resolution of Both Houses (RBH) 6 and the House's RBH 7 were unclear on how members of Congress would vote on Charter change. RBH 6 provides for separate voting, while RBH 7 provides for voting of all members of Congress. Senators were concerned that the Cha-cha voting procedure would steamroll over the 24-member Senate given that the House had 300 members. While the Senate under Zubiri held committee hearings on RBH 6, led by Subcommittee Chairperson Sonny Angara, Escudero said he was still against Charter change since the pending measures did not provide for clear voting. Additionally, Escudero said that the amended Public Services Act law, which reclassified certain public utilities as public services eligible for foreign ownership over 40%, already covered the proposed economic amendments. “For economic provisions, we already have a law for that and it is the weightiest measure pending before the Supreme Court. Once the Supreme Court resolves it, we won’t have that problem [of restricted foreign ownership],” Escudero said. Meanwhile, asked if the meeting of the country’s top leaders would eventually convince Senators to support Cha-cha, Tulfo said, “It depends on the President if he will say that this is important and we need it for investments.” — DVM, GMA Integrated News",

        "description": "A Windhoek High Court judge has ordered social activist Michael Amushelelo to pay Namib Mills’ legal costs in a case about threats to shut the food-producing company down, made by Amushelelo. In a judgement delivered yesterday, judge Hannelie Prinsloo said Amushelelo made inflammatory statements against Namib Mills on social media and his threats can potentially [...]The post Amushelelo ordered to pay Namib Mills’ legal costs appeared first on The Namibian.",
        "content": "In a judgement delivered yesterday, judge Hannelie Prinsloo said Amushelelo made inflammatory statements against Namib Mills on social media and his threats can potentially incite criminal acts. The judge noted that Amushelelo’s statements on social media drew responses in which people threatened to sabotage and loot Namib Mills trucks and to damage the company’s products. Prinsloo said freedom of speech is a cornerstone of Namibian society, but freedom of speech that conflicts with other fundamental rights and leads to unlawful or criminal conduct is in violation of the Constitution. Prinsloo confirmed an interim interdict that she issued on 2 April, and ordered that Amushelelo should pay Namib Mills’ legal costs in the matter. The interdict issued by the court prevents Amushelelo and a group of 26 people working at Namib Mills from unlawfully blocking entrances to the company’s premises in Windhoek and at Otavi, Ondangwa, Katima Mulilo, Walvis Bay and Keetmanshoop. They may also not disrupt or interfere with the normal business operations of Namib Mills, threaten to shut down its operations and make other threats against the company if Namib Mills does not comply with demands made by them, the court’s interdict states. Namib Mills applied for the interdict after Amushelelo blocked the entrance to one of the company’s depots in Windhoek on 11 March. He also posted messages on social media in which he declared war on the company. Prinsloo recorded in her judgement that Amushelelo and Namib Mills have had a number of prior confrontations that started in 2022. In March this year, Amushelelo placed a “stern warning” to Namib Mills on his Facebook account, cautioning the company to be prepared for serious retaliation and consequences if it dismissed some of the employees alleged to have been involved in theft. He signed that message in his capacity as general secretary of the National Union of Retail Industry Workers of Namibia, which is not officially registered and with which Namib Mills does not have a recognition agreement. After making more threats against Namib Mills on social media, Amushelelo and a group of Namib Mills staff members blocked the entrance to a company depot in Windhoek on 11 March, preventing deliveries to the depot for about three hours. Namib Mills reacted by filing an urgent application in the High Court against Amushelelo, the Namibia Economic Freedom Fighters, of which Amushelelo is a member, the National Union of Retail Industry Workers of Namibia, six Namib Mills employees and 20 employees of a labour hire company contracted to do work for Namib Mills. Prinsloo noted in her judgement that Amushelelo claimed Namib Mills was engaging in unfair labour practices. She added: “These complaints by the employees can and should be addressed by the relevant authorities. In this context, I am referring to the Office of the Labour Commissioner.” She said Amushelelo and the workers who joined him in blocking access to the depot clearly interfered with the company’s right to conduct business without unwarranted interference. Taking the law into one’s own hands “is fundamentally inconsistent with the rule of law”, Prinsloo said. Amushelelo made no secret of what his agenda was regarding Namib Mills, Prinsloo said. “He declared war on [Namib Mills] in as many words, not only on social media but also before this court.” A final interdict against Amushelelo would not be a “gag order” for him and his cause, but would oblige him to operate within the confines of the law, the judge said. Amushelelo and the other respondents in the matter did not have legal representation. Namib Mills was represented by legal counsel Natasha Bassingthwaighte, instructed by Jaco Boltman.",

        "description": "Narwal, who was the assistant coach under former coach Rambir Singh Khokar, has been promoted to the role of head coach ahead of Pro Kabaddi League season 11.",
        "content": "Dabang Delhi K.C. has appointed Joginder Narwal as its new Head Coach ahead of the Pro Kabaddi League Season 11. Narwal, a PKL winner with Dabang Delhi K.C. in season 6, is excited for the challenge that lies ahead, he revealed after his promotion from assistant coach to head coach. “It feels amazing to become the Head Coach of the team, especially because I played for the Delhi team. I have been with this team for quite some time. In Season 10, our team did very well, but unfortunately, we couldn’t win it. Hopefully we have a bright future,” said Narwal. The former defender spoke about the transition from player to coach, having gained experience in both roles in the PKL, “There are a lot of differences between being a coach and a player in this sport. As a coach, all I can do is tell my player what to do so that they can improve themselves, but as a player, I could affect the result on the mat. This is how the game works – the coach can only give advice; it is the player who has to execute it to perfection.” Ashu Malik and Joginder Narwal (r).| Photo Credit:Special Arrangement The Dabang Delhi K.C. missed out on a spot in the semifinals after a close fight with Patna Pirates in Eliminator 1 in the recently-concluded Season 10. Sharing his team’s preparations ahead of the new season, Narwal said, “Most players continue their training during their off-season. They work hard and also participate in local tournaments for their respective domestic teams when the season is not in session. I also have a lot of youngsters who practice with me so I help them with their training.” With the PKL returning to the previous format of playing across all the 12 home cities in Season 10, Narwal spoke about the advantages of the same, “Returning to the old format was exciting but also challenging. All the teams got to play in front of their fans. The weather conditions and environment changes with each location and every team had to adapt to that. However, it was important for the players to have an experience of travelling to all 12 cities.” Comments Related stories Related Topics",

        "content": "Over the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has moved from being a buzzword to becoming central to modern technology. It has revolutionized industries with its ability to process vast amounts of data, learn from patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. From enhancing medical diagnostics to automating complex manufacturing processes , AI is the driving force behind innovation and efficiency across the globe. However, traditional AI systems face significant challenges, such as data privacy concerns , lack of transparency and susceptibility to tampering . These issues highlight the need for a more secure, transparent and decentralized approach to AI deployment and execution. Enter the Internet Computer, which aims to address these challenges by leveraging the power of blockchain and smart contracts. The Internet Computer review delves into the fundamental components of ICP, starting with its decentralized and tamper-resistant environment for AI models. We will discuss how its high-performance smart contracts provide an efficient and transparent platform for running complex applications. The scalability of ICP is explored through its subnet architecture and asynchronous messaging system, which ensures efficient and secure execution of smart contracts.

In addition, we also have an article where we discuss blockchain technology and AI’s potential impact on various industries. What is Internet Computer? The Internet Computer Protocol offers a solution to the challenges of traditional AI. It offers a decentralized approach that leverages the power of smart contracts. Here’s how ICP addresses these issues: Decentralization and Integrity: ICP’s vision of replacing traditional software with smart contracts aligns with the goal of decentralizing AI. By running AI models as smart contracts on the ICP blockchain, the tampering problem can be mitigated. Smart contracts on ICP benefit from high performance, allowing them to utilize significant computational resources while ensuring the integrity of their execution. Unlike traditional AI systems vulnerable to tampering, smart contracts on ICP provide a transparent and tamper-resistant environment for running AI algorithms. Transparency and Accountability: The decentralized nature of ICP addresses the black box problem by providing transparency into how AI models operate. Users can interact with AI smart contracts directly through a browser interface, eliminating the need for specialized software or intermediary platforms. This transparency enables users to understand how their data is used and how AI decisions are made, fostering trust in the technology. Additionally, developers have the flexibility to write smart contracts using familiar languages like Rust, TypeScript, or Python, making it easier to audit and understand the underlying code. In addition, ICP offers several key features that make it well-suited for decentralized AI: High-performance smart contracts: Smart contracts on ICP can utilize significant computational resources, enabling the deployment of complex AI models with unprecedented speed and efficiency. Low cost and resource efficiency: ICP is designed to be cost-effective and environmentally friendly, making it accessible for a wide range of applications, including AI. State-of-the-art user experience: Users can interact with AI smart contracts using just a browser, simplifying the user experience and removing barriers to adoption. Interoperability: ICP can interface with other smart contract blockchains and traditional web resources, facilitating seamless integration with existing AI ecosystems and data sources. Developer-friendly: Developers can write smart contracts using popular languages and incorporate libraries from their respective ecosystems, making it easier to build and deploy AI applications on ICP. The Internet Computer aspires to evolve into a “World Computer” offering an open and secure public blockchain network accessible to everyone for hosting their smart contracts securely. The DFINITY Foundation is a major contributor to the Internet Computer blockchain. What Makes ICP Smart Contracts So Special? In the context of ICP, smart contracts are referred to as “canisters.” Canisters are computational units within ICP that combine code and data. They are versatile, and capable of performing various tasks, from serving web pages to implementing complex applications like secure messaging apps or decentralized token exchanges. Canisters represent a significant advancement from traditional smart contracts, offering enhanced capabilities and versatility. They ensure tamper-proof execution, where modifications to their state are exclusively facilitated through on-chain messages. This process guarantees auditable and cryptographically verified states, fostering trust and security within the system. In the realm of computational models, canisters exhibit similarities to actors within the actor model of computation. Responding to messages, canisters dynamically modify their private state, communicate with other canisters by sending messages, and even generate additional canisters as needed. This inherent concurrency feature effectively addresses scalability challenges often encountered in conventional smart contract platforms, enabling efficient and flexible execution. Moreover, in terms of behaviour, canisters operate akin to operating system processes. ICP orchestrates their execution, while canisters maintain states resembling how operating systems manage processes. Although canisters cannot directly alter certain aspects of their state, such as cycle balance, ICP furnishes essential APIs for functions like payments and messaging, ensuring seamless operation and interaction within the ecosystem. Implemented as WebAssembly modules, canisters offer unparalleled interoperability, allowing developers to write them in various languages compatible with WebAssembly. This approach facilitates integration with existing systems and frameworks, enhancing development flexibility and accessibility. Furthermore, canisters’ memory employs orthogonal persistence, transparently storing data across executions and ensuring its continuous availability, thereby optimizing resource utilization and user experience. Internet Computer Architecture The Internet Computer represents a revolutionary approach to blockchain-based platforms, aiming to securely host and execute smart contracts at scale. Its architecture is a departure from traditional blockchain protocols, integrating lessons learned from past projects to address scalability concerns. Resource Management with Cycles Canisters utilize cycles, acquired with the ICP utility token, to pay for the resources they consume. This approach shifts the burden of transaction fees away from end-users, adhering to a “reverse gas” model. With this model, canisters can efficiently manage resources and execute complex tasks without imposing additional costs on users. Subnets The IC’s scalability and efficiency are facilitated by its subnet-based architecture. Subnetworks, or subnets, operate independently and concurrently, each hosting a set of canisters. With nodes replicating all canisters, states, and computations within a subnet, the IC achieves a secure and fault-tolerant environment. New subnets can be created dynamically to scale out the protocol, ensuring limitless scalability. Asynchronous Messaging and Loose Coupling Canisters communicate through asynchronous messaging, allowing for loose coupling between different canisters and subnets. This asynchronous communication model, combined with isolated canister states, enables concurrent execution and scalability. In contrast to synchronous communication in most blockchains, this approach is pivotal in achieving unprecedented scalability while ensuring security and fault tolerance. Core Internet Computer Protocol Each subnet is driven by the core Internet Computer Protocol, comprising layers such as peer-to-peer, consensus, message routing, and execution. This protocol operates on all nodes within a subnet, driving consensus and message execution independently. Chain-key and chain-evolution technologies underpin various aspects of the protocol, ensuring decentralized operation and long-term sustainability. The Core Internet Computer Protocol The Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) underpins the operation of the Internet Computer, from which its utility token, the ICP token, derives its name. The core IC protocol is a multi-layered architecture running on nodes within each subnet. This protocol enables the creation of blockchain-based replicated state machines, which make progress independently across subnets while maintaining asynchronous communication. The core IC protocol consists of four layers: Peer-to-peer: Handles communication between nodes and facilitates message exchange. Consensus: Establishes agreement on the ordering and selection of incoming messages, providing them in block format to the upper layers. Message routing: Receives ordered messages from the consensus layer and routes them for execution. Execution: Executes messages in a deterministic manner on every node within the subnet, ensuring consistency in state transitions. We’ll now explore these in detail. Peer to peer The peer-to-peer layer is like the system that helps computers talk to each other. When you want to send something to another computer on the network, like a message or a request for information, the peer-to-peer layer helps make sure it gets there reliably and securely. It does this by using something called a gossip protocol, where each computer shares what it knows with a few other computers nearby, and those computers share it with more, until eventually, everyone has the information they need. To make sure the network doesn’t get overwhelmed with too much information, each computer doesn’t send the actual message to everyone. Instead, it sends a small message called an “advert” to just a few other computers, telling them what the message is about. Then, if another computer needs that message, it can ask one of the computers that got the advert for it. Also, some messages are more important than others, so the peer-to-peer layer makes sure those important messages get sent out quickly, while less important ones might take a bit longer. Lastly, to keep everything safe, computers in the network only talk to other computers that belong to the same group, which is managed by a special system called the Network Nervous System. This helps prevent bad actors from causing trouble. Consensus The Consensus layer of the Internet Computer is like the referee in a game, making sure all the players agree on what’s happening and when. Here’s how it works: Round Setup: Each subnet, which is like a group of computers in the Internet Computer network, has its own game to play. In each round, these computers, called nodes, work together to agree on the next set of actions, like which messages to process. Block Making: Imagine one node as the team captain. This node gathers all the messages from the previous round and proposes a plan for the next round, which is called a “block.” The plan is then shared with all the other nodes. Notarization: Once the other nodes get the plan, they check it to make sure it’s valid. If it looks good, they give it a stamp of approval called “notarization.” For the plan to move forward, at least two-thirds of the nodes need to agree. Finalization: After a plan gets enough stamps of approval, it’s considered “finalized.” This means everyone agrees it’s the right plan, and it’s time to move on to the next round. To make sure everything runs smoothly, the system has a few tricks up its sleeves: Random Beacon: To decide who gets to be the team captain for each round, the system uses a random number generator called a “random beacon.” This ensures fairness and prevents anyone from cheating. Fault Tolerance: Even if some nodes are slow or make mistakes, the system keeps going. As long as most of the nodes are honest and agree, the game can continue without interruption. Message Prioritization: Some messages are more important than others, so the system makes sure those get processed first. This helps keep things moving efficiently. Message Routing Message Routing is like the postal service of the Internet Computer, making sure messages are delivered accurately and efficiently between canisters (smart contracts), even across different parts of the network. It’s a crucial component that ensures the smooth operation and synchronization of the entire system. It’s responsible for several key tasks: Induction: Processing messages received from the Consensus layer and preparing them for execution. Execution Invocation: Triggering the Execution layer to process the messages. Routing: Directing messages between canisters within and across subnets. State Certification: Ensuring the accuracy of the subnet’s state. State Synchronization: Assisting nodes in staying updated by syncing their state with the latest subnet state. Messages are processed by extracting them from blocks received from Consensus and queuing them up for execution. The Execution layer then schedules and executes these messages in a deterministic manner, meaning the same actions are taken on every node of the subnet. Messages can modify the state of canisters and create new messages for other canisters, either within the same subnet or across different subnets. Execution The Execution layer is like the conductor of an orchestra, coordinating the actions of all the parts to create harmony. Here’s what it does in simple terms: Running Canister Programs: Imagine each smart contract (canister) as a little program running on the Internet Computer. The Execution layer is responsible for running these programs. It makes sure they run correctly and don’t interfere with each other. Keeping Things Consistent: Just like everyone in a dance class needs to do the same steps at the same time, the Execution layer ensures that all the copies of a smart contract running on different computers reach the same state after processing the same messages. This makes sure the system works properly and is fair to everyone using it. Handling Different Types of Messages: There are different kinds of messages that can be sent to smart contracts. Some are like regular mail, while others are like urgent messages that need immediate attention. The Execution layer makes sure each message gets to the right place and is dealt with appropriately. Dealing with Big Tasks: Sometimes, tasks are too big to finish in one go. Just like doing a big project over several days, the Execution layer can pause a task at the end of one round and continue it in the next. This way, nothing gets left unfinished, and the system stays running smoothly. Keeping Things Secure: It’s important that everything is done safely and securely. The Execution layer makes sure that only the right things happen and that no one can cheat the system. ICP As A Bitcoin Layer 2 Bitcoin integration on the Internet Computer enables canister smart contracts to interact directly with the Bitcoin network in a trustless manner, offering new opportunities for DApps. Two main challenges were overcome to make this possible: Protocol-Level Integration: The IC was integrated with the Bitcoin network at a protocol level, allowing it to fetch Bitcoin blocks and process transactions. This integration maintains the full Bitcoin UTXO set on the IC, letting canisters query UTXO sets and balances. Chain-Key ECDSA Signatures: Canisters (smart contracts) can now hold ECDSA keys using a novel chain-key ECDSA signature protocol suite. This allows them to send and receive Bitcoin, create transactions, and request threshold ECDSA signatures for spending UTXOs. Bitcoin Integration Components The Bitcoin integration involves several key components and processes that enable direct interaction with the Bitcoin network: BTC Canister: A Bitcoin-activated subnet includes a BTC canister, managed as a regular NNS (Network Nervous System) Wasm canister. This canister holds on-chain Bitcoin-related data, including the UTXO set, recent Bitcoin blocks for fork resolution, and outgoing transactions. Bitcoin Adapter: At the networking layer, a Bitcoin adapter process connects to Bitcoin network nodes, functioning like a regular Bitcoin node. Maintaining the UTXO Set: The BTC canister and adapter communicate via ICP’s protocol stack. The BTC canister requests new blocks from the adapter, which retrieves them from the Bitcoin network. The canister validates these blocks, processes transactions, updates the UTXO set, and handles unstable blocks for fork resolution and balance queries. Submitting Transactions: Canisters use the management canister API to submit Bitcoin transactions, which are queued for submission to the Bitcoin network. The adapters in each subnet replica handle the asynchronous submission of these transactions, ensuring efficient and quick distribution across multiple Bitcoin network nodes. Current Projects ICDex: This is a 100% on-chain order-book-based decentralized exchange running on the Internet Computer. Using ICP’s native Bitcoin integration, you can buy ICP using your BTC. ICDex also supports ICRC-1, which allows users to trade SNS tokens. Funded: Web3’s alternative to Kickstarter, Funded runs 100% on the Internet Computer and uses NFTs to provide ‘”proof of ownership” in the projects you help crowdfund. Like a project? You can fund it in ICP and BTC. DSCVR: This is an end-to-end decentralized Web3 social media platform that allows communities to form into groups called Portals. These Portals can be NFT gated, airdrop fungible and non-fungible tokens to their members and much more. DSCVR also allows for tipping posts in a growing number of cryptos, including ckBTC. Chain-key Bitcoin (ckBTC) is a token on the Internet Computer that is backed 1:1 by Bitcoin such that 1 ckBTC can always be redeemed for 1 BTC and vice versa. OpenChat: OpenChat is a decentralized real-time messaging service that lives 100% on the blockchain. It allows people to send crypto to their friends — including Bitcoin with TX fees at only $0.0029 and OpenChat’s own governance token, CHAT. ICP Ethereum Integration Internet Computer integrates with Ethereum and other EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) chains through its Chain Fusion Technology, which eliminates the need for a single trusted intermediary. This integration is powered by two key components: decentralized bi-directional communication with other chains and the ability of ICP smart contracts to sign and submit transactions to these chains. Chain fusion enhances non-ICP smart contracts and DApps by incorporating ICP’s capabilities. This includes a Web2-like user experience, where interactions with ICP smart contracts are low-cost, fast, and simple, resembling traditional web services. This allows users to engage with smart contracts using a standard browser without needing a crypto wallet. Before we move any further, here’s a neat table courtesy of ICP: Key Features: Threshold Signing Services: ICP smart contracts can use threshold ECDSA signing, enabling them to sign Ethereum transactions securely. Oracles and DAO Frameworks: Access to real-time data and decentralized autonomous organization frameworks. Privacy Tools and Pass Key Authentication: Enhanced security and authentication features. Smart Contract Wallets and Reverse Gas Fees: Efficient wallet functionalities and gasless transactions. ICP highlights the benefits of this integration, which include increased liquidity and market access, improved scalability and throughput for Ethereum dApps, and the ability to fully decentralize Ethereum DApps by hosting data on ICP. Users can perform gasless token swaps with ckETH and ckERC-20 tokens, enjoying minimal fees and fast transactions. Additionally, ICP connects smart contracts to real-world data through Web2 integration, enabling practical swaps with low fees and quick finality using ckTokens. Ethereum Projects on ICP Here’s a sampling of ETH projects on Internet Computer: Bitfinity is an EVM that allows user to deploy smart contracts written in Solidity on the IC. Masquerade (MSQ) is a Matamask Snap-based wallet. zCloak network is developing a chain abstraction-based Zero Knowledge coprocessor on the IC. Helix Markets is a hybrid spot orderbook DEX developed on the Internet Computer protocol. ICP Token The ICP token serves multiple roles within the Internet Computer Protocol. As a governance token, it can be staked to exercise governance rights. As a utility token, it can be burned to obtain “cycles,” which act as gas for computation and storage in canister smart contracts. Additionally, ICP tokens can be minted to reward node machine providers for supplying compute and storage resources. Beyond these core functions, ICP tokens are used in decentralization swaps to become co-owners of SNS DAOs and in various smart contract services like registries, marketplaces and exchanges. The ICP token adheres to the ICRC-1 standard. The ICP token utility includes: Participate in Governance: ICP token holders can stake their tokens in neurons with a dissolve delay greater than six months to vote on governance proposals and earn rewards. They can also submit proposals to change the protocol. The Network Nervous System (NNS), the largest DAO managing an L1 blockchain, oversees this governance system, which currently has over 250 million locked ICP. Burn for Cycles: In the Internet Computer’s “Reverse Gas Model,” developers pay for computation and storage by topping up smart contracts with cycles, allowing users to interact with DApps without needing tokens, similar to Web2 applications. Reward Node Machine Providers: ICP tokens are minted to reward those who provide the necessary compute and storage infrastructure. Participate in the Ecosystem: ICP tokens can be stored in wallets, swapped on decentralized exchanges, used to collect NFTs, or for tipping friends in chats. The Internet Computer hosts a growing ecosystem of DApps utilizing ICP. Where To Buy ICP Token If you’re looking to buy ICP, you can do so via Binance , Coinbase , Bybit and OKX , among many others. Also, check out our ranking of the best crypto exchanges . There aren’t many decentralized exchanges where you can buy ICP with Sonic and ICPSwap as the only two options. Internet Computer Review: Closing Thoughts The Internet Computer Protocol offers a decentralized platform that efficiently hosts and executes smart contracts at scale. By addressing the limitations of traditional AI and blockchain systems, ICP leverages smart contracts to ensure transparency, integrity, and efficiency in decentralized applications. Key strengths of ICP include its ability to provide a tamper-resistant environment for AI models and other applications, fostering security and trust through transparent operations. The high-performance smart contracts, known as canisters, can handle significant computational resources, enabling the deployment of complex AI models with remarkable speed and efficiency. ICP’s cost-effective and environmentally friendly design, coupled with a user-friendly experience, allows users to interact with smart contracts directly through their browsers. Its interoperability with other smart contract blockchains and traditional web resources facilitates seamless integration with existing ecosystems. All in all, ICP is a versatile platform that addresses critical issues in traditional AI and blockchain systems while paving the way for a more secure, transparent and efficient digital ecosystem.

        "description": "Harmeet was touted to be the next great Indian spinner, but that did not materialize for one reason or another. Some unfortunate events in his career eventually prompted him to quit Indian cricket and move to the United States of America in September 2020.",
        "content": "Harmeet Singh was recognized as a childhood prodigy when the legendary left-arm spinner Padmakar Shivalkar discovered his talent at the tender age of nine in Mumbai. His skills as a left-arm spinner caught the eye of cricket icons, with the late Dilip Sardesai and former Australian great Ian Chappell comparing him to the late Bishan Singh Bedi. At that young age, Harmeet shone brightly in the Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand in 2010. However, it was his stellar performance in the 2012 Under-19 World Cup in Australia, where India clinched the trophy, that made his presence felt in the cricket world. Harmeet was touted to be the next great Indian spinner, but that did not materialize for one reason or another. Some unfortunate events in his career eventually prompted him to quit Indian cricket and move to the United States of America in September 2020. It was a fresh start for a cricketer who held so much talent. Landing in the USA, Harmeet hoped to re-establish and redefine his cricket career. The USA, a land of opportunity and a melting pot of cultures, gave him a fresh start. He made a career choice to pursue cricket full-time. He joined Seattle Thunderbolts in Minor League Cricket (MiLC), an organization in its infancy, hoping to bolster cricket in the United States. He became his team’s hero in Seattle, leading to more contracts with Major League Cricket (MLC), where he was drafted No. 1 during the inaugural season of MLC. Playing for Seattle Orcas with coach Praveen Amre, Harmeet excelled, and his team reached the finals in the 2023 season. While in India, his opportunities were very few, with one match for Rajasthan Royals franchise in 2013. He never settled with one Ranji Trophy team long term, sharing his few outings with Mumbai, Jammu & Kashmir, and Tripura. Frustration built up with his pent-up emotions, finally leading him to leave India for the USA. Now, in the USA, his stock rose exponentially with his bowling prowess and also with the bat. He has turned out to be an all-rounder, and in the first T20I against Bangladesh held recently in Texas, he scored an all-important 33 runs off 13 balls, eventually earning him the Player of the Match. Harmeet has worked diligently on his batting and continued to improve and innovate. Harmeet was integral to USA cricket’s success against Canada and Bangladesh. This augurs well for the host nation in Group A for the T20 ICC World Cup that the USA and the West Indies jointly host. While speaking with , Harmeet said, “I am just judged on my playing cricket. After coming from India, I kept my actions the same. In America, I have climbed ladders. That is what is making me eager to perform better. It has allowed me to get all the negativity out. Other team members of the World Cup in India had played several First-Class games. My home state gave me about nine matches. I could not have done anything better. Now, I am very determined to play, and I do not have the uncertainty of whether I will be selected.” Harmeet further added, “For me, it is all about his mindset. Coming with a neutral mindset and going with utmost confidence matters for me. How my body language is, and how well I performed. I don’t worry about the results. Everyone likes a five-wicket haul, but how you approach the game matters. The main thing is what matters besides how you play and how helpful you are to your teammates. With Stuart Law, Team USA’s new Head Coach, we have had good experiences. He is an easy-going guy but aggressive on the ground. Coach Law approaches the game by allowing the guys to play with freedom. This is helping the team.” Reflecting on his journey, Harmeet said, “I will prove it to the world. Now, I want to prove myself. I always belonged there at the highest level. I aim to go out, play to my best potential, and showcase myself.” Harmeet’s World Cup journey starts in Texas on June 1.

Al menos por ahora, ya que el Tribunal Administrativo Central de Recursos Contractuales (TACRC), un órgano administrativo del Ministerio de Hacienda , ha rechazado la adjudicación realizada el pasado 18 de enero a MBS Ciudad de la Luz S.L., perteneciente a la multinacional estadounidense MBS Group (detrás de producciones como Avatar 2 o The Mandalorian ), por falta de solvencia técnica. El rechazo se produce al estimar parcialmente este tribunal un recurso presentado por otra de las empresas candidatas (Roots Asset Management S.L.-Drago Broadcast Services S.L., que representa a la española Secuoya, que quedó en segundo lugar) sobre «falta de solvencia técnica de la adjudicataria», por lo que establece la « exclusión del procedimiento» de MBS. A su vez, el TACRC ordena «el levantamiento de la suspensión del procedimiento de contratación», suspendida automáticamente con la interposición del recurso, por lo que ahora la Generalitat, a través de la Sociedad de Proyectos para la Transformación Digital (SPTD), estudia cómo continuar con el mecanismo de adjudicación: si debe dejar paso a la segunda propuesta con mayor puntuación –la misma que ha recurrido la adjudicación– o rehace o revisa el procedimiento para elegir al futuro gestor de Ciudad de la Luz. La resolución, no obstante, no altera ni la agenda ni la actividad en el complejo cinematogáficro y audiovisual alicantino, que lleva a cabo la Sociedad de Proyectos para la Transformación Digital desde su reapertura, primero bajo el anterior gobierno del Botànic y ahora con el que preside Carlos Mazón . Por último, la resolución es definitiva en la vía administrativa y contra la misma cabe recurso contencioso-administrativo ante la Sala de lo Contencioso-administrativo del Tribunal Superior de Justicia de la Comunitat Valenciana , en el plazo de dos meses, a contar desde el día siguiente al de la recepción de esta notificación, fechada el pasado 11 de abril. Fuentes del Consell han apuntado desconocer si MBS ha decidido presentar contencioso-administrativo y, por su parte, la Generalitat estudia la resolución «desde el punto de vista jurídico para ver cómo seguir con la adjudicación». Antecedentes El contrato en cuestión se había adjudicado el 18 de enero de 2024 a MBS Ciudad de la Luz S.L. por cinco años por un importe de 3.100.000 euros (IVA no incluido) y con un porcentaje de comercialización para la sociedad del 6,5%. A la convocatoria para adjudicar los «Servicios profesionales de un equipo de gestión operativa y comercialización del complejo industrial audiovisual Ciudad de la Luz para la producción audiovisual y otros» se presentaron seis ofertas –después de un recurso en el pliego de condiciones, que hubo de redactarse de nuevo– y la de MBS fue la mejor valorada. Todo este proceso se llevó a cabo por el anterior Gobierno, a excepción de la elección de la empresa. El 8 de febrero se presentó el recurso de Secuoya que pedía la anulación del procedimiento de licitación basándose en cinco argumentaciones, de las que el Tribunal Administrativo Central de Recursos Contractuales ha estimado una –la relativa a la falta de solvencia técnica– y ha rechazado las otras cuatro, relativas a supuesta arbitrariedad, modificación de integrantes del órgano de valoración y falta de acceso al expediente. Sin equipo propio El punto de conflicto –los requisitos de solvencia exigida – se incumplía, a juicio de la empresa recurrente, al indicar que se integraban con «medios externos en su totalidad», ya que «la solvencia económica se aporta por una empresa que no presenta declaración responsable, vulnerando las previsiones legales sobre el particular». Otro incumplimiento, alegaban, era que la licitadora no contaba con un equipo propio de comercialización y que la empresa no había tenido ningún tipo de actividad económica en el último año. A ello respondió la SPTD que la empresa adjudicataria (MBS Ciudad de la Luz S.L.) «es una sociedad española perteneciente a un grupo de sociedades nacionales e internacionales y que dispondrá durante todo el tiempo de duración del contrato de la solvencia y medios de las sociedades del grupo», es decir, que «integra su solvencia con medios internos de las empresas del grupo al que pertenece». En este sentido, aportaba un contrato con MBS Equipment UK Ltd de prestación directa a través de sus filiales y matrices, de medios y solvencia a MBS Ciudad de la Luz S.L. durante el contrato, respondiendo de forma solidaria. El tribunal interpreta, sin embargo, que «los pliegos consideran la comercialización como una tarea crítica e impone sea ejecutada por la empresa licitadora y con medios propios de esta», por lo que estima esta parte el recurso «por no disponer la adjudicataria de un equipo de comercialización propio y, por tanto, no reunir la solvencia técnica exigida, siendo procedente su exclusión del procedimiento». Reacciones El portavoz del PSPV-PSOE en Las Cortes, José Muñoz, según recoge Europa Press, ha denunciado que «los tribunales han tumbado otra operación oscura del Consell» y censura que «los manejos del Consell permitieron primar la subjetividad en la valoración de las ofertas». «Ahora nos encontramos con un varapalo que pone en tela de juicio la objetividad del PP en la gestión de los recursos públicos», ha lamentado. Fuentes de la Conselleria de Innovación , a su vez, han criticado «la ignorancia y la irresponsabilidad» del PSPV- PSOE por su interpretación del fallo de Ciudad de la Luz y han sostenido que fue el anterior Consell quien inició este concurso. En este sentido, han aseverado que la resolución « no pone en duda el procedimiento , el comité técnico o la clasificación», pero acepta el recurso al considerar que la compañía «no acredita que disponga de un equipo comercializador propio». «Se trata de una cuestión técnica , pero parece que el señor Muñoz necesita levantar sospechas sobre un procedimiento que además inició el Gobierno del Botànic», han reprochado desde el departamento que dirige Nuria Montes, que cree que debería felicitar al actual equipo de Ciudad de la Luz por su gestión y por el ritmo de producciones que están consiguiendo atraer.

        "content": "Katie Price has been branded 'disappointing' after she was accused of 'egging on' her son Harvey to say the C-word during a live podcast recording on Monday night. Get the latest entertainment news sent straight to your inbox with our weekly Showbiz newsletter We have more newsletters Get the latest entertainment news sent straight to your inbox with our weekly Showbiz newsletter We have more newsletters Katie Price has been slammed for her \"shocking and disappointing\" antics during a stage show with her son Harvey. The ex-glamour model, aged 46, graced the stage at The Clapham Grand alongside her sister Sophie as part of their 'The Katie Price Show' podcast tour. They were accompanied by 22-year-old Harvey , who was reportedly egged on to repeatedly utter the C-word in front of a packed audience. This wasn't the first instance of Harvey using the expletive; he famously let it slip live on Loose Women in 2016. In that notorious episode, Katie prompted him with the question: \"Harvey, if someone says something horrible to you. What do you say? \" To which he infamously replied: \"Hello, you c***\". At Monday night's event, it's claimed that Katie encouraged Harvey to repeat the C-word by alluding to the previous occasion he had said it. Harvey, who is visually impaired, autistic, suffers from septo-optic dysplasia, and has learning difficulties, was asked by his celebrity mother: \"What was the naughty word when you were on TV with Piers Morgan? What did you say?\" To this, Harvey responded: \"Hi Piers Morgan you bl***y c***.\", reports the Mirror . It's reported that Katie then handed him the microphone once more, leading to Harvey saying: \"Hello you c***\". One attendee expressed their dismay to the Daily Mail, stating they were \"shocked and disappointed\" by Katie's behaviour. \"I don't know what I was more shocked about, the fact that a mum was egging her son, regardless of his age, to use such a profanity on stage, or the fact that she said 'well done' after he done it,\" they remarked. \"Although the audience were laughing at the time, when we were all walking out, fans were expressing how disappointed they were that Harvey seemed to be used as a prop in the live show for a cheap laugh. Katie appears to be such a fantastic mum, so seeing something like this live is extremely disappointing.\" Katie shares Harvey with her ex Dwight Yorke, and claims the former footballer isn't in their son's life. The mum-of-five previously revealed she was \"mortified\" by the original incident on Loose Women but that she has since learned to see the funny side. She has stressed that she is laughing with Harvey, not at him. However, some famous names weren't so kind about the incident as Katie wrote in her book: \"I was surprised, and saddened, to see that the cricketer Ben Stokes had made fun of Harvey because of it. He publicly mocked him in a Snapchat video in 2017. He was filmed doing an impression of Harvey saying, 'Hello, you c***' and it circulated online.\" He later offered an apology and asked to meet Katie and her family in person to say sorry again, she declined the offer.

Harvey was in celebration mode this week as mum Katie poured her heart out with a loving social media tribute on his birthday. She gave fans a glimpse into their past with a throwback photograph of Harvey and herself, which showed him as a young boy. The heartfelt snap was shared on Instagram stories with the touching caption: \"Happy birthday to my Harvey. Love you sooooo much,\" alongside two frog emojis and white hearts. Katie gushed further about Harvey, describing him as \"my best friend, my everything\" and playfully added a \"ribbit ribbit\" in reference to a frog.

        "content": "Minister on holiday in Greece 'might be designing election campaign literature' says Work and Pensions Secretary - as gloomy Tories admit some MPs have already 'given up' By James Tapsfield, Political Editor For Mailonline Published: 09:32, 28 May 2024 | Updated: 09:36, 28 May 2024 e-mail View comments A Tory minister on holiday in Greece during the election battle could be busy 'designing campaign literature', the Work and Pension Secretary said today. Mel Stride made the suggestion in interviews this morning after Steve Baker defended his absence since Rishi Sunak called the snap ballot for July 4. The Northern Ireland minister complained that the PM had 'told everyone we could go on holiday' before making the announcement, saying he was on a 'much-needed break'. The row has fuelled Tory nerves about the bumpy start to the campaign, with senior MPs warning that disaffected colleagues they need to 'zip it'. 'Some just know they will lose and won't forgive that they have lost another six months as MP,' one veteran backbencher told MailOnline. Mel Stride made the suggestion in interviews this morning after Steve Baker defended his absence since Rishi Sunak called the snap ballot for July 4 Mr Baker complained that the PM had 'told everyone we could go on holiday' before making the announcement, saying he was on a 'much-needed break' Asked last night about the bumpy start to the campaign, the Prime Minister told ITV News: 'Of course this is my responsibility, and I actually enjoyed the last few days.' Asked about Mr Baker - who is defending a majority of just 1,500 in his Wycombe constituency after boundary changes - Mr Stride said: 'What I know is that there are hundreds of Conservative candidates up and down the country pounding pavements...' Pressed that Mr Baker was not pounding pavements, Mr Stride replied: 'I can't comment on what Steve is doing or where he is... maybe he's designing his literature or making telephone calls, I've no idea.' Mr Baker was among those rebuked for a 'lack of co-operation' in a leaked memo from CCHQ. But in a defiant statement last night he told the Mirror: 'The Prime Minister told everyone we could go on holiday and then called a snap election. 'So I've chosen to do my campaign work in Greece.' The Wycombe MP added: 'I've been campaigning for months and my wife deserves to have her husband go away for a much needed break. It's the only holiday we've got planned for the summer.' Asked last night about the bumpy start to the campaign, the Prime Minister told ITV News: 'Of course this is my responsibility, and I actually enjoyed the last few days. 'A few days into this and I've been in the East Midlands and West Midlands, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland here in the South East.' Asked why CCHQ was blaming MPs, Mr Sunak dodged the question: 'What I'm doing is talking to people everywhere, about the choice of this election, and I was very clear that I've got a clear plan that I'm working through and you can see that that is happening with the economy.' Ousted West Mids mayor Andy Street delivered another blow to Mr Sunak by announcing he will not seek to become an MP Tory MP Lucy Allan quit the party last night in order to support a Reform UK candidate to replace her in her Telford constituency. Ms Allan, who is standing down at the general election, endorsed Reform's Alan Adams to succeed her in the Shropshire seat. Following her public declaration of support for Mr Adams, the Conservatives took immediate action and suspended Ms Allan from the party. Meanwhile, ousted West Mids mayor Andy Street delivered another blow to Mr Sunak by announcing he will not seek to become an MP.

        "content": "ابراهیم فیاض در گفت‌وگو با خبرنگار جامعه افزود: ایرانی‌ها مدنیت بسیار عظیمی دارند که در چنین مراسم‌هایی متجلی می‌شود؛ شما حتی در کشوری مانند عراق نیز چنین تشییع باشکوهی را نمی‌بینید. خاطرم هست که در عراق به تشییع پیکر یکی از شهدای مدافع حرم رفته بودم. مراسم خلوت بود و مشایعت‌کنندگان نظامی بودند. وقتی من به عنوان یک فرد غیر نظامی تابوت را همراهی کردم آنها از من تشکر کردند. وی با بیان اینکه مرگ و زندگی پس از آن برای ایرانی ها مفهوم والایی دارد و مهم است، افزود: مناسکی چون تشییع پیکر آیت‌الله رئیسی هویت و مدنیت ایرانی را به شدت بازتولید می‌کند و نشان می‌دهد که ملت ایران هویتی زنده و به شدت هوشمند دارد و این مبحثی خیلی جدی است. فیاض با اشاره به سال‌های ابتدایی پیروزی انقلاب اسلامی گفت: وقتی بهشتی شهید شد تمام آثار منفی‌ که دشمنان می‌خواستند با کشتن ایشان به وجود بیاورند از بین رفت و تبدیل به ضد خود شد؛ خاطرم است آن موقع ما در حزب جمهوری اسلامی فقط پنج نفر بودیم اما وقتی بهشتی شهید شد، حزب پر از عضو شد. این مرگ‌ها سبب بازتولید ملیت ایرانی شده و در تمام جهان مورد توجه واقع می‌شود. این استاد دانشگاه تهران خاطر نشان کرد: در سال های ابتدایی پیروزی انقلاب اسلامی، اخبار این تشییع‌ها مختصر پخش می‌شد ولی اکنون با حضور شبکه‌های اجتماعی بازتاب آنها در جهان وسیع است. فیاض گفت: تحلیل غربی‌ها این بود که ایرانی‌ها به دلیل مشکلات اقتصادی که با آن مواجه هستند، در آیین تشییع شرکت نمی‌کنند اما شاهد عکس آن بودیم. این مردم شناس خاطر نشان کرد: البته زندگی در ایران به خاطر سیاست‌های سرمایه‌داری که سال‌ها حکومت‌های غربگرا در کشور اجرا کردند، دشوار شده است و مردم هم از این بابت ناراحت هستند. فیاض با بیان این‌که از بعد جنگ، غربگراها بر کشور حکومت کردند، افزود: در ابتدای جنگ غربگرایی مثل بنی صدر حاضر نبود اجازه دهد مردم وارد میدان شوند. او به شدت با بسیج می‌جنگید اما از لحظه‌ای که بنی صدر رفت و شَر غربگرایی از سر جنگ برداشته شد، شاهد بودیم که عملیات‌های فتح‌المبین و بیت‌المقدس صورت گرفت و پیروزی به دست آمد. هر جا مردمی بودیم، بُرد کردیم. این استاد دانشگاه تهران آیت الله شهید رئیسی را فردی مردمی توصیف کرد و گفت: ما تا پایان جنگ مردمی بودیم اما پس از آن بازتوزیع غربگرایانه در کشور شروع شد و مردم سراغ سرمایه‌داری رفتند و رانت خواری‌هایی هم صورت گرفت؛ اما آقای رئیسی این قصه را برهم زد و مسیر را به اصل انقلاب برگرداند. دیدیم که مردم هم در تشییع جنازه ایشان چه کردند. فیاض با بیان اینکه شهید رئیسی تبدیل به یک اسطوره شده است، افزود: این استاد دانشگاه گفت: برای زنده ماندن یک فرهنگ، تراژدی خیلی مهم است؛ البته نه به معنای غربی آن، بلکه به معنای سوگنامه بودنش. ایران فرهنگ خود را با همین سوگنامه‌ها نگه داشته است، قبل از اسلام سیاوشان و بعد از آن شهادت امام حسین(ع). فرهنگ برای بازسازی خود به همین سوگنامه‌ها برمی‌گردد. فیاض افزود: یک جامعه زنده اخبار مرگ بزرگان خود را نگه می‌دارد، به آن آب و تاب می‌دهد و بر پایه آن مناسک می‌سازد. جامعه زنده از مرگ، حیات درست می‌کند. جامعه ایران نیز از مرگ رئیس جمهور خود زندگی می‌سازد. ، آیت الله خادم‌الرضا(ع) و هشتمین رئیس جمهور اسلامی ایران عصر یکشنبه ۳۰ اردیبهشت ۱۴۰۳ در مسیر بازگشت از مراسم افتتاح سد «قیز قلعه‌سی» به سمت تبریز، در منطقه ورزقان استان آذربایجان شرقی دچار سانحه هوایی شد و با همراهان خود همزمان با شب ولادت امام رئوف علی ابن موسی الرضا(ع) به مقام رفیع شهادت نائل آمد؛ حضرت آیت الله خامنه ای رهبر معظم انقلاب اسلامی با اشاره به حرکت و قیام مردم در تشییع این شهدا در تبریز، قم، تهران، شهرری، بیرجند، مشهد، مراغه، زنجان و نجف‌آباد گفتند: این تشییع باشکوه نشان داد که ملت ایران زنده است.",

        "content": "REPUBLIKA.CO.ID, BENGKALIS -- Bea Cukai Bengkalis gagalkan upaya penyelundupan 28 ton mangga dan bawang merah ilegal di perairan Sungai Kembung, Kecamatan Bantan, Kabupaten Bengkalis, pada Jumat (24/05). Diketahui barang selundupan tersebut bernilai Rp 1.050.274.412. Kepala Seksi Kepatuhan Internal dan Penyuluhan Bea Cukai Bengkalis, Ariyadi Permana Hamdani mengatakan penindakan itu berawal dari informasi yang kami terima dari masyarakat tentang adanya pemasukan barang ilegal berupa bawang merah asal Batu Pahat, Malaysia, dengan menggunakan KM. Rafida Jaya. Atas informasi tersebut, satuan tugas (satgas) patroli laut Bea Cukai segera berkoordinasi dan melancarkan patroli, hingga akhirnya dapat mendeteksi kapal mencurigakan dengan muatan ditutupi terpal masuk ke perairan Sungai Kembung. \"Satgas patroli laut Bea Cukai segera memerintahkan anak buah kapal (ABK) kapal tersebut untuk berhenti guna dilakukan pemeriksaan. Namun kapal tersebut tidak mengindahkan perintah dan berusaha menghindar dengan mengarahkan kapal ke dalam Sungai Kembung. Kapal itu kemudian menabrak pohon bakau di tepi Sungai Kembung dan ABK kapal tersebut melarikan diri dengan cara melompat ke laut dan lari ke dalam hutan bakau,\" ungkapnya. Dari hasil pemeriksaan, petugas menemukan 16.368 kilogram mangga dan 12.555 kilogram bawang merah yang tidak memiliki dokumen kepabeanan dan dokumen perizinan impor lainnya dalam hal ini dokumen yang dipersyaratkan oleh Badan Karantina Indonesia. \"Kami langsung mengamankan KM. Rafida Jaya beserta muatannya dan membawa kapal tersebut dengan pengawalan oleh satgas patroli laut menuju Kantor Bantu Bea Cukai Sungai Pakning untuk penelitian lebih lanjut,\" lanjut Ariyadi. Pemasukan barang ilegal tersebut diduga melanggar Pasal 102 huruf a Undang-undang Nomor 17 Tahun 2006 tentang Perubahan atas Undang-undang Nomor 10 Tahun 1995 tentang Kepabeanan yang berbunyi “Setiap orang yang mengangkut barang impor yang tidak tercantum dalam manifes dipidana karena melakukan penyelundupan di bidang impor dengan pidana penjara paling singkat satu tahun dan pidana penjara paling lama sepuluh tahun dan pidana denda paling sedikit Rp 50.000.000,00 dan paling banyak Rp 5.000.000.000,00.\" Atas penindakan itu, Bea Cukai Bengkalis telah mencegah potensi kerugian negara sebesar Rp 304.579.580,00 dan mencegah beredarnya barang ilegal yang tidak terjamin keamanan, manfaat, dan mutunya. \"Operasi penindakan tersebut merupakan wujud nyata peran Bea Cukai untuk melindungi masyarakat dari potensi berbahaya barang-barang yang tidak memenuhi ketentuan perundang-undangan yang berlaku. Melalui kegiatan ini, kami juga berharap dapat mendukung daya saing komoditas dalam negeri yang sudah memenuhi ketentuan agar tidak tergerus oleh komoditas sejenis dari luar negeri, serta tentunya memberi efek jera kepada para pelaku pelanggaran kepabeanan dan cukai,\" ujar Ariyadi. Ia menegaskan bahwa pihaknya berkomitmen untuk melakukan upaya yang optimal dalam pengawasan terhadap lalu lintas barang impor dan ekspor, dan bekerja sama dengan aparat penegak hukum serta stakeholder terkait untuk menjamin terpenuhinya ketentuan perundang-undangan yang berlaku. \"Dukungan masyarakat sangat dibutuhkan dalam upaya menjaga wilayah Indonesia dari masuknya barang-barang ilegal. Terima kasih atas peran aktif masyarakat yang telah mendukung pelaksanaan tugas Bea Cukai, khususnya di wilayah pengawasan Bea Cukai Bengkalis,\" tutur Ariyadi.",

The major Italian daily newspapers and both cited anonymous sources as saying that the pope had made the remark while reiterating his position against gay people becoming priests.

The incident was first reported by political gossip site Dagospia, which said it happened on May 20 during the opening of the four-day Italian Bishops Conference. cited unnamed bishops who confirmed the reports to them, but added that the pope, who is originally from Argentina, may not have been aware of the offensive nature of the term. Despite his opposition to gay people becoming priests, Pope Francis has generally , drawing anger from more conservative members of the .

Under Francis's predecessor Pope Benedict XVI, the Vatican said that the Church could accept as priests people who had overcome homosexual tendencies for three years.

Trindall pleaded guilty on Tuesday in Sutherland Court to mid-range drink driving and driving with an illicit substance in his system. He received a $1,100 fine and a three-month suspension from driving. Hynes' secondment to NSW State of Origin camp opened up a spot in the halves for Trindall this week after the playmaker impressed on his return to training from a leave of absence. Trindall will partner five-eighth Daniel Atkinson in the halves for the round-13 clash against Parramatta, who welcome their two most important players Mitch Moses and Clint Gutherson back from injury this Thursday. The game will be Trindall's first since starring in Cronulla's 42-6 rout of North Queensland in round seven. Brandon Trindall has learnt his fate in court after a drink driving charge The Sharks star copped a $1100 fine and has been banned from driving for three months '(Trindall) knows he let us down a little bit and he'll be looking to show us that he means something to us and the club means something to him,' said Sharks halfback Hynes. 'He's been looking good at training, he's working hard. I think he's trying to put a bit more muscle on, he's working hard in the gym, he's looking great, his energy's back so it would be a massive, massive boost if he could play for us on Thursday night.' Moses has not appeared for the Eels since fracturing his foot in the round-three loss to Manly in March. The Eels have won only one of eight games since their influential halfback went down and sacked coach Brad Arthur in that span. Gutherson's return from a four-week knee injury lay-off has pushed boom rookie Blaize Talagi from fullback and onto the bench for the Eels' second game under interim coach Trent Barrett. The Sharks also have Toby Rudolf back on deck following his knee injury. Sydney Roosters veteran Michael Jennings has recovered from a triceps injury and will start from the bench against North Queensland for his fifth appearance in a controversial comeback season. Tom Chester returns from a hamstring injury to strengthen the Origin-hit Cowboys, with Braidon Burns, Harrison Edwards, Jake Clifford, Jamal Shibasaki and Jake Granville all added to the 17. His Sharks teammate, Nicho Hynes, has backed him to bounce back from the ordeal Preston Riki and Trent Toelau will make their NRL debuts for Penrith, who have lost five players to State of Origin duty ahead of the clash against St George Illawarra. Toby and Ryan Couchman and Mat and Max Feagai join the Dragons' 17 to cover for the joint venture's own Origin absentees and last week's injuries to Hame Sele and Jack Bird. Jesse Marschke replaces Ben Hunt in the halves. Late bloomer Trai Fuller will play fullback for the Dolphins, who have lost Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow to Origin duty ahead of the clash with Canberra.

        "content": "Экс-мэр Лянтора(ХМАО) Сергей Махиня отстоял в суде «золотой парашют» в виде премии в 860 тысяч рублей, которые он получил при выходе на пенсию. Об этом URA.RU сообщил источник в политическом истеблишменте города. «Суд отказал прокуратуре, которая требовала вернуть выданные экс-чиновнику премию — почти миллион рублей. Депутаты одобри ее уже после скандальной отставки. За месяц до этого Махиня избежал увольнения по утрате доверия — силовики вскрыли конфликт интересов с его дочерью, которая руководила КСК „Юбилейный“, но экс-мэр успел уйти на пенсию по собственному желанию», — сообщил собеседник. Депутаты согласовали Махине начисления по новым правилам, которые были приняты после отставки. Прокуратура усмотрела в этом нарушения и обратилась в суд. «27 мая было вынесено решение об отказе иска прокуратуры», — добавил собеседник. Для уточнения информации журналист агентства обратился в суд. Там не ответили на звонок. Между тем на сайте суда размещена информация, что в иске прокуратуры отказано. В надзорном ведомстве сообщили, что подготовят информацию по разбирательству и направят в адрес редакции позже. Махиня не ответил на звонок журналиста. Ранее URA.RU сообщало, что прокуратура заставила экс-мэра из ХМАО вернуть «золотой парашют» почти в млн рублей. В надзорном ведомстве уверены в незаконном обогащении за счет бюджета.

        "description": "Zufriedenheit, Wohlstand, Zusammenhalt: Was macht Glück aus? Der neue Glücksatlas offenbart, was die Städte an der Spitze auszeichnet.",
        "content": "Kassel triumphiert im nationalen Glücksranking und steigt zur zufriedensten Großstadt Deutschlands auf. Der neue Glücksatlas offenbart, was die Städte an der Spitze auszeichnet. Die Menschen in Kassel halten sich für die glücklichsten Großstädter. Wie aus dem sogenannten SKL-Glücksatlas hervorgeht, welcher der Nachrichtenagentur AFP am Dienstag vorlag, führt die nordhessische Stadt bei der Lebenszufriedenheit die Rangliste der 40 größten deutschen Städte an. Auf einer Skala von null bis zehn kommt Kassel auf 7,38 Punkte. Es folgen Erfurt, Aachen, Kiel, Krefeld und Münster. Für das Städteranking befragte das Institut für Demoskopie Allensbach im Auftrag der Süddeutschen Klassenlotterie (SKL) erstmals Einwohnerinnen und Einwohner von 40 Großstädten mit mehr als 200.000 Einwohnern. Insgesamt nahmen zwischen Januar 2021 und April 2024 rund 25.500 Menschen teil. Was macht Glück aus? Das persönliche Lebensglück ist demnach in kleineren, beschaulichen Städten am größten. Diese Städte vereinen der Studie zufolge eine eher familiäre Atmosphäre, Ruhe, ein oft studentisches Umfeld, viele Grünflächen und eine gute Luftqualität. Bei den objektiven Indikatoren für Lebensqualität wie zum Beispiel Einkommen, Infrastruktur und Wirtschaftskraft liegen diese Städte nur leicht über dem Durchschnitt – die Spitzenreiter sind also nicht besonders wohlhabend. So gibt mit 55,3 Prozent mehr als die Hälfte der Menschen in Kassel an, mit dem Leben hochzufrieden zu sein. Im Schnitt der 40 Großstädte sind es nur 41,8 Prozent. Großstädte wie etwa Stuttgart auf Rang 14 oder München auf Rang 24 haben zwar eine sehr hohe Lebensqualität mit hohen Einkommen und geringer Arbeitslosigkeit, die Menschen dort sind der Umfrage zufolge aber nur mittelmäßig glücklich. Das liegt der Studie zufolge daran, dass viele Großstädte mit Problemvierteln, hoher Kriminalität, sozialer Isolation, überlasteter Infrastruktur oder auch schwierigen Wohnungsmärkten zu kämpfen haben. Deshalb gebe es dort überdurchschnittlich viele Unzufriedene. Macht Geld glücklich? Die ersten Städte mit einem hohen Durchschnittseinkommen tauchen im Ranking erst auf Rang sieben mit Augsburg und Rang acht mit Düsseldorf auf. Düsseldorf ist damit die glücklichste Stadt mit mehr als 500.000 Einwohnern. Leipzig sticht als größte ostdeutsche Stadt auf Rang elf heraus. Punkten können Städte bei der Lebenszufriedenheit demnach vor allem mit einer guten Familien- und Bildungspolitik – etwa der Zahl von Grundschulen und Kitaplätzen. Ein höheres Bruttoinlandsprodukt, mehr Kultur und Freizeit oder eine bessere Verkehrsinfrastruktur fallen hingegen schwächer ins Gewicht. Veränderung zum Vorjahr Beim Ranking aus dem vergangenen Jahr lag übrigens Hamburg vorne, gefolgt von Frankfurt am Main und München. Für diesen Glücksatlas hatte die SKL jedoch Befragungen in 12 Großstädten durchgeführt, und nicht wie jetzt aus 40 Großstädten. Damals zeigte sich, dass eine Stadt, die eine hohe Wertschöpfung und Kaufkraft hat, zum Glück der Bewohner beiträgt. Auch das Zusammengehörigkeitsgefühl der Bewohner ist ausschlaggebend dafür, wie zufrieden diese sind.",

        "content": "A pair of Aussie Olympians are in the middle of an ugly spat over selection for the 2024 Paris Games, after a controversial decision on the women’s marathon team. Six women met the Olympic entry standard of 2:26:50 Sinead Diver, Genevieve Gregson and Jess Stenson (nee Trengove) have been selected, with only three spots available. That has seen Lisa Weightman, a four-time Olympian and two-time Commonwealth Games medallist, fighting to be selected in a furore that has spilled onto social media. Weightman ran the third-fastest time in the qualification period, a 2:23:15 behind Gregson’s 2:23:08 and Diver’s 2:21:34, but ahead of Izzi Batt-Doyle (2:23:27), Eloise Wellings (2:25:47) and critically Stenson (2:24:01). But Stenson, who won gold at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, ran her time just six months after giving birth to her second child. Things got personal on Tuesday when Weightman’s husband Lachlan McArthur angrily tweeted at Stenson, asking her to remove the header image on her Twitter account which saw both families happy after a race. “@JessTrengove could you please take down your background photo of my family,” McArthur wrote . “BTW, this was after one of the 7-1 all-time head to head wins by @LisaWeightman.” The post showed that McArthur had already ‘muted’ Stenson’s account, to avoid her posts, and was not following her. Stenson changed the photo with McArthur then replying: “Thank you @JessTrengove for taking down the photo. It is much appreciated. We have a heartbroken family here”. McArthur has since deleted his account. Weightman reportedly can lodge one more appeal to be selected for the Games.",

        "content": "Astronomers have spotted an unusually dense planet designated as TOI-1824 b. The planet contains much more mass than other worlds of similar size, and challenges conventional theories of planet assembly. Scientists suspect that the planet is a particularly massive water world. New Delhi: An international team of planet hunters have released the largest single catalogue so far characterising exoplanets after three years of research. 126 exoplanets are part of the new catalogue, out of which 120 planets are confirmed, while six are exoplanet candidates. Several exoplanets in the catalogue are weird and wonderful worlds, with one planet standing out in particular, designated as TOI-1824 b. TOI-1824 b is a Sub-Neptune exoplanet, straddling the size gap between Earth and Neptune. A paper describing the findings has been published in The Astronomical Journal . Coauthor of the paper, Joseph Murphy says , “At nearly 19 times the mass of Earth, but only 2.6 times the size of our home planet, TOI-1824 b is an exoplanet oddity. Planets similar in size typically have a mass between roughly 6 and 12 times the mass of Earth. This superdense sub-Neptune may be the massive cousin of water worlds, which are small planets with high H 2 O content purported to exist around red dwarf stars.” Red Dwarf stars and planetary habitability Red Dwarf stars, also known as M Dwarfs are the most common type of star in the Milky Way. The transit method for discovering exoplanets favours the detection of large worlds in close orbits around host stars. The method observes patches of the sky for telltale dips in the light of stars as a planet passes in front of them from the vantage point of the Earth, in events known as transits. These stars are cooler than the Sun, and planets closer to them can contain liquid water on the surface, making these systems easier to study. Why is TOI-1824 b so dense? Scientists do not yet know exactly why TOI-1824 b is so dense, but they have some theories. One explanation is that TOI-1824 b is actually massive, with an Earth-like core surrounded by an unusually thin, hydrogen-rich atmosphere. Another possibility is that the world has a water rich core surrounded by an atmosphere of steam.",

        "description": "История участника СВО, который второй раз стал героем для всей России",
        "content": "В 2016 году в селе Миасское Челябинской области Александр Григорьев из охотничьего ружья расстрелял пять уголовников, напавших на его дом и родных. Дело получило всероссийский резонанс, и мужчину оправдали — это стало уникальный случаем в судебной практике. В 2022 году Григорьев ушел добровольцем на СВО и получил множество наград — последнюю за несколько дней до гибели. Сотни людей на похоронах назвали его героем. URA.RU собрал все, что известно о челябинце, ставшем примером смелости и мужества. Краткая история конфликта В ночь с 1 на 2 января 2016 года в частном доме села Миасское были застрелены из охотничьего ружья трое мужчин и одна женщина из соседнего села Курейное возрастом от 26 до 32 лет. Еще один мужчина госпитализирован с огнестрельным дробовым ранением левого предплечья. Как выяснилось чуть позже, трое из непрошенных гостей имели судимости за кражи, а женщина отбывала наказание за убийство. Нападавшие находились в состоянии алкогольного и наркотического опьянения. Александра Григорьева задержали и взяли под арест на два месяца, в полиции началось расследование. Было возбуждено уголовное дело по признакам состава преступления, предусмотренного п. «а» ч. 2 ст. 105 УК РФ (убийство двух и более лиц). Выяснилось, что новогодние праздники Григорьев отмечал вместе с супругой, детьми, родным братом и его бывшей женой. Именно ее искали нападавшие, приехавшие из соседнего села. Он защищал семью и дом Как оказалось, родственнице Григорьева позвонил один из мужчин из соседнего села и услышал мужские голоса. Он собрал компанию и, вооружившись ножами и палками, приехал на такси к дому Григорьева. Хозяина дома сильно избили, затащили в дом и бросили, а затем переключились на его брата. В это время Григорьев сумел добраться до сейфа, достать охотничье ружье (разрешение на оружие имелось) и зарядить пятью патронами. В этот момент на него напал один из мужчин с ножом, Григорьев выстрелил в него, а затем вышел во двор и произвел несколько выстрелов в уголовников, которые избивали его брата. Четверо погибли на месте, один оказался серьезно ранен. Хозяин дома сам вызвал полицию и скорую помощь. Сам Григорьев получил множество травм: врачи диагностировали закрытую черепно-мозговую травму, множественные ушибы головы, переломы ребер. За медицинской помощью с различными повреждениями также обращались родной брат Григорьева и его супруга. Расследование После ареста мужчины следователи допросили более 30 свидетелей, назначено более 20 экспертиз, в том числе судебно-медицинские, баллистические, молекулярно-генетические. Сам Григорьев сразу заявлял, что только «защищал свой дом и семью». История получила огромный общественный резонанс, о ней рассказали в эфире одного из федеральных телеканалов. В интернете были собраны десятки тысяч подписей под петицией, где люди требовали освободить челябинца, признав его действия самообороной. Дело было взято на контроль главы СКР Александра Бастрыкина. Через неделю Григорьева отпустили из СИЗО под домашний арест, а затем госпитализировали в больницу для лечения полученных травм. Он прошел психиатрическую экспертизу , которая подтвердила, что мужчина не был в состоянии аффекта В сентябре 2016 года уголовное дело в отношении Григорьева было закрыто в связи с отсутствием состава преступления. Спустя месяц прокуратура Челябинской области отменила решение СКР о прекращении уголовного преследования для того, чтобы устранить процессуальные нарушения. В январе 2017 года дело было повторно закрыто, не дойдя до суда. Григорьев был полностью оправдан. Мастер на все руки Александр Григорьев был знаком всем жителям села. Он сам построил дом, в котором жил всей семьей. После школы служил моряком на подводной лодке в Севастополе. Затем стал профессиональным сварщиком и прошел множество курсов, чтобы стать мастером на все руки. Всегда с энтузиазмом осваивал новые направления, чтобы стать высококлассным и востребованным специалистом. Доблестно защищал Родину В 2022 году в рамках частичной мобилизации Григорьев отправился на передовую , где после короткой учебы стал оператором беспилотников. За два года он был удостоен множества наград: Ордена Мужества и Георгиевского креста, а также медалей Суворова, Жукова и «За Отвагу». Мужчина погиб через четыре дня после вручения последней медали, которое произошло 9 мая. «Он вместе с водителем и оператором ехал на „Уазике“ на подъезде к передовой. И тут вражеский дрон... Прямое попадание в машину», — сообщил Алексей Пешков, который был адвокатом челябинца на громком процессе и продолжал поддерживать с ним связь и после оправдания.

        "content": "Clinical trials on pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis have shown success using a flexible device that can stimulate sweat glands and simultaneously monitor biosignals. This groundbreaking research was a two-year collaboration between KIST and Northwestern University. Dr. Kim Joohee, a renowned figure from the Bionics Research Center at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), and Professor John A. Rogers, a distinguished name from Northwestern University , have jointly unveiled a groundbreaking development in non-invasive health monitoring. Their collaborative effort has led to the creation of a revolutionary sweat monitoring device, a game-changer in the field of health technology, that eliminates the need for intense physical activity to induce sweat. The newly developed device, a testament to innovation, is designed to collect and analyze biomarkers in sweat. This enables the painless and convenient monitoring of various health conditions, from diabetes to genetic disorders. Unlike previous methods that relied on physical activity to induce sweat, this device delivers drugs that stimulate sweat glands through the skin, making the process effortless and accessible to individuals with limited mobility. The small, soft, and flexible device can be easily attached to the skin. Applying a current to a hydrogel containing drugs stimulates sweat glands, and the sweat is collected in microfluidic channels within the device for analysis using biosensors. This method reduces the need for cumbersome hospital visits for testing and lowers the risk of biomarker contamination during testing, thereby increasing accuracy. The device was tested in a clinical research study. It was successfully attached to infants with cystic fibrosis, and chloride concentration, a key biomarker in sweat, was accurately measured. The results were consistent with traditional hospital analysis methods, with an accuracy rate exceeding 98%. This breakthrough can revolutionize disease monitoring, particularly for pediatric patients, by enabling easy and continuous monitoring of disease progression and physical conditions at home. Dr. Kim Joohee expressed her enthusiasm for the collaborative research’s success, stating, “Through two years of collaborative research with Northwestern University, we have not only addressed the limitations of existing methods for inducing sweat but also achieved success in clinical research, bringing us one step closer to commercialization.” Professor John A. Rogers added, “We plan to conduct large-scale clinical studies and commercialization, including adults, in the future.” The implications of this new technology extend beyond health monitoring . The method of delivering drugs through the skin can also be utilized to increase the delivery rate of drugs in localized areas, such as skin conditions or wounds, thereby accelerating recovery. Also Read: Electronic skin for monitoring stress responses This groundbreaking development marks a significant advancement in non-invasive disease monitoring technology, with far-reaching implications for pediatric and adult patients. The potential for commercialization and widespread application of this innovative sweat monitoring device represents a significant step forward in non-invasive health technology. Journal Reference",

        "content": "The iPad was initially designed to be used primarily in portrait orientation, with the Apple logo placed vertically on the back. However, as Apple continues to market the iPad as a potential laptop replacement, more users are interacting with it in landscape orientation, especially when using accessories like the Magic Keyboard. This shift in usage has led to questions about whether Apple will ever change the orientation of the logo on the back of the iPad. In a recent interview with Numerama, reported by MacRumors, Apple industrial designer Molly Anderson addressed this question. She acknowledged that the current vertical logo might not be permanent. Anderson stated, “This could change” in the future, suggesting that Apple is aware of the increasing preference for landscape mode and may adjust the logo orientation accordingly. Anderson explained that users can hold the versatile iPad in any direction. However, she also recognized that landscape mode has become more popular in recent years, particularly with the use of keyboard accessories and the iPad’s growing role as a laptop alternative. This shift has made the vertically oriented Apple logo seem out of place when the device is in a landscape position. Apple has already made some adjustments that reflect the growing preference for landscape orientation. For instance, the 10th generation iPad, released in 2022, features a front camera positioned at the centre of the screen when the device is in a landscape position. This design choice has been carried over to newer models like the M2 iPad Air and the M4 iPad Pro. Additionally, since iPadOS 14.5, the Apple logo aligns with the device’s orientation during the boot process, whether it is in portrait or landscape positions. While changing the orientation of the Apple logo on the back of the iPad may seem like a minor, cosmetic update, it would signify a significant shift in how to perceive and use the iPad. Such a change would align the iPad more closely with MacBooks, which have the logo oriented for optimal visibility in landscape mode. It would also reflect Apple’s recognition of the iPad’s evolving role from a supplementary device to a primary computing tool for many users. This potential redesign raises an interesting discussion among Apple enthusiasts and iPad users. The adjustment would be more than just a cosmetic tweak; it would symbolize Apple’s commitment to evolving its products based on user behaviour and feedback. Aligning the logo with the most common usage orientation reinforces the iPad’s versatility and modern functionality. Would you like to see the logo in landscape orientation on the back of iPads? Such a change could enhance the aesthetic coherence of Apple’s product lineup and better reflect how users interact with their devices today. Share your thoughts in the comments section below. This feedback could potentially influence future design decisions and help shape the evolution of Apple’s iconic tablet.

        "content": "به گزارش ، حجت‌الاسلام «محمد محمدی گلپایگانی» رییس دفتر رهبر معظم انقلاب اسلامی، امروز در مراسم بزرگداشت رییس‌جمهور شهید و شهدای نیروی هوایی ارتش در دانشگاه شهید ستاری، اظهار کرد: در زمان انقلاب اسلامی، پرسنل نیروی هوایی با لباس رسمی در مدرسه رفاه حضور پیدا کردند و با امام امت بیعت کردند؛ این نقش نیروی هوایی بود که آن روز در زمان انقلاب اسلامی، کار را تمام کرد. وی با اشاره به به شهادت رییس‌جمهور و همراهان ایشان افزود: مصیبت شهادت رییس‌جمهور و همراهان ایشان، همه ما را داغدار کرده است اما شایسته و لازم است در رابطه با استقبال عظیم و میلیونی مردم ایران از شهدای خدمت، بررسی‌های لازم درباره دلایل این حضور و استقبال صورت بگیرد. محمدی گلپایگانی تاکید کرد: در شهرستان قم در حالی‌ که فاصله بین مسجد جمکران و شهر قم ۸ کیلومتر است، تمام این مسیر مملو از جمعیت بود؛ این در حالی است که قم جمعیتی ندارد اما بیش از ۱ میلیون نفر از مردم قم در این تشییع جنازه شرکت کرده بودند؛ در مشهد و در تهران هم وضعیت اینگونه بود. رییس دفتر رهبر معظم انقلاب اسلامی گفت: مراکز علمی و دانشگاهی باید راز و رمز حضور مردم در تشییع شهدای خدمت را بررسی کنند چراکه این تشییع در دنیا بی‌سابقه است. وی افزود: در حالی که در برخی کشورهای جهان اگر رهبری از دنیا برود، مردم‌شان جشن می‌گیرند اما شاهدیم در ایران بعد از رحلت حضرت امام(ره) و بعد از شهادت حاج‌قاسم سلیمانی، مردم ما تشییع با شکوه برگزار کردند. محمدی گلپایگانی با اشاره به انعکاس تشییع شهدای خدمت در سطح جهان، اظهار کرد: انعکاس حضور مردم در دنیا آنقدر عجیب بود که در شورای امنیت سازمان ملل که بعضی اعضای آن به سرکردگی آمریکا دشمنان قسم‌خورده ما هستند، به احترام شهادت رییس‌جمهور فقید یک دقیقه سکوت کردند. در حال تکمیل...",

        "content": "TOKYO (AP) — As economies in Asia and the Pacific slow and grow older, countries need to do more to ensure that workers get the education, training and social safety nets needed to raise incomes and ensure social equity, a United Nations report said Tuesday. The report by the International Labor Organization said that growth in productivity has slowed, hurting incomes and undermining the purchasing power of the region's 2 billion workers. By improving productivity, governments can boost incomes and better prepare for the aging of their work forces, the report said. Two in three workers in the region were in informal employment in 2023, such as day labor, lacking the kinds of protections that come from formal jobs. “The lack of job opportunities that meet decent work criteria, including good incomes, not only jeopardizes social justice in the region, but it also presents a risk factor for the labor market outlook,” the report said. Showing the potential for improvement, labor productivity grew at an average annual rate of 4.3% in 2004-2021, helping to raise incomes per worker in terms of purchasing power parity, which compares standards of living in different countries using a common currency, to $15,700 from $7,700. But it has slowed in the past decade, the report said, hindering progress toward greater affluence. It highlighted various challenges, especially unemployment among young people not in school, which is more than triple the adult rate, at 13.7%. Increasing use of artificial intelligence and other automation technology will cause some people to lose their jobs, it said, with women engaged in clerical and information technology work most likely to be affected as companies roll back their reliance on offshore call centers that have provided good quality jobs in countries like the Philippines and India. Other factors such as trade disputes and political turmoil threaten to disrupt jobs in some industries, but aging poses an even bigger challenge as countries grow old before they become affluent. The ratio of people in Asia aged older than 65 to those 15–64 years old is projected to double to nearly a third by 2050 from about 15% in 2023, the ILO report says. In places like Japan, short-handed employers have moved to alleviate work loads by using robots and computerized ordering in restaurants, cutting hours and installing self-checkout machines. The report noted that a key reason why some countries face labor shortages despite having ample numbers of unemployed or underemployed workers is a mismatch between jobs and skills and education. “The region still has huge potential for upskilling, productivity improvements and efficiency gains, which can alleviate demographic pressures on the labor market,\" it said. The report noted that more than a third of workers in the region have educational levels too low for their occupations, compared with 18% of workers in high-income countries. Among other findings: People in Asia and the Pacific still work more hours than workers in other regions, at 44 hours per week on average, though that is down from more than 47 hours in 2005. In 2023, nearly 73 million workers in the region lived in extreme poverty, with daily incomes of less than $2.15 in purchasing power parity per person. Despite raising retirement ages, total labor force participation in the Asia-Pacific region fell from 67% in 1991 to about 61% in 2023. It's projected to fall to 55% by 2050. The need for workers to provide long-term care in the region is forecast to more than double to 90 million by 2050 from 46 million in 2023. That would raise the proportion of people working in the field to 4.3% of the total from 2.3% now. Elaine Kurtenbach, The Associated Press",

        "content": "Team India squad for the T20 World Cup will soon assemble in New York as the second batch of players left on Monday (May 27) night. Captain was part of the first batch that travelled on May 25 (Saturday) and is already in New York gearing up for the mega event. He is set to feature in his ninth T20 World Cup and possibly his last in the format. Meanwhile, having played each and every World Cup in the format so far, Rohit Sharma is on the verge of breaking quite a few records in the tournament. He has already played most matches in the competition but is at the fourth position in the list of highest run-scorers. However, the 37-year-old is certain to go past and Mahela Jaywardene in this list this time around. Rohit has so far amassed 963 runs in 36 innings at the T20 World Cup at an average of 34.39 with nine fifties to his name and at a strike rate of 127.88. He needs only threeruns to surpass Univers Boss Gayle who has 965 runs to his name and is not playing international cricket anymore. Rohit is also only 54 runs away from going past Mahela Jayawardene who amassed 1016 in the mega event during his playing career. Virat Kohli is on top of the list with 1141 runs in just 25 innings at an unreal average of 81.5 and is featuring in the upcoming edition as well. Coming back to Rohit Sharma, he can also surpass Gayle in the list of players with most sixes in T20 World Cup. However, for that to happen, the India skipper will need to have a blockbuster World Cup as he is 29 sixes away from Gayle in this aspect.",

        "description": "A high-ranking British delegation has called off its visit to New Delhi just before the UK general elections, casting doubt on the discussions for a proposed India-UK free trade agreement (FTA). The delegation was set to arrive on Tuesday, 28 May, to finalise terms on several contentious issues, including work visas for Indians, duty relaxations, and imports of British-made electric vehicles",
        "content": "A high-ranking British delegation has abruptly cancelled its scheduled visit to New Delhi, throwing the ongoing talks on a planned free trade agreement (FTA) into uncertainty. The delegation, set to arrive on 28 May, was supposed to finalise terms on contentious issues such as work visas for Indians, duty relaxations, and imports of British-made electric vehicles. The cancellation, reported by HT’s Mint newspaper , has raised concerns on both sides, particularly given the significant advances reported in recent talks. “The British officials have cancelled their visit without providing a specific reason. It is assumed that the announcement of elections may have led to the cancellation of their trip,” a person familiar with the situation told the newspaper. “The deal was progressing very positively. We were hopeful of closing some of the remaining chapters, which are challenging for both sides,” this person added. In the past, the UK side has mostly refused to comment on the deal or give updates to the media. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has called elections for 4 July this year, bringing into question why the UK does not want to continue talks just as India did during their own election period. How have the negotiations gone so far? The seeds of this FTA were sown in May 2021 when then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed on deeper trade cooperation. This “Enhanced Trade Partnership” removed several trade barriers and set the stage for the FTA negotiations that began in January 2022. Johnson had initially declared that the agreement should be completed, in time for an announcement on Diwali 2022 . However, by October 2022, UK Secretary of State for International Trade Kemi Badenoch shifted the focus to the quality rather than the speed of the deal. As of December 2023, the UK and India had completed the 13th round of negotiations, fast-tracking the process to finalise the agreement before the elections in both countries. Also Read : Why UK is desperate for a trade deal with India? Negotiations have been mired in several issues, with the UK’s concerns about visas for professionals being a major sticking point. The 14th round of negotiations began in January 2024, with India pushing for the inclusion of social security payments for Indian workers in the UK, which was reported as a point of contention for Badenoch. In March 2024, UK negotiators made a “last-gasp attempt to clinch an FTA before the Indian election campaign pauses talks,” according to a UK government official. Despite these efforts, the 14th round of negotiations remained open without a breakthrough on major issues. Badenoch emphasised not using the Indian elections as a deadline, just as India was signing a free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association. What are points of contention in the FTA? The FTA with the UK signifies a strategic shift for India, moving its focus from east to west in terms of preferential trade partnerships. Negotiations are also influenced by specific demands and concessions from both sides. The UK’s demands include tariff cuts for Scotch whisky, which currently attracts a hefty 150 per cent duty, electric vehicles, and chocolates. In contrast, India seeks provisions for Indian professionals to live and work in the UK for a fixed period under work visas, with renewal options. One of the unresolved issues in the negotiations is India’s request for an exemption from the UK’s proposed carbon tax, which is set to be introduced by 2027. This tax aims to incentivise businesses to reduce their carbon emissions but could negatively impact the competitiveness of certain Indian exports to the UK. The UK has not yet agreed to exempt India from this tax, emphasising its commitment to its decarbonisation goals. Trade between India and the UK has seen significant growth, increasing from $10.45 billion in FY22 to $11.46 billion in FY23, and further rising by 13.26 per cent to $12.98 billion in FY24. The FTA is expected to further boost trade volumes, particularly in services, by facilitating the movement of skilled professionals. This could lead to enhanced investment opportunities for UK businesses in India and improved access to India’s expanding consumer market.

Despite the potential benefits, the impact on goods exports may be limited since many Indian products already enter the UK with low or no tariffs. However, reducing duties could benefit Indian exports of textiles, apparel, footwear, carpets, cars, marine products, grapes, and mangoes. This could also lead to increased exports of marine products from the UK to India, benefiting the UK’s marine products industry. What now for the India-UK FTA? Indian negotiators, led by chief negotiator L. Satya Srinivas and deputy chief negotiator Darpan Jain, have been diligently working to resolve the remaining issues, including the proposed carbon tax, business mobility, and duty-free access for certain goods. They remain confident that a mutually agreeable solution will be reached soon. The Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry has placed the completion of the India-UK FTA as a priority for the 100-day agenda after a new government takes charge. “The British delegation informed about the cancellation of their scheduled visit in the previous week following the announcement of polls in the UK,” another source had told HT’s Mint . The situation remains fluid, with both countries awaiting the outcomes of their respective elections. As the political landscape evolves, both nations remain committed to achieving a mutually beneficial agreement, albeit on a delayed timeline.
