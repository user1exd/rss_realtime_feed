        "description": "Alleged corruption is how Starlink received its approval to operate in Zimbabwe, according to several reports.The post Starlink muddies itself with unscrupulous Zimbabwe President deal appeared first on Hypertext.",
        "content": "Starlink has been given the go-ahead to operate in Zimbabwe by its president, Emerson Mnangagwa. A report alleges that Mnangagwa side-stepped regulatory approval to launch Starlink in the country. The company that will be Starlink’s “sole and exclusive” partner in Zimbabwe is owned by one of Mnangagwa’s close friends. There are now eight African nations that offer Starlink to customers as Zimbabwe’s President Emerson Mnangagwa fast-tracked a deal that sees the Elon Musk-owned satellite internet provider launch in the country via IMC Communications. IMC Communications is a local Zimbabwean company owned by Wicknell Chivayo. Several publications have reported that the country’s telecom regulator the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (POTRAZ) has licensed Starlink to operate in Zimbabwe, as per Mnangagwa’s announcement. “I’m pleased to announce that I have approved the licensing of Starlink by POTRAZ to provide advanced internet and related digital processing services in Zimbabwe through its sole and exclusive partner, IMC Communications (Pvt) Ltd,” wrote Mnangagwa on X. A report from The Zimbabwean alleges that this claim is untrue, and in fact, POTRAZ is still deliberating on licensing Starlink in the Southern African nation. Not only that, but sources within POTRAZ expressed surprise to the publication that the president made the announcement without receiving the go-ahead from the regulator. “We at POTRAZ are still deliberating on Starlink,” a source told The Zimbabwean, adding that the application for Starlink to enter the country was “highly technical and requires meticulous analysis.” “We need to be confident that Starlink has given us all the key information and data before we can make a decision. That is why it is taking long to make a decision,” another source at POTRAZ said. POTRAZ is now apparently concerned that the approval for Starlink to launch in the country was given via social media, while it should have gone through all the formal processes before licensing and launching. In a South African context, this would have been like if President Cyril Ramaphosa had side-stepped ICASA’s many regulatory policies and approved Starlink to operate locally. Also, if Ramaphosa had made one of his companies Starlink’s “sole and exclusive” partner as it is alleged that Wicknell Chivayo is a close friend of Mnangagwa. According to TechZim , Chivayo’s company, IMC Communication, doesn’t even have a functional website yet was awarded the Starlink partnership without any formal processes. “There is a lot more on this website to suggest that it was hurriedly constructed to be up in time for today’s announcement,” the publication writes. Adding that some links are broken, and others lead to placeholder text. Clicking on ‘broadband’ or ‘satellite tv’ leads you to the generic ‘Hello WPHix’ page. We checked the website out , and it looks like a generic template, purported to be from a firm called “Etudes Architecture” which is a placeholder name. We also can’t find any offers to subscribe to Starlink at all. TechZim says that IMC is offering the Starlink kit for $650 (US), and there are three tiers of subscriptions: $38 a month for 50Mbps, $45 for 100Mbps and $85 for 1000Mbps. A World Bank report from 2021 suggests that only around 35 percent of Zimbabweans have access to the internet, so hopefully the availability of Starlink kits will aid those even in the most rural areas, despite the dodgy situation around its launch.

        "content": "Spain moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland and Norway to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure on Tel Aviv to soften its devastating response to last year's Hamas-led attack. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the Spanish Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state at its Tuesday morning meeting as a European Union rift with Israel widens. Ireland and Norway were also to make official their recognition of a Palestinian state later in the day. \"This is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,\" Sánchez, standing at the gates of the prime minister's palace in Madrid, said during a televised speech. Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz lashed out at Spain on X, saying Sánchez's government was \"being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes.\" While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so. Still, the adherence of three European countries to the group represents a victory for Palestinian efforts in the world of public opinion. Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid insisting that the EU should take action against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza's city of Rafah. Norway, which is not an EU member but often aligns its foreign policy with the bloc, handed diplomatic papers to the Palestinian government over the weekend ahead of its formal recognition of a Palestinian state. At the same time, the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his weight behind the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including leaders of the Hamas militant group. The formal declaration and resulting diplomatic dispute come over seven months into a grinding war waged by Israel against Hamas in Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. Israel's air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Last week's joint announcement by Spain, Ireland and Norway triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries' ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and abductions. Some 140 countries — more than two-thirds of the United Nations — recognize a Palestinian state. The addition of three western European countries to that group will likely put pressure on EU heavyweights France and Germany to think hard about their continued refusal to follow suit. The United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu's government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations. In his speech on Tuesday, Sánchez said that the recognition of a Palestinian state was \"a decision that we do not adopt against anyone, least of all against Israel, a friendly people whom we respect, whom we appreciate and with whom we want to have the best possible relationship.\" The Socialist leader, who announced his country's decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza. He called for a permanent cease-fire, for stepping up humanitarian aid into Gaza and for the release of hostages that Hamas has held since the Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel's response. Sánchez said that the move was to back the beleaguered Palestinian Authority, which lost effective political control of Gaza to Hamas. He laid out his vision for a state ruled by the Palestinian Authority that must connect the West Bank and Gaza via a corridor with east Jerusalem as its capital. The Western-backed Palestinian Authority administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, cooperates with Israel on security matters and favors a negotiated two-state solution. Its forces were driven out of Gaza by Hamas when the militants seized power there in 2007. The Palestinians have long sought an independent state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. The idea of a land corridor linking Gaza and the West Bank through Israel was discussed in previous rounds of peace talks, but no serious or substantive peace negotiations have been held in over 15 years. \"We will not recognize changes in the 1967 border lines other than those agreed to by the parties,\" Sánchez added. \"Furthermore, this decision reflects our absolute rejection of Hamas, a terrorist organization who is against the two-state solution,\" Sánchez said. \"From the outset, Spain has strongly condemned the terrorist attacks of Oct. 7. This clear condemnation is the resounding expression of our steadfast commitment in the fight against terrorism. I would like to underline that starting tomorrow we would focus all our efforts to implement the two state solution and make it a reality.\" Israel is also under pressure from the International Criminal Court after its chief prosecutor said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The ICJ is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied.",

        "content": "The Gautam Adani run empire is looking at applying for a payments licence for UPI transactions that will enable it to compete with the likes of Walmart-backed PhonePe and Alphabet’s Google Pay that together command a lion’s share of India’s digital market. If you think of Adani Group as primarily a B2B conglomerate – think again. Adani’s consumer focus is getting sharper and its touchpoints with us – the consumers –getting wider, and deeper. For one... there is Adani Wilmar – an FMCG player; then there are airports and lounges run by Adani; Adani Power that powers up houses... and there’s the Adani-owned NDTV ... all operating at the cusp of direct to customer. Fresh reports suggest that Adani Group’s latest forays will challenge the big boys of digital payments as well as ecommerce. That’s right. India’s highly competitive digital payments space as well as the ever-growing ecommerce sector is likely to get one more player in Adani Group. The Gautam Adani run empire is looking at applying for a payments licence for UPI transactions that will enable it to compete with the likes of Walmart-backed PhonePe and Alphabet’s Google Pay that together command a lion’s share of India’s digital market. This as per a Financial Times report. Adani Group is yet to confirm the newsbreak. The report also says that Adani Group will enter the ecommerce space by integrating ONDC or the Open Network for Digital Commerce into its Adani One app that it launched in December 2022, a month before the Hindenburg Research allegations surfaced. Adani Group will reportedly also launch a co-branded credit card that will reward users of all Adani services like electricity bills or airport shopping. So let’s take this one by one and see if Adani Group’s digital economy foray makes business sense. The UPI space in India is ballooning. We’re talking hundreds of billions here. India recorded about 131 billion UPI transactions last financial year. 131 billion transactions averages to every Indian popping out that smartphone and transacting over 150 times a year or practically every second day. And the total volume of UPI transactions last year was about ₹200 trillion – or 200 lakh crore rupees! But UPI apps make very little money. Just a 1.1% commission only on transactions over ₹2,000. So in effect, all transactions under ₹2,000 make no money for the UPI service provider. So does it make sense for Adani Group to enter a business that doesn’t make tons of money? It sure doesn’t sound like Gautam Adani. A quick look at which UPI apps India uses. Walmart-backed PhonePe and Alphabet-backed Google Pay together command 86% of India’s UPI space. The rest is split between Paytm, BharatPe, Cred and other such. So, the question is – even if Adani Group eyes the UPI space will it build from scratch of buy out a smaller potential rival? Remember, Paytm which was hit hard by RBI in Jan this year continues to operate as a third-party payment app. Now let’s move to the ecommerce play. Adani Group had launched Adani One in December 2022. It has so far been narrowly focused on travel services like booking flight tickets, train tickets, hotel rooms, and cabs to and from the airport. The Financial Times report says Adani Group will now integrate ONDC on Adani One and play the full ecommerce game. Remember Tata Group tried a super app Tata Neu and could not compete in the ecommerce market. Reliance Ajio on the other hand quickly gained ground. The question for Adani however is – with a crowded space dominated by global players like Amazon as well as Walmart-owned Flipkart, plus domestic players like Reliance Ajio – all in the backdrop of many not so successful upstarts including Snapdeal and Shopclues – will Adani One, which, in the travel space already faces competition from MakeMyTrip, EaseMyTrip, Booking.com etc – be able to make a dent in the full ecommerce play? Industry analysts say if Adani jumps into a new business, at least a big splash can be expected. But eventually if will boil down to how much and how long one stays invested in a new business idea. Gautam Adani sure has the pockets, but does he have the D2C appetite? We’ll have to find out.",

        "content": "From Australia to China, private US companies to other non-governmental organisations and individuals, the search for MH370 became a global obsession New Delhi: One of the most enduring mysteries captivating mass consciousness for around a decade now has been the disappearance of the Malaysia Airlines flight, MH370. While flying over the South China Sea, the aeroplane mysteriously disappeared from radar screens. Since then it has become a topic of fascination as a modern enigma which has been surrounded by numerous conspiracy theories, conjectures and attempts at discovery. It is again in the news after an expert has made a claim that he ‘found’ the MH370 plane deep inside the Cambodian jungle using Google Maps. The news of another claim of finding the plane, while yet officially unsubstantiated, has again led the world to be caught by the MH370 fascination bug and the internet is ablaze. Story of the plane’s disappearance Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was an international passenger flight operated by Malaysia Airlines that disappeared from radar on 8 March 2014. It was flying from Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia to Beijing Capital International Airport in China before its disappearance. The causes of its disappearance and where it went have still not been determined. The crew of the aeroplane last communicated with air traffic control around 38 minutes after takeoff. The craft was flying over the South China Sea at that time. The aircraft’s final transmission was an automated position report which indicated that the aircraft was flying at its assigned cruise altitude of flight level 350. It lost touch with the surveillance radar screens minutes later but was tracked by the Malaysian military’s primary radar system for another hour, deviating westward from its planned flight path. With all 227 passengers and 12 crew aboard presumed dead, the search for the missing aeroplane became the most expensive search in the history of aviation but the Malaysian Ministry of Transport’s final report from July 2018 was inconclusive. Mystery has world obsess over answer After the plane’s disappearance, multinational search efforts began in the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea. These were later extended to the Strait of Malacca and Andaman Sea. From Australia to China, private US companies to other non-governmental organisations and individuals, the search for MH370 became a global obsession. The aircraft’s crew did not relay any distress signal before its disappearance. Neither there were indications of bad weather nor any prior technical difficulties were reported, so theories have abounded over what happened to the flight. The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has been described as “one of the biggest mysteries in modern aviation history”. Our fascination with it has been extreme and we have not been able to let go with finding an answer. Several documentaries have been produced on its disappearance, from the Smithsonian Channel to the Discovery Channel Broadcast and a three-part Netflix docuseries, MH370: The Plane That Disappeared, on the ninth anniversary of the flight’s disappearance. While many reasons can be given as to why our near-obsession with finding the truth about MH370 remains, some aspects of this remain inexplicable. Mysteries such as these have often catered to segments of society which feed off hidden truths and conspiracies theories. Many such incidents have existed and while the general public forgets about them, some are forever stuck finding answers. Currently, the case with MH370 though seems to be different. It has been able to hold the world’s attention for so long and this is not certain restricted to just isolated segments of conspiracy theorists. A major reason that can account for this is that after the plane’s disappearance, the search event became a global effort. A large number of countries came together and pitched in their efforts to find any clues about what happened to the plane. This large concentrated effort also makes it hard for everyone to let go of finding an answer. The internet age also contributed in making the plane’s disappearance a globally known phenomenon whose details were on the internet for everyone to know. This aided by internet fueled conspiracy theories have also made it hard for the story to be erased from the public consciousness. While the current news of the find using Google Maps has not been officially verified, it just goes on to show that the mystery will remain to haunt us and we as a global community are not letting go of it anytime soon.

        "description": "Chinese automaker Hozon Auto has started taking pre-orders for the Neta L’s pure electric variant in its home market. The new electric SUV’s pre-sale prices fall between 129,900 and 159,900 yuan (approx. €16,800-€20,700), depending on the trim.",
        "content": "The Neta L is available in three purely electric variants. The official market launch is scheduled for the end of June, with deliveries starting in July. , the carmaker already presented four equipment variants of the Neta L EREV (Extended Range Electric Vehicle) with a price range of 129,900 to 159,900 yuan. At 4,770 mm long, 1,900 mm wide, and 1,660 mm tall, the Neta L electric is a mid-size SUV. It’s a five-seater model with a 2,810 mm wheelbase, and it offers 583 litres of luggage space, which can be increased to 1,434 litres by folding the second-row seat. Select configurations even include a frunk with an additional 67-litre storage space. Based on the indigenously developed ‘Shanhai’ platform, the Neta L is available as a range-extender EV and also a fully electric vehicle. The latter employs a single permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) in the rear across the range. This motor produces 170 kW (231 PS) and 310 Nm of torque, letting the EV hit 0 to 100 kph in 7.6 seconds and achieve a top speed of 180 kph. The Neta L EV features cell-to-body (CTB) technology, in which the battery cells are part of the vehicle body, enhancing stability and safety. CATL’s Shenxing LFP battery cells are standard in the electric SUV, and they give it 68 kWh of energy storage capacity, allowing it to cover a distance of 510 km on a full charge, as per CLTC. These battery cells support ultra-fast charging, so increasing the charging level from 10 to 80% capacity takes as little as 21 minutes. On the outside, the Neta L packs features like dynamic turn signals (front and rear), electrically deploying flush-fitted door handles, a panoramic sunroof with electrically operated sunshade, and 19-inch alloy wheels wrapped in 225/55 R19 Michelin e.Primacy tyres. Inside, a widescreen digital instrument cluster, two 15.6-inch touchscreens (centre and passenger-side) combined in a single frame, a 64-colour ambient lighting system, and a refrigerator built into the centre console are some of the highlights of the new electric SUV. The Neta L offers great comfort in the front with a 10-way power-adjustable massage seat for the driver and a 14-way zero-gravity power-adjustable massage seat for the passenger. Both front seats include memory, ventilation, and heating functions, a wing-type headrest, and lumbar support as well. The front passenger seat features even leg support adjustment. Rear-seat passengers can enjoy heating and two-position (117°/122°) recline functions. The Neta L EV will launch on the domestic market at the end of June. Mass deliveries of the electric SUV in China will start in July. ,",

        "content": "Abu Dhabi-based education technology leader Alef Education announced the price range for its initial public offering (IPO) on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) today. The company also revealed the commencement of the subscription period for potential investors. Alef Education set its offering price range between AED 1. 30 and AED 1. 35 per share. This translates to an expected market capitalization of between AED 9. 10 billion (US$2. 48 billion) and AED 9. 45 billion (US$2. 57 billion) at the time of listing. The company will offer 1. 4 billion ordinary shares, representing 20% of its issued share capital. The total offering size is expected to range between AED 1. 82 billion (US$496 million) and AED 1. 89 billion (US$515 million). The proceeds from the IPO will not go to Alef Education itself, but rather to its existing shareholders, Tech Nova Investment and Kryptonite Investments. Alef Education, a provider of AI-powered learning solutions, boasts a strong track record in the UAE. The company serves all public schools in the Emirates and has a presence in a select number of international markets. It also has a long-term contract with the Abu Dhabi Department of Education and Knowledge (ADEK), guaranteeing fee collection for the next seven years. The subscription period for the IPO opened today, May 28th, 2024, and will close on June 4th for individual investors. Institutional investors will have an extra day, with their subscription period ending on June 5th. The final offer price is expected to be determined after the book-building process concludes. Following the IPO, Alef Education has pledged to distribute a minimum dividend of AED 135 million for each of its financial years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025 to all shareholders excluding the selling shareholders. This translates to a projected dividend yield of approximately 7. 42% at the top of the price range and 7. 14% at the lower end. If Alef Education successfully completes its IPO, it will be the first education technology company to list on a UAE exchange. The offering is seen as a significant development for the UAE's growing technology sector and education reform efforts.",

        "content": "Bedroom Drought: Not Having Lula Lula Causes Private Parts to Shrink and Become Elastic, Experts Warn Experts have warned that Gen Zers are not having lula lula as much as they should and this could hurt their body parts. According to experts, Gen Zers of legal age are having relations less than any other generation in history and this could lead to their private parts shrinking. Also read: Shurugwi Woman Pours Hot Cooking Oil On Her Husband For Starving Her Of Lula Lula Decline Lula Lula Among Gen Zers According to a recent survey by California University in 2021, 38% of people aged 18-30 reported not having relations in a year. Experts caution that abstaining from lula lula for extended periods can have detrimental effects on their genitalia. Dr Tara Suwinyattichaiporn, a sex and relationship expert, explained that most people need affection, touch, and sexual connections with others. Without these, mental health can deteriorate, leading to increased anxiety, sadness, and stress. Also read: A Deadly Concoction: Man Dies After Consuming Lula Lula Enhancing Concoction, Traditional Healer Arrested How Not Having Lula Lula Causes Private Parts to Shrink For men, prolonged lack of lula lula may result in a rare condition called penile atrophy. Dr Suwinyattichaiporn explains this occurs when the penile tissue becomes less elastic, causing a man’s joystick to shrink by 1-2 centimetres. Her warning was echoed by Tobias Kohler, an assistant professor of urology at Southern Illinois University, who states that without regular erections, a man’s joystick will lose elasticity and become smaller. In more severe cases, both men and women may experience vaginal/penile atrophy and pain during lula lula after going at least five years without intercourse. Additionally, lack of ejaculation may increase the risk of prostate cancer, as regular ejaculation helps flush out harmful chemicals that build up in semen. Also read: Married Woman Gets Juju From Madzibaba, Catches Her Husband Stuck During Lula Lula How Lula Lula Helps Prevent Prostate Cancer A 2016 study found that men who ejaculated at least 21 times a month had a lower risk of developing prostate cancer compared to those who ejaculated four to seven times a month. For women, lack of sexual activity can cause vaginal atrophy, leading to discomfort and pain during intercourse. Regular sexual activity increases blood flow, lubrication, and elasticity of vaginal tissues, preventing these issues. Experts continue to study the exact timeline for the development of penile and vaginal atrophy. Still, the consensus is clear: regular intercourse is important for both mental and physical health.

        "content": "Pakistan captain Babar Azam is on the cusp of breaking a world record held by Virat Kohli in the 3rd T20I between Pakistan and England on Tuesday. New Delhi: Pakistan captain Babar Azam is on the verge of breaking a world record held by Team India star Virat Kohli in the upcoming third T20I against England on Tuesday, May 28. Pakistan will lock horns with England in the third T20I of the ongoing 4-match series between the two sides at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff. Pakistan will be looking to bounce back to winning ways to keep the series alive after a 23-run defeat in the 2nd T20I. While the first T20I was washed out due to rain, England successfully defended the total of 183 runs in the second T20I to go 1-0 up in the three-match series. The hosts rode on captain Jos Buttler’s brilliant knock of 84 runs to post a strong total on the board before their bowlers produced an excellent effort to bundle out Pakistan for 160 runs and wrap up a dominant win. Babar was the second-highest run-getter for Pakistan in the 2nd T20I as he ended up scoring 32 off 26 balls. However, the Pakistan skipper failed to notch up a big knock to take his team home. Babar is now on the verge of breaking an all-time record held by Kohli and will be looking to achieve the elusive feat during the third T20I in Cardiff. Babar needs only 51 runs to surpass Kohli in becoming the leading run-getter of all time in T20Is. Kohli has 4037 runs under his belt in 117 T20I matches for India whereas Babar has notched up 3987 runs for Pakistan in 118 T20Is. If the Pakistan skipper manages to score 51 runs in the third T20I on Tuesday, he will overtake Kohli in the elite list. Most runs in T20Is: Virat Kohli – 4037 runs Babar Azam – 3987 runs Rohit Sharma – 3974 runs Even if he fails to notch up 51 runs in the third T20I, Babar needs only 13 more runs to become the first Pakistan batter and the second overall to complete 4,000 runs in the shortest format of the game. Babar has been one of the most prolific run-getters for Pakistan in T20Is ever since making his debut in the shortest format in 2016. Pakistan look to avoid series defeat against England After suffering a 23-run defeat in the second T20I, Pakistan will be looking to bounce back to avoid a series defeat against the hosts. With the first T20I getting washed out, a win in the third T20I will give England an unassailable lead of 2-0 in the four-match series. Pakistan batters will look to step up after their disappointing show in the 2nd T20I.",

        "content": "The Liberal Democrat Leader is set to outline his proposals to hold the water industry to account during a visit to the Lake District today. Under the party’s plans, local environment experts within the community would sit on the water company boards as non-executive directors to “improve public accountability and transparency”. The experts would also be expected to hold community meetings to report back on action being taken. In the run-up to the General Election, the Lib Dems have unveiled plans to abolish Ofwat and introduce a new water regulator to tackle the sewage crisis, in addition to banning water CEO bonuses. According to the Environment Agency, sewage spills into England’s rivers and seas more than doubled in 2023 with 3.6 million hours of spills last year – equal to about 400 years – compared with 1.75 million hours in 2022. Sir Ed said: “Water companies are getting away with this national sewage scandal whilst Conservative MPs and ministers have just sat on their hands. “These disgraced firms are destroying our treasured lakes and rivers with their filthy sewage dumping – hitting human health, harming our precious environment and damaging the local tourism economy all at the same time. “Enough is enough. It’s time to get tough on the water industry and a key part of that change must be new ways to hold these firms to account, putting power in the hands of the local communities suffering from this scandal. “Local environmental experts on company boards could hold water bosses’ feet to the fire and local people would finally have a say in how their water company is run. “Liberal Democrats will have the boldest manifesto plans to end the sewage scandal – from a tough new regulator to a ban on greedy exec bonuses to holding water bosses properly to account. “This election will be about saving our country’s precious environment for the next generation, not least in special places like the Lake District.” Sir Ed is visiting the Lake District, where protests have taken place outside the office of water company United Utilities, after it was accused of pumping sewage into Unesco protected lakes. According to Liberal Democrat analysis of Companies House records, United Utilities has made £2.3 billion in operating profits since 2019 and paid their top executives over £2 million in bonuses.",

        "content": "Paris: It was an emotional evening at Court Philippe-Chatrier as the 'King of Clay' Rafael Nadal made a shocking first round exit from Roland Garros after losing to Alexander Zverev. Nadal’s legacy of record 14 Roland Garros titles is a testament to his sheer quality and industry on clay. At 37, the Spaniard has an illustrious career in tennis to look back at, as he moves closer to retirement which seems imminent, considering his injuries. Even as Alexander Zverev claimed a straight sets victory over the Spaniard, hearts went out to Nadal who, might as well, played his last match of the Grand Slam ever. \"It’s going to be the last time I’m here in front of all of you. I’m not 100% sure, but if it was the last time, then I must say I enjoyed it. The feelings that I have today are difficult to describe in words. For me, it was special to feel the love of the people in the place that I love the most,\" said Nadal while addressing the spectators in the stadium. \"I have gone through very tough two years in terms of injuries. I went through that recovery process only to be back at Roland Garros. To leave after the first round was not an ideal return. But I have to accept it. I was competitive and I had my chances. But it was not enough against a great player like Sasha (Alexander Zverev),\" he averred. He did give the spectators something to cheer for while mentioning a possible return to Court Philippe-Chatrier for the upcoming Paris 2024 Olympics. \"What you all have made me feel here, it’s unforgettable. I hope to see you again. Merci Beaucoup!\" he conlcuded.",

        "content": "What is the hype behind day trading? Why is every other person talking about day trading? All we know is day trading means buying and selling financial instruments like stocks, currencies, futures, etc., but within a span of a single trading day. This is known to be the fastest way of trading but is considered to be a potentially lucrative pursuit. It is not like a long-term investment, where you buy and hold the commodity till the time its price surges, and you sell it for a higher price. In this trading, you depend on the equipment (technology) you use to take a chance in the market in a timely manner. To make it simpler to understand, let’s give you an example of a Formula One racer racing in a rusty old car. Guess who will win the race? Obviously, the F1 guy. The old car racer needs a finely tuned engine to win the race, just the way a day trader needs an advanced set of tools and platforms to compete in the financial markets. For what purposes will the tools and platforms be beneficial for the traders? The technology you will use will help you with your day trading endeavors. It will help you access live market data, perform trades quickly and efficiently, analyze market trends, and identify opportunities. What Factors Add To The Success Of Day Trading? Let’s define a successful day trade before diving into the tools needed for successful day trading. A winning day trade involves entering and exiting a position within the same trading day, profiting from a price movement that aligns with your prediction. This can involve buying a stock at a low point and selling it later in the day at a higher price, or vice versa (short selling) if you anticipate the price to fall. To achieve consistent success in day trading, a deep understanding of the financial markets is paramount. This knowledge encompasses two key areas—understanding the market dynamics and technical analysis. Successful day traders develop a keen sense of how various factors influence market behavior. This includes economic data releases, company news events, geopolitical situations, and even investor sentiment. Technical analysis involves studying historical price charts and market indicators to identify potential trading opportunities. Day traders utilize various technical indicators like moving averages, RSI, and Bollinger Bands to gauge market momentum, support and resistance levels, and potential trend reversals. Knowledge alone isn’t enough. Successful day traders translate their market understanding into actionable trading strategies. These strategies outline specific entry and exit points for trades based on technical analysis and defined risk parameters. Here’s the crucial part: you don’t just develop a strategy and blindly follow it. Before risking real capital, successful day traders “backtest” their strategies using historical market data. This allows them to evaluate the strategy’s potential performance and identify any flaws before deploying it in live trading. The market environment is dynamic, and successful traders continuously refine their strategies based on experience and changing market conditions. Even with a deep understanding of the markets and a well-defined trading strategy, success in day trading hinges on two crucial factors—discipline and risk management. The fast-paced nature of day trading can be emotionally charged. Witnessing sudden price swings can trigger impulses to chase gains or panic-sell at a loss. However, successful day traders cultivate ironclad discipline. They adhere to their pre-defined trading plan, avoiding the temptation to deviate based on emotions. This means entering and exiting trades based on your strategy’s signals, not fleeting feelings of fear or greed. Risk management is the nail in the coffin of any successful day trading operation. Every trade carries inherent risk, and the key is to limit your potential losses. This is where stop-loss orders become essential. A stop-loss order is an automated instruction set with your agent to sell a security if the price reaches a predetermined level. By setting stop-loss orders on every trade, you establish a maximum amount you’re willing to lose on that particular position. While it might mean missing out on some potential profits, it prevents catastrophic losses that could wipe out your entire account. Successful day traders also utilize other risk management techniques, such as: What Are Some Essential Tools You Can Use For Day Trading? As we said earlier, one must equip themselves with the right resources to be a successful day trader. If you want to be well-equipped for day trading, follow our three-dimensional approach, which comprises reliable hardware, live market data feed, and a good trading platform. Let’s have a look at how these can help your day trading go from zero to millions or even billions. What do you perform trade with? A computer, so reliable computer hardware, means an engine of your trading machine. There are multiple checks to make to ensure that you have a reliable system to operate. To make the engine work, consider the following checklist: Just like a pilot needs real-time weather data to fly the plane safely, day traders depend on live market data to make good decisions. A good market data feed provides live quotes, breaking news, and market analysis. You need access to constantly updating stock prices, currency exchange rates, and other relevant market data. Some of the popular data feed providers are Bloomberg, Reuters, and IQ Feed. However, if you want to stay informed about market-moving news events further, you can gain valuable insights from technical analysis tools like Ethereum code offered by some data feed services. Do you know what a trading platform offers you other than currency exchange or commodities? Well, a trading platform acts like a central hub for executing trades. However, it further analyzes the markets and manages your portfolio on your behalf. Here is why you should consider a trading platform: You get access to the charting tools. The advanced charting capabilities will give you a detailed and effective technical analysis. You have to look for a platform that offers different chart types, technical indicators, and drawing tools to help you look for trading opportunities. Popular charting platforms like TradingView can be integrated with some brokers. To be successful in day trading you need a smooth way of order placement and execution. You must ensure your platform allows for various order types (market orders, limit orders, stop-loss orders) and fast order routing for swift trade execution. Some platforms offer built-in research tools like fundamental analysis reports, company news feeds, and earnings calendars, allowing you to make well-rounded trade decisions. Popular platforms with extensive research resources include TD Ameritrade’s Thinkorswim and Interactive Brokers’ TWS platform. Some Popular Day Trading Platforms Having explored the essential tools, let’s discuss the best day trading platforms. Choosing the right platform is crucial, as it directly impacts your trading experience and efficiency. Here’s a list of some popular options: Summing Up Equipping yourself with the right tools and platforms is an essential first step for aspiring day traders. Reliable hardware, real-time market data, and a well-featured trading platform form the foundation for informed decision-making and efficient order execution. Remember, the “perfect” platform doesn’t exist – it depends on your individual needs and trading style. Beyond the tools, consider supplementing your knowledge with educational resources and joining online communities of experienced day traders. Continuous learning and a supportive network can be invaluable assets on your day trading journey.",

        "description": "The industry regulator Ofwat is set to reject most water companies’ requests to increase consumer annual bills, it is claimed",
        "content": "Industry regulator Ofwat is set to reject most water companies’ requests to increase consumer bills, it has been reported. Ofwat is due to announce its draft decisions on its 2024 price review which will set the levels of service water customers can expect and the bills they will pay for 2025 to 2030. The announcement, which comes amid mounting public anger over water companies’ handling of sewage pollution, will also include a decision on Thames Water’s bill increase and spending plans. What have water firms asked for? Water firms in England and Wales have reportedly declared they want to increase bills by between 24 per cent and 91 per cent over the next five years, according to a consumer watchdog. That is despite sewage spills into England’s rivers a nd seas more than doubling in 2023. Southern Water is asking for the biggest increase of 91 per cent, which would mean its customers’ bills would rise from the current level of £479 to £915 per year, according to the Consumer Council for Water (CCW). South Staffordshire and Cambridge Water are requesting the lowest rise – of 24 per cent – which equates to a £43 rise in their bills. What is Ofwat expected to say? A hotly anticipated review of how expensive water bills could be over the coming years has been pushed back because of the general election Ofwat has delayed publication of its decision on pricing until 11 July from an original date of 12 June. The consultation will see Ofwat give its initial verdict on water companies’ business plans until the end of the decade, which it does every five years. But according to The Guardian , the regulator is poised to refuse most water companies’ requests to raise consumer bills, with some getting only half of what they want. The regulator says the new price controls set as part of its 2024 review will still come into effect on April 1 2025, despite the later publication date for its draft decisions. What does this mean for bills? It’s not yet clear which companies have had their requests turned down or how much of their proposed bill increases have been rejected. But according to The Guardian , Thames Water’s request to increase bills by 59 per cent to £749 a year have been rejected by Ofwat, with sources describing the firm’s business plans as “fag-packet figures” and a “microwave job”. They added that Thames Water’s board members were determined to “sit on a deckchair on the Titanic”. A Thames Water spokesperson said: “Ofwat has announced that its draft determination will be delayed until after the general election in July and so any comment about its content before that would be premature”. Why is Thames Water in trouble? The future of Britain’s biggest water firm, Thames Water , could hinge on the decision with the giant the most heavily indebted of England and Wales’ water companies. When the company was privatised in 1989, it had no debt, but has since borrowed heavily. Thames Water has a roughly £15 billion debt and, along with the other water companies, has become embroiled in a scandal over water pollution. It faces potential nationalisation after investors rowed back on a promise to provide extra funding, putting the company’s finances in the balance. Thames has asked Ofwat to allow it to hike customer bills over the next five years to help it invest in its infrastructure and balance the books. What about other utility bills? Households across England, Wales and Scotland are set to pay less on their energy bills from July after energy regular Ofgem has announced its quarterly price cap . Read Next How the 'triple lock plus' would affect your pension The average household energy bill is to fall by 7 per cent after Ofgem lowered its price cap in response to wholesale prices. The typical household’s energy bill is set to fall from the current £1,690 a year to £1,568. This will be £500 less than the cap in July last year, when it was £2,074, but Labour have pointed out it is still £400 more than in 2021. And analysts have warned the regulator could increase the price cap on bills in October. The Tories have said they would keep the energy price cap in every year of the next parliament and introduce improved customer service to help consumers find cheaper energy bills and drive up competition. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said, if elected, a government led by him would set up Great British Energy, a new publicly owned energy company, which would “invest in homegrown clean energy to boost energy independence and cut bills for good”.",

        "content": "HONOR has announced two new smartphones , the HONOR 200 series. The devices that were announced are the HONOR 200 and HONOR 200 Pro . HONOR announced the two phones in China, as this is their initial launch. Both are expected to launch globally too, though. The HONOR 200 series is official, and the phones are coming to global markets Chances are that both smartphones will be identical globally, but with different software, of course. So this initial launch does reveal all the detail that you may be wondering about. If you take a look at the two devices below, you’ll see that they’re similar, but also different. You can easily tell which is which by their display holes. The HONOR 200 has a display camera hole, while the HONOR 200 Pro has a pill-shaped cutout on the display. Everything else is very similar, though. They both have curved displays with very thin bezels. There’s also an oval camera island on the back, in the top-left corner. Their backplates are rounded at the very edges. In regards to specs, these are mid-range phones, but very powerful mid-range phones... especially the HONOR 200 Pro. Let’s talk about that device first, shall we? The HONOR 200 Pro is fueled by the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 SoC The HONOR 200 Pro includes a 6.78-inch 2700 x 1224 OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate.

An in-display fingerprint scanner is also a part of the package. The phone also includes a set of stereo speakers, and Bluetooth 5.3. It measures 163.3 x 75.2 x 8.2mm and weighs 199 grams. The HONOR 200 Pro’s pricing starts at CNY3,499 ($483) in China. The HONOR 200 has a 120Hz display & Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 chip The vanilla HONOR 200, on the flip side, has a 6.7-inch 2664 x 1200 OLED display. That panel is also curved, and it also has a 120Hz refresh rate. It gets just as bright as the HONOR 200 Pro panel, and it has the same 3,840Hz high-frequency PWM dimming. The Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 fuels this smartphone, while both 12GB and 16GB LPDDR5 RAM models are available. Those two variants include 256GB and 512GB of internal storage, respectively.

        "content": "A gut health expert has issued a warning about a popular supplement. Sea moss has gained in popularity due to its high fibre content. However, Chris Dubberley said there were \"hidden dangers\" of sea moss, particularly its iodine content. Chris has urged consumers to approach it with caution due to its potential implications for gut and thyroid health. Chris said: \"Sea moss supplements are gaining popularity for their supposed health benefits. Although the high fibre content in sea moss could benefit digestion for some, too much may cause gastrointestinal discomfort, such as bloating and diarrhoea. \"The iodine found in sea moss also poses some concern for gut health. Although it’s necessary for thyroid function, too much iodine can upset the balance of gut bacteria, leading to gastrointestinal problems, as well as - ironically - hypothyroidism. \"Sea moss also includes prebiotics, which support gut health by growing helpful bacteria. However, too much prebiotic can worsen symptoms for those with certain gut conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). \"Taking care of your gut health needs a personalised approach. Everyone has a unique digestive system with their own dietary likes, sensitivities, and health conditions. This is important to keep in mind when thinking about trying sea moss supplements. \"Before picking sea moss supplements, be careful because the iodine content can vary greatly between products. It's important that these supplements have clear labels showing how much iodine they contain so people can make informed decisions about their health.\"",

        "description": "China's former Olympic champion swimmer Sun Yang has reiterated his ambition of coming back to compete as strong as ever after his doping ban of over four years finished on Tuesday.",
        "content": "China's former Olympic champion swimmer Sun Yang has reiterated his ambition of coming back to compete as strong as ever after his doping ban of over four years finished on Tuesday. Sun, a former three-time freestyle Olympic champion, technically regained his eligibility to compete in an official race again on May 28 after completing a suspension of four years and three months, issued by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, that took effect from Feb 28, 2020. Sun, who turned 32 in December, said during an exclusive interview with ThePaper.cn that he's never given up on his athletic career throughout the tough years and he's ready to come back as a competitive swimmer again. \"I'd decided four years ago (when the suspension was imposed) that I would not quit. Now I just hope to be back in the pool and to step back on the starting blocks again as soon as possible,\" Sun said during the interview. Sun's controversial doping case dated back to September 2018 when a dispute with testers from IDTM, a FINA-hired agency, over the authorization of a random out-of-competition drugs test at his residence in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province escalated into a physical confrontation. Swimming's world governing body World Aquatics (then known as FINA) ruled in January 2019 that Sun's refusal to cooperate was reasonable based on results of an independent panel's investigation that found the IDTM testers failed to show adequate proof of identification and authorization, as claimed by Sun. Two months later, the World Anti-Doping Agency appealed the FINA ruling to CAS, resulting in an 11-hour public hearing in November 2019 in Swiss city Montreux. There, a panel of three judges determined Sun was guilty and imposed the eight-year ban in February 2020. The Swiss supreme court set aside the ban in December of that year following a successful appeal by Sun's attorney that challenged the neutrality of Franco Frattini, chairman of the original CAS panel, who was deemed to display anti-China bias in comments posted by the Italian on social media. The second hearing, as required by the Swiss court, took place in May 2021 overseen by a new panel of judges, who found that Sun \"had acted recklessly\" when he refused to let anti-doping officials leave his home with a sample of his blood. Sun had repeatedly protested his innocence during the protracted legal dispute. He claimed that he refused to cooperate only after finding testers were operating without adequate ID proof and were taking photos of him without his permission during what was supposed to be a confidential procedure. The Lausanne-based CAS announced in June 2021 to reduce the initial eight-year ban into four years and three months, citing rule amendments that allow flexibility to assess the \"entirety of the circumstances\". \"At the beginning (of the suspension), I suffered a lot emotionally and mentally, feeling nothing but darkness. My parents almost tried to satisfy every one of my demands at that moment, worrying that I would suffer a mental problem,\" Sun confessed. \"Then slowly and gradually, I managed to come out of the shadows, learned to appreciate and enjoy other things in my life, got married, went back to university to continue my academic studies. \"Looking back now, I feel I've gained a lot more than what I've lost during the four years. \"Now I've left it all behind, made peace with what happened in the past and am ready to give it a go again,\" said Sun, who won two gold medals (400m and 1,500m free) at London 2012, followed by a 200m gold at Rio 2016.",

        "content": "China Eastern Airlines on Tuesday took delivery of its sixth C919 jet, as the domestically developed large passenger aircraft celebrates the 1st anniversary of commercial operations. C919 jets have reportedly carried nearly 300,000 passengers during the past 12 months, accumulating over 6,000 incident-free flight hours, achieving preliminary success in commercial operations. Industry analysts said the mass production and delivery of C919s is advancing steadily, projecting Chinese aircraft manufacturers may reach the same level as international industry leaders by 2035, in terms of aircraft production capacity and technical support and maintenance. On Tuesday morning, a C919 aircraft numbered B-919G departed from Shanghai Pudong International Airport and landed at Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport shortly. The plane formally joined China Eastern Airlines' fleet, according to a press release the airliner sent to the Global Times. This is the first of a purchase order of 100 C919s that China Eastern Airlines signed with Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) in September 2023, the company said. Since the C919's inaugural commercial flight on May 28, 2023, its commercial operation has picked up speed. Over the past year, the aircraft began flying routes between Shanghai and Beijing, operating across the Chinese Lunar New Year travel rush and debuted at the Singapore Airshow. A chartered flight from Hong Kong to Shanghai is scheduled for Jun 1, which will mark C919's first overseas commercial flight, according to China Eastern Airlines. Analysts said large-scale operation of C919s is significant to promote China's competitiveness in the global aviation market. \"Over the past year, C919's commercial operations made notable progress, carrying a large number of passengers and conducting test flights on more routes. Especially, the aircraft's debut at the Singapore Airshow underlies COMAC's resolve in exploring international markets,\" Wang Yanan, chief editor of Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge magazine, told the Global Times on Tuesday. In addition to China Eastern Airlines, other major domestic carriers such as Air China and China Southern Airlines have also announced purchase of C919s from COMAC. To date, global orders of C919 have exceeded 1,000 aircraft, Xinhua News Agency reported. \"Currently, C919 has sufficient orders while the C929 project has begun, which points to the sound development of the country's air transport and aircraft manufacturing sector,\" Qi Qi, an independent market analyst, told the Global Times on Tuesday. Qi calls for the accelerated development of aircraft industrial and supply chains domestically, especially stable supply such as engines and avionics, in a bid to boost the mass production of C919 jets. COMAC Deputy General Manager Qi Xuefeng said in November 2023 that the C929 aircraft has entered its detailed design stage. The manufacturing of large aircraft should give play to the activity of domestic and foreign suppliers, but we should strive to achieve a safe and self-controllable industrial and supply chain at the most for the mass production of every aircraft model, Qi said. It's expected that Chinese aircraft manufacturers will reach the same level as international giants such as Boeing and Aircraft as early as 2035 in terms of output, technical support and maintenance, Wang said. He said the progress made by the C919 is a vivid display of China's fruitful results in high-end manufacturing, and the continuing momentum will help the country retain its leading position in global competition. China has demonstrated its strong momentum and broad prospects in the development of new quality productive forces. China's first domestically produced large cruise ship, Adora Magic City, started commercial operations in January this year, another showcase of the country's manufacturing prowess.",

        "content": "Message from His Excellency Dr. Omar Alieu Touray, President of the ECOWAS Commission Esteemed Ladies and Gentlemen, Citizens of ECOWAS Member States, Today marks the 49th anniversary of the signing of the treaty that gave birth to the Economic Community of West African States. Over nearly half a century, ECOWAS has stood as a beacon of regional cooperation, fostering shared prosperity and unity among our diverse peoples. As we commemorate this milestone, let us reflect on the remarkable achievements that ECOWAS has accomplished. From facilitating the free movement of people to promoting intra-regional trade, enhancing energy and transport infrastructure, advancing governance, and bolstering peace and security, ECOWAS has made tangible strides toward our collective vision of a peaceful and prosperous region. Yet, even as we celebrate our successes, we cannot ignore the challenges that persist. Insecurity remains a pressing concern, with some member states grappling with the daily threat of terrorism and the resulting displacement and food insecurity affecting large segments of our population. In the face of these challenges, our unity is paramount. It is our collective strength that will enable us to overcome adversity and safeguard the integrity of our community. As General Yakubu Gowon, one of ECOWAS’ founding fathers, aptly remarked, the breakup of our community would be a grievous disservice to past, present, and future generations. Therefore, let us rally together under the theme of “Strengthening Regional Unity, Peace, and Security.” This theme underscores the urgent need to preserve the unity and peace envisioned by ECOWAS’ founding fathers and reaffirms our commitment to working tirelessly toward these cherished objectives. I extend my heartfelt appreciation to our leaders, past and present, as well as to the dedicated members of our community and our valued partners, both local and international. It is through our collective efforts and unwavering unity that we will secure the peace and stability of our member states and pave the way for the harmonious socio-economic development of our region. In unity, there is strength. Let us remain steadfast in our resolve to uphold the ideals of ECOWAS and ensure a brighter future for generations to come. On this auspicious occasion, I wish our ECOWAS community and all its members a joyous anniversary. Long live ECOWAS! Long live African unity!",

        "content": "Bhopal: The Madhya Pradesh government has ordered the closure of 66 nursing colleges across the state, three months after the Madhya Pradesh High Court's order over 'irregularities' in affiliation. The state's medical education department has issued a circular to district administration asking them to comply with the order. The action follows the directives of Chief Minister Mohan Yadav, to take strict action. The state government said that the Madhya Pradesh High Court has declared these colleges 'unsuitable', and subsequently, action for shutting them has been taken. The government, however, has also made it clear that students enrolled with these 66 colleges would not be affected. \"Students of these colleges would not be affected. Their exams would be conducted,\" a statement from the medical education department, read. The development came even as the nursing college scam case is being heard in the high court. The case is about large-scale irregularities and corruption in nursing colleges. The CBI has been carrying out the investigation. The CBI had submitted its reports (charge sheet) on 308 nursing colleges, while the probe in another 300 nursing colleges was underway. Meanwhile, two officials of Madhya Pradesh Police -- inspectors Sushil Kumar Majoka and Rishikant Asathe, who were earlier attached to the CBI -- were arrested two weeks ago. Their arrest on an alleged bribery charge has raised multiple questions about the authenticity of the probe. The nursing college scam was exposed in 2021 and it reached the Madhya Pradesh High Court in 2023.",

        "description": "Molly-Mae Hague’s sister Zoe has said the reality star “can’t do right from wrong” after she was criticised for booking a Ryanair flight for her hen after treating her best friend to a private jet.",
        "content": "‘I think it’s quite sad that she’s had to turn the comments off on that video’ Molly-Mae and Zoe on their way to Ibiza Molly-Mae Hague’s sister Zoe has said the reality star “can’t do right from wrong” after she was criticised for booking a Ryanair flight for her hen after treating her best friend to a private jet. Molly-Mae had organised the “best weekend ever” for her sister Zoe as she whisked her and ten friends off to Ibiza to celebrate on the party island. But critics were quick to point out that the 24-year-old fiancé of Tommy Fury had used a private jet in March to take her best friend Tayla on a four-day ski trip in France to celebrate her birthday. It attracted comments such as, “your friend gets a private jet for her birthday but your sister doesn't for her hen's party? I'd be raging.” Another sniped: “Makes me giggle that her mate got a private jet but it's Ryanair for her sister.” Zoe defends her sister But now, Zoe has uploaded a new YouTube video where she declared: “I don’t need to say anything, I’m sure you guys know me well enough now to know what I think about that.” Referring to Molly-Mae, she added: “Poor girl can’t do right from wrong, she really can’t. I think it’s quite sad that she’s had to turn the comments off on that video.” She ended by saying: “Peace and love over here, peace and love only, no hate, I love my sister and she loves me.” When she was then asked if she wanted a staycation or a hen do abroad she answered: “Let’s just go abroad, I feel like everyone needs some sun at this time of year as well, the only thing is when we looked at flights ages and ages ago, the flights were about £520.” “Obviously, £520 for a return flight is a lot of money, however, Molly was so generous and very kind and said that no one has to pay for anything else, that’s literally all they’ll have to pay for then potentially a little bit of spending money. “I didn’t know all of this until we got there, but everyone was really generous and chipped in where they could. “My friends that just paid for their flights also all sent me a bit of money to send to Molly as like a thank you and a little bit of a contribution towards the food and stuff.” “So, all in all, it cost about £700, which for some people for a hen do is quite a lot, I know it is quite a lot, but they were all saying ‘For the experience we’re gonna get and for the villa that we’re staying in and the food we’re getting and drinks that we’re getting’, they were reasonably happy to do it.” “I did check with everyone before we booked anything to check this was going to be okay for everyone and it was.” “A lot of the questions were ‘How did you split everything?’ ‘How did you pay bills at the end?’ and we’re very fortunate that we didn’t have to and that Molly did get the majority of it,” she explained. Last week, a frustrated Molly-Mae Hague said she “can't win” after she was criticised for booking Ryanair. The sisters having fun on the hen Molly-Mae uploaded a video to her YouTube channel to address the backlash where she said she “can't win” no matter what she does. She even joked she will “swim, bike and run” to her next location to keep her critics happy. “People talking about how they thought it was crazy that I booked my sister a Ryanair flight to take her on her hen do,” she says in the video. “They're like 'I can't believe Molly booked a Ryanair flight for her and her sister's friends when a few weeks before she got her friend a jet. “The amount of stick and the amount of intense comments I got from doing that treat for Tayla's birthday and getting the jet, made me think I probably won't ever do that ever again. “It takes away that specialness of that experience because the reaction is just, so not worth it.” She added: “Because if I fly commercial, well, it was actually making me feel like I was the worst sister in the entire world. Then, if I fly private, it is genuinely not worth it because it's all I hear about for that next few weeks. “What I'll do is I will do a triathlon. You will see me swimming, biking and running to my next location. She wrapped up by saying: “There's so much going on in the world right now? A, why do people even care? and B, you can't win, you can't actually win. No matter what I do people are going to comment about it. In March, the star jetted 12 friends off on a private jet for a luxury getaway to mark her bestie Tayla Blue's 30th birthday in France. The former reality star surprised Tayla just a week before they flew out to the French Alps with an envelope saying the pair were going skiing. The influencer had organised for Tayla's husband, their baby, her sister and other friends to come along on the trip. Molly-Mae's fiancé Tommy Fury, their baby daughter Bambi, 14 months, and Molly's sister Zoe Hague also joined the celebrations. Tayla was seen walking onto the private jet with Hague before all their friends yelled surprise from inside the plane cabin.",

        "content": "Astronomers have characterised a number of extreme worlds in a new catalogue, including sub-Neptunes, sub-Saturns and super-Earths. Such discoveries are expected to get increasingly common as exoplanetary science moves from one of discovery to one of characterization. Multiple papers have been published based on the catalogue. New Delhi: After three years of research, scientists have assembled the largest single catalogue so far characterising exoplanets. Such large catalogues are expected to get increasingly common in the future. The catalogue contains 120 confirmed exoplanets, and six exoplanet candidates that require follow-up observations to be confirmed. Contained in the catalogue are many weird and wonderful worlds, including a super-dense planet designated as TOI-1824 b . A paper describing the catalogue has been published in The Astrophysical Journal Supplement . Supplementary papers on individual systems include TOI-1347 b that possibly has an atmosphere, TOI-1386 a system with a transiting sub-Saturn as well as a non-transiting exoplanet with a mass comparable to Saturn, a sub-Neptune in orbit around TOI-1437 , a sub-Neptune with the designation of TOI-1751 b in orbit around a primordial, metal-poor star, and the super-dense sub-Neptune TOI-1824 b mentioned above. TOI-1386 The TOI-1386 system has a pair of known exoplanets orbiting a star that is similar to the Sun. The first of these is a sub-Saturn, a planet that straddles the size gap between Neptune and Saturn. TOI-1386 b is the first planet discovered in the size range, and scientists did not previously know that such worlds even existed. TOI-1386 b orbits the host star in 26 Earth days, while its companion, a planet of similar mass to Saturn takes 227 days to orbit the host star. One of the study authors, Michelle Hill says , “There is ongoing debate about whether sub-Saturn planets are truly rare, or if we are just bad at finding planets like these. So, this planet, TOI-1386 b, is an important addition to this demographic of planets.” TOI-1437 b TOI-1437 b is also in orbit around a star similar to the Sun, with each year lasting 19 Earth days. This is a sub-Neptune, a world larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. One of the study authors, Daria Pidhorodetska says , “Planets smaller than Neptune but larger than Earth are the most prevalent worlds in our galaxy, yet they are absent from our own Solar System. Each time a new one is discovered, we are reminded of how diverse our Universe is, and that our existence in the cosmos may be more unique than we can understand.” What is interesting about this system is that the host star is of a similar mass, age and size as the Sun, allowing for an apples-to-apples comparison. This system enables an apt comparison between the Solar System and other star systems. The catalogue contains exotic exoplanets that are in even tighter orbits around their host stars. TOI-1798 c TOI-1798 c is in orbit around an orange dwarf star. The exoplanet is a sub-Neptune with an orbit of around 12 hours, or half a day. This is one of the few systems known with an inner planet that has an ultra-short period orbit. Lead author of the catalogue paper, Alex Polanski says , “While the majority of planets we know about today orbit their star faster than Mercury orbits the Sun, USPs take this to the extreme. TOI-1798 c orbits its star so quickly that one year on this planet lasts less than half a day on Earth.” The exoplanet is in such a close orbit around the host star that it receives 3000 times more radiation than the Earth receives from the Sun. The intense stellar radiation would have stripped away any atmosphere on the planet. The proximity of the host star also suggests that the exoplanet is tidally locked, with a day side always oriented towards the Sun, and a night side in perpetual darkness.",

        "description": "A total of 97,386 voters have registered to exercise their right to vote in advance on June 2, a source from the Ministry of Internal Administration (MAI) told Lusa agency.",
        "content": "According to MAI, early mobility voting, on Sunday, June 2nd, is allowed to all registered voters in the national territory, at a polling station of their choice and registration can be done until Thursday, the 30th. Portugal recorded, in the 2019 European elections, the worst abstention rate (68.6%) since belonging to the European Union, in contrast to participation in Europe - around 50%. To try to reverse this trend - in addition to the early voting of sick people, prisoners, and those abroad, or the mobility vote, on the previous Sunday (June 2nd) - this year there is a new modality, only possible because there are \"dematerialised electoral registers\". Any registered voter in Portugal can vote \"other than in the place where they are registered\", the spokesperson for the National Elections Commission ( CNE ), Fernando Anastácio, explained to Lusa on the 25th. \"You can choose without any pre-registration conditions, for example, you live in Lisbon, you are registered in Lisbon, but on the 9th you are in Porto, you can choose to go to any polling station in Porto: present yourself at the vote, identify yourself with your citizen card or a document that is considered valid for identification purposes and exercise your right to vote\", he said. The elections were scheduled at the European level for the period from June 6th to 9th. And this is, according to the CNE spokesperson, \"a particularly difficult period for Portugal\", as it coincides with \"a week that is usually a mini-holiday period. Around 373 million European voters are called to vote for the European Parliament between June 6th and 9th. In Portugal, voting is on the 9th. 720 MEPs will be chosen, 21 of which are Portuguese.",

        "content": "Now and then: from holding the Shakey’s V-League games to small venues to record-breaking attendance, the PVL–and Philippine volleyball–are certainly on the rise. MANILA, Philippines —From holding the game in small university gyms to hosting a Finals series with an average of more than 20,000 spectators, the Premier Volleyball League–and, in turn, the sport of volleyball–has come a long way in the Philippines. This was what longtime organizer Sports Vision had envisioned since it founded the Shakey’s V-League–where PVL traces its roots that started primarily as a collegiate preseason league–in 2004, and seeing drones of fans come to the PVL games now has left president Ricky Palou in awe of how volleyball in the country has evolved. “I remember if there were at leastm50 people watching, we’d already be so happy,” Palou told Inquirer following the success of the 2024 season’s first conference–which drew record-breaking numbers in live spectators during the PVL Finals. READ: Looking back at PVL’s ‘very successful’ 2023 “We started in 2004. There were few fans, but we noticed that slowly the number of spectators increased. Now we’re reaching 20,000 to 24,000. We’re happy about this.” Numbers, as they say, don’t lie and these record-setting crowd counts in the PVL can only be considered a testament to the continued rise of volleyball in the country. This photo of Philippine Army Lady Troopers celebrating the of the 2011 Shakey’s V-League Open Conference shows the beginnings of club volleyball competition in the Philippines. –AUGUST DELA CRUZ It all started when Sports Vision Management Group ventured into the volleyball scene with the Shakey’s V-League, which featured college teams playing at Lyceum, Blue Eagle Gym, and Rizal Memorial Coliseum in the mid-2000s. Eventually, club teams and military squads joined to form the Open Conference before the league was rebranded as the PVL in 2017. The league continued to grow with current clubs Creamline, the most successful with eight titles, Petro Gazz, and Choco Mucho with games now being regularly played FilOil EcoOil Centre in San Juan, Philsports Arena, and Mall of Asia Arena. READ: ‘Right time’ to turn pro for PVL; players excited The PVL decided to turn professional in 2020, making it the first volleyball league in the country with pro status, and drew defunct Philippine Superliga teams like Cignal, PLDT, and Chery Tiggo. The first-ever pro tournament inside the bubble in Bacarra, Ilocos Norte was ruled by the Crossovers, led by sisters Jaja and Dindin Santiago-Manabat, after beating the Cool Smashers behind closed doors at PCV Socio-Civic and Cultural Center. When the COVID-19 restrictions were slowly lifted, the PVL returned in 2022 with a semi-bubble setup at Paco Arena until it received a go signal to open its doors to the fans at FilOil and MOA Arena, thus signaling the rise of Philippine volleyball. Teams have come and go since then, but the PVL eventually managed to put up a 12-team field with Akari, Nxled, Farm Fresh, Strong Group Athletics, Capital1, and Galeries Tower joining the fray. A general view of the record PVL crowd during Game 2 of the Finals between Creamline and Choco Mucho at Araneta Coliseum. –PVL PHOTO The PVL shattered the Philippine volleyball attendance record after 24,459 fans watched Creamline’s title-clinching Game 2 win over Choco Mucho at the Big Dome last December in the second All-Filipino Conference, surpassing the previous high of 22,848 spectators between Ateneo and La Salle in the 2016 UAAP finals at the same venue. Creamline and Choco Mucho, two of the PVL’s most popular teams, met again for the second straight All-Filipino Finals and it was no surprise that the last game of the series came just over a 1,000 spectators short of the record with a 23,162 crowd count at Araneta Coliseum. READ: Just like the All-Filipino title, PVL attendance record stays put Seeing packed crowds even on a weekday, though, have become a common sight for the PVL, especially during the playoffs, with the championship opener drawing 17,457 supporters on a Thursday evening also at the Big Dome. On the final day of the semis last May 5, Close to 18,000 fans attended the game day when Creamline beat Chery Tiggo to return to the finals and Choco Mucho completed a three-game sweep after eliminating Petro Gazz. This was despite PVL’s simultaneous schedule with the PBA and the Final Four game between UST and La Salle in the UAAP Season 86 women’s volleyball tournament where 19,505 spectators came to see the Tigresses dethrone the Lady Spikers to end a five-year Finals drought. PVL’s final semis game started at 7:03 p.m. and ended at 9:11 p.m. whie the UST-La Salle match was played from 6:09 p.m. to 9:01 p.m. Palou and the organizers are honored to receive such a huge following from Filipino sports fans, who have been taking the PVL to greater heights as one of the main sports in the country. “We’re amazed at how the fans have come to like volleyball and appreciate the game of volleyball. I guess they find it exciting so we’re very happy and elated that the number of volleyball fans is increasing,” said the Sports Vision president. Celebrities like Vice Ganda and Willie Revillame, PBA players, other Filipino athletes, and other personalities have been part of PVL’s enthusiasm over the past two years. A game between the PVL’s biggest crowd draws–Choco Mucho Flying Titans and Creamline Cool Smashers–in the PVL All-Filipino Conference Finals. –MARLO CUETO/INQUIRER.nbet More than the skills and charisma of the league’s fan favorites like Alyssa Valdez, Jema Galanza, Deanna Wong, Sisi Rondina, Mika Reyes, Eya Laure, and other stars, Palou believes the formula for the PVL’s continuous rise is the excitement and intensity of the games and the parity of the competition. “Fans what to see good games between teams and everything is fair and transparent, that’s the formula there, ” Palou said. “They come to watch because they enjoy the games.” “In the last championship game, I was sitting beside a lady I asked: ‘Who are you rooting for her, Choco Mucho or Creamline?’ She said, ‘’Sir, I’m cheering for Creamline.’ But when Choco Mucho scores, she would still cheer,” he added. READ: PVL: Creamline, Choco Mucho grateful for overwhelming support from fans “So I said, ‘I thought you were cheering from Creamline?’ She said: ‘Sir as long as the plays and hits are good, we’re also excited.’ It’s exciting. They like a good match.” But as the league grows, so do the expectations to keep the level of competition high and the audience engaged–which is what the PVL is looking to address as soon as possible. A good place to start would be a Rookie Draft. “We just wanted to make sure that everything would be fair. Because we’re transparent, we don’t really want one team to dominate, we’d like all to be competitive and everybody will have a chance to win a championship. What we’re really looking at really is the fair officiating and everything,” Palou said. “What we’d like to see is the other clubs make their teams more competitive so that all games can attract a good number of spectators. Now what you see is if they know the game will be on sided, fans tend now to attend. What we really want is all teams will be very competitive.” READ: PVL looks to address player tampering to preserve league harmony In the first rookie Draft set for July 6, the college stars and other aspirants are expected to boost the rosters of the bottom four, Strong Group Athletics, Capital1, Galeries Tower, and Farm Fresh. The move was borne out of recent developments in the PVL when the more established teams pulled off off recruitment sprees and signed young collegiate stars who were still far from using up their eligibilities in the collegiate leagues. Packed crowds for both the PVL and UAAP volleyball games has PNVF saying that volleyball is now the Philippines’ top sport. At the rate that the fanbases of the teams in the PVL are growing and how venues are filled for the games also in the UAAP volleyball tournaments, Philippine National Volleyball Federation president Tats Suzara claimed that volleyball has already surpassed basketball as the country’s top sport. “Volleyball is now the number one sport among spectators in the Philippines, not basketball. I said this to boss MVP (Manny V. Pangilinan), and he said, ‘that’s a lot, 46 thousands [fans] in one day?'” said Suzara. “So I told him, volleyball is a family entertainment sport All ages, families, boyfriends-girlfriends, father and mother. So I think, it’s a sport that’s really made for families,” said Suzara. “If you will see the difference, in my experience, the basketball — Fiba World Cup was more on the players’ experience. But for volleyball, it’s the fan experience. Players cooperate with the fans, they welcome interviews. So I think it makes volleyball now the number one sport in the world and the Philippines, of course,” he added. And the Philippines’ latest success in the AVC Challenge Cup, where the newly-named Alas Pilipinas women’s squad has made history, has only added to the interest of the nation in volleyball. The tightly knit Alas Pilipinas celebrates a four-set win over Iran in the AVC Challenge Cup 2024 Saturday night. —MARLO CUETO/INQUIRER.net Despite limited preparation, Alas Pilipinas swept four games in Pool A to reach the semifinals — the farthest a Philippine team reached since joining the tournaments of the Asian Confederation in 1961. The young Alas Pilipinas, led by captain Jia De Guzman and go-to scorer Angel Canino, won their games in front of electric 5,000 fans at Rizal Memorial Coliseum every night despite the rainy weather in their last two games. The tickets for the Philippines’ semifinal game against Kazakhstan on Tuesday were sold out as the Filipino Spikers hope to make a historic entry to the Final. READ: For just P15,000 each to play, Alas Pilipinas earns fans’ hearts This is exactly how Palou thinks volleyball can solidify itself as the Philippines’ no. 1 sport–through excellence in international tournaments–and the country may have just taken the first step towards that. “If we do relatively well in the international scene, if we can be competitive in AVC tournaments we think it will improve the following of volleyball. Our target is for the national team to do well in the next Southeast Asian Games, which is next year,” Palou said. The last time the women’s squad won a Southeast Asian Games medal was in 2005, while the men’s players earned a historic silver medal in the 2019 edition.

        "content": "The South Korean government is ramping up discussions on specific tax incentives aimed at enhancing the market value of local companies, with plans to conduct public hearings over the next two months. “We talked about tax incentives for the Value-up Program on several occasions. But now is the time for us to discuss more specific plans,” Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok told reporters on Monday. “Throughout June and July, we will host public hearings to deliberate specific tax incentives,” Choi said. The government’s Corporate Value-up Program aims to incentivize listed firms to bolster their value, thereby improving their market value and addressing the so-called “Korea discount” issue. “Korea discount” refers to Korean companies being seen as comparatively undervalued due to various factors. However, the recent release of a vague guideline lacking binding force and specific incentives to boost participation has drawn criticism. READ: South Korea proposes tax cuts to stimulate corporate investment Choi mentioned that the hearings will cover various incentives discussed in the market, including separate taxation of dividend income, corporate tax credits for increased dividends, and the abolition of inheritance tax surcharges for major shareholders. “From the perspective of the effectiveness of incentives, the more benefits, the better. However, an excess could compromise fairness. We’ll strive to strike a balance,” he emphasized. The top finance policymaker revealed that the open hearings will occur two to three times over the next two months. In the initial session, options will be refined, with subsequent discussions aimed at finalizing incentive details. Choi also noted that discussions on inheritance tax will be included in the hearings. South Korea has the world’s second-highest inheritance tax rate at 50 percent, with a 20 percent “management premium” surcharge for major stakeholders at large firms, elevating the rate to the world’s highest, at 60 percent. “In regard to the inheritance tax law, there are various proposals, from eliminating the surcharge for major shareholders to expanding family business inheritance deductions and enhancing benefits for Value-up companies,” he explained. “We will narrow down options through public hearings and incorporate them into the tax law amendment.” READ: S. Korea readies financial support for small businesses, builders Monday’s briefing marked Choi’s inaugural monthly press conference, a move aimed at enhancing communication with the media and the public. During the session, he addressed various queries, including clarifying the government’s position on the short-selling ban. “To reintroduce short selling, we need regulatory enhancements to combat illegal practices, including the implementation of a monitoring system,” he emphasized. “With the ban set to continue until June, we aim to clarify our resumption plans by the end of the month for market stability. Earlier that day, Financial Supervisory Service Governor Lee Bok-hyun suggested that the short-selling monitoring system’s development could conclude in the first quarter of next year, suggesting a potential lift of the ban around that time. Choi also disclosed the government’s plans to support the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises by extending the period for receiving benefits from three years to five years. Additional measures to assist them post-extension will also be introduced. These measures will be unveiled in early June as part of the government’s “dynamic economy road map,” outlining its economic policy vision. Regarding inflation, Choi reiterated the government’s positive outlook. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

        "content": ", business development manager for federal and artificial intelligence at (NYSE: DELL), said government agencies that intend to implement AI at the edge should consider adopting to quickly glean insights from data while ensuring the security of critical data. In an article published on , Hicks noted that federated learning could enable agencies to leverage larger datasets at a decreased bandwidth. “Federated models require significantly less bandwidth than other models because the information isn’t being sent back to a data center for processing,” he wrote. “If an agency has a rich dataset in the cloud and a small amount of compute at the edge, it can use federated learning to train the edge device without having to move all the data from the cloud.” Hicks cited some of the key considerations for agencies that plan to apply AI at the edge, including the need to identify the end goal of the AI or a machine learning model. “Other key questions include how much data an agency is trying to process and how quickly it needs the results,” he added. The Dell Technologies executive discussed how the company works to help agencies that intend to incorporate AI at the edge, such as creating a roadmap for AI implementation, providing federated learning and analytics tools to agencies and finding ways for agencies to make the most of their data. “We also provided a validated, containerized solution that agencies can use to quickly and easily deploy a federated learning solution in a Kubernetes environment,” Hicks added.

        "content": "Champion mare Imperatriz smashed the record sale price for an Australian broodmare as Yulong splashed a cool $6.6 million to land the 10-time group 1 winner at the Magic Millions on the Gold Coast on Tuesday. Imperatriz wasn’t on the market until she reached the previous record of $5 million, set by Milanova in 2008, as Yulong went head-to-head with Coolmore for the world’s highest-rated mare and sprinter. Imperatriz in full flight winning the William Reid Stakes at Moonee Valley last year. Credit: Racing Photos Bidding opened at $4 million and stepped up in $250,000 increments until $6.5 million when a final online bid of $6.6 million from Zhijun Zhao, a friend of Yulong owner Yuesheng Zhang, did not have a reply. “These are rare commodities,” Yulong boss Vin Cox said. “There are very few horses that win 10 group 1s. So she’s in the top half-dozen, certainly, the top 10 mares of all time. The Zenyattas, the Sunlines, and things like that come to mind, but she punches with there with them.” Te Akau boss David Ellis described Imperatriz as the best horse he had ever raced, and that was reflected in the record price – which came on the back of Winx’s first filly fetching $10 million at the Inglis Easter Sale . The price was further proof of the buoyant Australian thoroughbred market, with the sale grossing more than $50 million on its opening day. Cox believes Australian mares are now starting to bring their true value. “I’ve always thought mares in Australia are undervalued compared to the Northern Hemisphere,” Cox said. “If you look at what elite mares can make in America or Europe, we’ve always been – in my view – about half price. Conversely, our stallions are probably valued more than they are in the Northern Hemisphere.” Yulong also added TJ Smith Stakes winner Chain Of Lightning to the mix for its Everest slot, paying $2.5 million for her earlier in the day. There had been talk of a trip to Royal Ascot and perhaps a Tatts Tiara shot for Chain Of Lightning, but the Fighting Sun mare is likely to be spelled and race on. “We will probably give her a break, and bring her back for the spring and see how she shapes up,” Cox said. “She has won a pretty big race in the TJ and usually those sprinters run well in the Everest.”",

        "description": "Nearly a third of carbon emissions come from the food and agriculture sector, but switching what foods you buy could cut your household's contribution by a quarter.",
        "content": "Swapping meat lasagna for vegetarian isn't just healthier for you — it's also healthier for the planet. And a new study shows just how much each swap, like switching beef for chicken in stew, saves greenhouse gas emissions. Switching food and drink purchases to very similar but more environmentally friendly alternatives could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from household groceries by nearly a quarter, according to the George Institute for Global Health and Imperial College London study shows in a new study. The study released Tuesday aims to show that consumers do not have to make drastic changes — like giving up meat — to make smarter, climate-conscious choices that aggregate to make an impact on carbon reduction, lead author Allison Gaines tells CBS News. \"But while consumers are increasingly aware of the environmental impact of the food system and willing to make more sustainable food choices, they lack reliable information to identify the more environmentally friendly options,\" said Gaines, who has a doctorate in public health. The study recommends that packed food items be labeled with carbon emissions so that climate-conscious consumers can make informed choices. Around a third of carbon emissions are currently attributed to the food and agriculture sector. Researchers calculated the projected emissions of annual grocery purchases from 7,000 Australian households using information from FoodSwitch, an app from The George Institute where users can scan the barcode of a food item and see other similar, healthier options. Out now, but only in Australia, EcoSwitch aims to add one more component for customers to consider – the carbon emission of the product. The data collected in the study is featured in the app where customers can scan a product and see similar ones with a lower carbon emission. Gaines said previous studies analyzed dietary patterns whereas her research aims to \"look at food the way that consumers look at it at the supermarket.\" The study offered two kinds of swaps – those that can be found on the same shelf compared to swaps that can be found in a different aisle. These similar swaps can lead to emission reduction of 26% in Australia equivalent to taking 1.9 million cars off the road, according to the study. Stunning photos of climate change 72 photos For example, a chocolate chip brioche roll could have a \"very similar switch\" to a dinner roll or a \"less similar switch\" to a sourdough loaf. With beverages, a sugar-free vanilla cola can be switched for a \"very similar\" raspberry soft drink or a \"less similar\" ginger-lemon kombucha. The switches that are better for the environment often correspond to ones that are better for your health, Gaines said. The top contributors to carbon emissions from food products were meat and meat products , at 49%, followed by dairy and nonalcoholic beverages. \"The way that emissions are trending around the world is looking worse and worse,\" said Gaines. \"Empowering people with that information from the bottom up often also has an impact from the top down.\" In: Climate Change Food & Drink Agriculture",

        "content": "The European Union delegation in Afghanistan has announced that 200,000 euros, equivalent to 15.5 million Afghanis, have been allocated to recent flood victims in Afghanistan. According to a report by the European Union published on Monday, May 27, this amount of money will aid 28,000 people in provinces affected by the floods. The Union’s statement mentioned that the allocated funds would be sent to the western, northern, and northeastern provinces. The European Union delegation also added that these aids include cash, shelter, and health services to ensure that the basic needs of the affected individuals are met. The northeastern, northern, and western provinces of Afghanistan have witnessed devastating rains and floods in the past month, resulting in hundreds of deaths and significant financial losses. The European Union had previously announced that it would provide 400,000 euros in assistance to flood victims. The humanitarian situation has worsened significantly amid the forced deportation of Afghan migrants from Pakistan and Iran. Thousands of Afghan migrants, many of whom have lived in these neighboring countries for decades, are being forcibly returned to Afghanistan. This mass deportation exacerbates the already dire conditions in Afghanistan, where resources and infrastructure are severely strained.

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email In today’s digital age, the intersection of technology and ethics continues to draw attention. I recently had the pleasure of interviewing Taehyung Yoo, the CEO of Mirrorboard, who is also at the helm of the innovative startup, Melting Pot AI . Yoo shared insights into his unique journey, from social campaigner to tech entrepreneur, and his vision for a symbiotic relationship between AI and the arts. Can you introduce yourself and tell us about your background before founding Melting Pot AI? I am Taehyung Yoo, the CEO of Mirrorboard , currently operating Melting Pot AI. Before starting my own company, I was a campaigner interested in various social issues and led numerous campaigns. To address the low birth rate in South Korea, I organized a massive speed dating flash mob called ‘Solo Conquest’ with the participation of ten thousand singles. Additionally, to highlight issues with wages and employment, I initiated a project called ‘Yoo Taehyung for Sale,’ where various companies bid on my annual salary, creating an issue by rejecting the highest bid. In the ‘Do You Know Obama?’ campaign, I managed to deliver a letter to President Obama through a friend of a friend, suggesting the possibility that everyone can be connected to the highest powers. These experiences motivated me to start my own startup. I wanted to demonstrate that businesses can grow by consumers choosing products with the right values. Melting Pot AI is a natural extension of the social campaigns I have previously conducted. What inspired you to start Melting Pot AI, and what stands at the core of your business philosophy? Melting Pot AI is a startup founded with the goal of solving all inefficiencies and problems in the world. Our core vision is the ‘coexistence of artists and AI,’ a concept naturally formed during the process of identifying opportunities in the market. The unique reason we developed the generative AI platform, Melting Pot AI, is because we place greater importance on ‘conscience’ and ‘courage’ than others. Initially, we quickly entered the market using generative AI models. Our first product was a prompt marketplace, and our second was a stock image creation service that produces images resembling real photos. This stock image service became popular, especially among marketers and creators looking for royalty-free images. However, after achieving success, we began to deeply consider the impact of AI replacing the roles of traditional photographers, models, and studios in their lives. During this process, we learned about the decline in revenues for stock image creation communities and platforms like Shutterstock and Getty Images. It was particularly shocking to learn that artists at Shutterstock were receiving a one-time payment of $0.01 per image. Further discussions revealed that designers, composers, and writers working for gaming and content companies were being laid off en masse. This situation highlighted the harsh reality of AI replacing human jobs, causing us to feel significant guilt. As we delved deeper into this issue, we questioned whether generative AI was evolution or robbery. Our team extensively researched the social and cultural impacts of AI, discovering not only that AI threatens the jobs of artists, but also that it faces significant sustainability issues, such as the ‘model collapse phenomenon.’ Ultimately, we concluded that it is necessary to create an ecosystem where AI and artists can protect and develop together. To this end, we are moving towards a system that respects artists’ works and ensures appropriate compensation, enabling AI technology to enhance the creativity of artists. Melting Pot AI pursues this vision, aiming to create greater cultural value by fostering a sustainable way for AI and artists to develop together. How does the opt-out mechanism function within Melting Pot AI, and what are the technical and ethical challenges associated with implementing such a system? Melting Pot AI employs a robust system to rapidly identify matches between the artworks submitted by artists and the datasets used by other generative AI developers. We actively monitor these AI developers and conduct periodic verification requests to companies included in our monthly list. This monitoring is crucial to determine whether the data of Melting Pot AI members has been used without authorization and to actively demand that such data be opted out from the AI training datasets. Currently, there is no mandatory requirement for AI companies to disclose their training data. However, with the impending implementation of the EU’s AI Act, which will likely mandate greater transparency in the use of training data, our monitoring activities are set to become more vigorous. Once the AI Act is fully operational, it will enable more proactive enforcement of data usage standards, ensuring that the rights of artists are protected and that their contributions are not used without proper authorization and compensation. This proactive approach not only helps maintain the integrity of artists’ work but also sets a precedent in the industry for responsible and ethical AI development practices. In what ways has the recently published EU AI Act influenced your approach to building an ethical AI platform, and how does Melting Pot AI go beyond basic compliance? Melting Pot AI is a project that was prepared in anticipation of serious AI and copyright issues before the EU announced its AI Act. The significance of our project lies in creating a platform system that inherently ensures that the generative AI used is legal, rather than merely ‘proving’ its legality. The AI Act briefly addresses copyright issues, stating that data must be collected in compliance with copyright law. Many AI companies will refer to ‘fair use’ in this context. Fair use allows the use of copyrighted data without the consent of the copyright owner, but it must serve a public purpose and not infringe on the rights of the copyright holder. The Napster case is a notable reference for this. Over the past year, there have been lawsuits filed by artists against generative AI companies. Not once have artists won these cases, and generative AI companies have been adamant in asserting their legality based on this principle. Melting Pot AI is completely free from these problems. Artists directly participate in our platform, give their consent, and provide the data for learning themselves, thus eliminating the need for us to prove fair use. How do artists typically engage with the platform, and what strategies have been effective in encouraging their participation and trust in the system? Artists can easily engage with Melting Pot AI by uploading the works they want to provide as training data. After the upload, the AI training and subsequent royalty settlements are automatically processed. In simple terms, artists just need to upload their work, wait, and then receive their compensation. Additionally, artists who upload their artwork can access the website’s forum and connect with other artists worldwide and with Melting Pot AI’s HQ directly. To foster trust among artists, we offer an additional service: an AI copyright management service. This service periodically monitors whether the works submitted to Melting Pot AI are being used for training by other AIs. If any unauthorized use is detected, the service will handle opt-out requests and claim compensation on behalf of the artist. Once the AI Act is enforced, AI companies will be obligated to disclose their training data. We plan to gather the artworks from our artists and officially inquire about potential copyright violations to other generative AI companies. This proactive approach not only protects our artists but also reinforces the integrity and transparency of our platform. How does Melting Pot AI respond to the challenges posed by other platforms facing legal scrutiny for uncompensated use of creative works? At Melting Pot AI, we provide royalties to artists based on the ‘actual use’ of their data. For example, if a photo of a deer is generated through Melting Pot AI, royalties are paid to the artist who provided the original deer photo used in training the AI. The settlement method plans to adjust up to 80% of the AI’s net profits to the artists. This generous royalty model not only ensures that artists are fairly compensated for their contributions but also aligns with our vision of supporting and fostering a sustainable ecosystem where artists and AI can coexist and thrive. This approach demonstrates our commitment to ethical AI practices and respect for artistic contributions. What specific measures are you taking to ensure transparency, accountability, and fairness in AI governance across Melting Pot AI’s operations? Melting Pot AI takes thorough measures to ensure that only genuine artists who actively engage in creative activities are admitted as members. Additionally, we employ an internal engine to monitor the data pool collected through artists, ensuring that there are no cases of copyright infringement or duplicate data. One of our most valued principles is ‘fairness.’ We believe that simply calculating royalties based on the rate of data used in training is not equitable. This is because some artists may provide popular images, others might provide very rare images, and some might provide common and ordinary images. To address this, Melting Pot AI employs a technology that tracks the raw data used every time an image is generated to accurately assign royalties. This feature is unique to Melting Pot AI and uses our proprietary technology called 2layered labeling, which significantly reduces the computing power needed compared to traditional GDI (Generic Data Inversion) technologies for tracing raw data. This system ensures a more equitable distribution of royalties, recognizing the unique contribution of each artist’s work. Are there specific partnerships or collaborations that Melting Pot AI is pursuing to broaden the impact of ethical AI practices in the industry? Melting Pot AI is not only focused on developing its own generative AI but also aims to instill a sense of copyright sensitivity throughout the entire industry. We believe that any company interested in adopting Melting Pot AI’s ethical generative AI development methodologies should be able to collaborate with us in business. This open approach helps spread ethical practices and standards across the AI industry, encouraging other companies to prioritize artist rights and fair compensation. By sharing our methodologies and technologies, we aim to create a more responsible AI landscape where innovation coexists with respect for intellectual property and artistic contributions. How do you see ethical practices influencing the evolution of generative AI technologies, especially in the context of artistic creativity? As the market for generative AI grows, various technical issues arise, including the phenomenon known as “model collapse.” A significant problem is the decreasing availability of data for AI to learn from, which is primarily created by artists. From the perspective of AI development, protecting artists is not merely optional—it’s essential for the continuous advancement of AI technology. By ensuring that artists are incentivized to keep producing high-quality, original content, AI systems can have access to diverse and robust data pools that enhance their learning and functionality. This symbiotic relationship highlights the importance of establishing and maintaining ethical practices within the AI industry. It stresses the need for a framework where both technology developers and creative individuals benefit mutually, ensuring the sustainability of both AI innovation and artistic creation. This approach not only supports technological advancement but also upholds the value and rights of the artists contributing to these advancements. What exciting or innovative applications of Melting Pot AI’s ethical platform can we expect to see shortly? For effective model training in AI, a substantial amount of data is required. Melting Pot AI plans to begin its first model training only when the collection reaches 100 million images submitted by artists. This massive dataset is essential to ensure that the AI can learn from a broad and diverse range of inputs, which enhances the model’s ability to generate high-quality and varied outputs. To achieve this goal, we encourage a large number of artists to participate and contribute their creative works. Each submitted image not only enriches the training set but also plays a crucial role in advancing the field of generative AI. By contributing, artists are not only supporting the development of cutting-edge technology but are also ensuring that their creative rights and contributions are respected and compensated within this growing technological landscape. Lastly, how do you see Melting Pot AI influencing the broader discussion on ethical AI and shaping the industry? Generative AI, like that developed by Melting Pot AI, represents a paradigm shift in how people engage in creative activities, much like the impact of the internet and mobile technology. As technology profoundly affects many people, there is an increased need for fairness and ethical consideration in its development and deployment. Melting Pot AI aims to set a precedent by establishing a point of connection between artists and AI, ensuring that as generative AI continues to evolve, it does so in a way that supports and includes the artistic community. This approach not only aids in the technological advancement of AI but also protects and promotes the creative rights of the artists whose work fuels these developments. By fostering a balanced ecosystem where artists are respected and compensated fairly, Melting Pot AI champions a model where innovation in AI goes hand in hand with ethical practices, setting a standard for the industry to follow. This ensures that as generative AI transforms creative processes, it does so while enhancing and not exploiting the contributions of human creativity. Yoo’s vision for Melting Pot AI encapsulates a future where technology and human creativity coexist in harmony, enhancing each other’s capabilities and ensuring that digital evolution remains inclusive and equitable. As the AI landscape continues to evolve, it is clear that ethical considerations will play a pivotal role in shaping its trajectory, with Melting Pot AI at the forefront of this transformation.

Brisbane's superstar prop was on the team bus to the Magic-Round clash against Manly two weekends ago when he heard that his father, Gregor, had been apprehended in the Philippines. For Haas, it was nothing out of the ordinary to press on through adversity, later compounded by a mid-game ankle injury in the 13-12 win. At only 24, Haas has already needed to process his mother's incarceration over her involvement in a fatal car crash, and last year saw his younger brother Zeda facing drug charges that were later withdrawn. Haas's priority in tough times has always been to his two younger brothers, who live with him, and his daughter. Payne Haas has broken his silence following his father's shock arrest in the Philippines Gregor Haas has been threatened with the death penalty following drug charges 'It's a bit of a tricky one. Obviously everyone knows what's happened,' said Haas, speaking to his father's situation for the first time. 'I'm just trying to look after my siblings and try and look after my family that I've got in Australia and try to make sure they're all right. Because what I'm going through, they're probably going through as well.' Through everything, footy has always been a safe space for Haas. 'Obviously I grew up in not the best circumstances,'' he said. 'But I always use sport or anything as a little escape from everything. I'm sort of used to it now and I just come into footy, and that's footy. I don't try and bring my outside personal life into footy. 'There's lots of people who have got things worse, and I've been through worse things in my life.' It's why missing State of Origin this year was never an option. The four-time Dally M Prop of the Year has become a walk-up starter for the Blues in recent years amid a dearth of other elite front-row options. He will partner newly minted captain Jake Trbojevic in the front row come June 5, with the Blues team picked on Sunday suggesting a game plan that will rely on winning the battle in the middle of the field. Payne Haas (left) and his father Gregor are pictured at the 2019 Dally M awards 'I want to be here,' Haas said. 'This is what you want to do and why you play rugby league growing up, you want to play State of Origin. It never crossed my mind not playing. I'm just privileged and blessed that I get to do that now.' The Broncos have supported Haas in his hour of need, with Haas singling out coach Kevin Walters, chief executive Dave Donaghy and education and welfare manager Adam Walsh as three pillars of support outside the playing group. 'There's so many people I can name at the Broncos. They've been so good for my family and I,' he said. But come Origin I, there'll be no love lost between Haas and Brisbane teammates Pat Carrigan, Selwyn Cobbo and Reece Walsh, who are lining up for Queensland. 'When we're on the field, there's no mates,' Haas said.

Tyson \"became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare-up 30 minutes before landing,\" his representative said in a statement on Monday. The representative added, \"He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him,\" adding that he is \"doing great.\" Tyson's flight was met with first responders when it landed at Los Angeles International Airport. According to a statement by the airline, first responders were sent \"due to the medical needs of a customer\". Tyson is set to fight YouTuber Jake Paul in a boxing match on 20 July 2024 at the AT&T Stadium in Texas. The fight will be streamed live on Netflix. Responding to fake news circulating about Tyson's health, Paul wrote on X , \"You love to make shit up before knowing the facts for clicks/likes. Nothing changed.\" In a post about the upcoming fight, Tyson wrote in a caption, \"Can't wait for Jake's wake.\" \"Titanium Jake will sleep Iron Mike.

The foundation stone of this building was also laid by Prime Minister Modi. This building was built in a very short time of 2 years and 7 months,” Birla said. He praised the building as a testament to India’s self-reliance and the aspirations of its 1.4 billion citizens. “Due to PM Modi’s visionary leadership, this building was constructed in a short period of time, reflecting the spirit of our self-reliant India,” Birla noted that the need for a new building had been long-standing, with both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha advocating for it,” Birla said. “There are new technologies in the new Parliament House and it’s eco-friendly too,” he added. The new Parliament House incorporates advanced technologies and eco-friendly features. Birla acknowledged that many former Speakers had also called for a new Parliament House over the years. He emphasized the legislative achievements within the new building, including the passage of the Women’s Reservation Bill. Birla expressed gratitude to the Prime Minister and the Home Minister for enacting and implementing the law to construct the new Parliament, describing it as a “justice code” rather than a penal code. “After independence, we made our laws in the new Parliament House. I want to thank the Prime Minister and the Home Minister, who, after independence, enacted the law for building our country’s new parliament and implemented it for the people. The law is not a penal code but a justice code. We have been advocating for years that there should be a new code to ensure justice for the people,” Birla said. “In this new parliament, there have been extensive discussions on the Ram Temple and on how India will be in 2047. Till now Lakhs of people have already visited the new parliament building. The construction of the Parliament House in a short time is historic in itself,” he added",

        "content": "The Junior Springboks will open their World Rugby U20 Championship campaign against Fiji at Cape Town Stadium on 29 June. The event, which features the 12 best Under-20 sides in the world, will be hosted in the Western Cape where games will be played in Cape Town and Stellenbosch. The venues for the matches will be Cape Town Stadium, Athlone Stadium and the Danie Craven Stadium in Stellenbosch. READ | U20 Rugby Championship: Coach Nhleko hails Junior Boks' grit in comeback win over Argentina The Junior Boks will also duel England and Argentina in Pool C. Pool A consists of defending champions France, Wales, New Zealand and Spain; and Pool B will feature 2023 runners-up Ireland, Australia, Georgia and Italy. \"Last year's tournament was an unforgettable experience and we’re expecting more of the same this year. With the recent U20 Rugby Championship, we saw how closely matched the four Sanzaar teams were, and it was the same in the U20 Six Nations, where England emerged victorious,\" said SA Rugby CEO Rian Oberholzer. \"To host the next generation of superstars next month is a great privilege and we can't wait to welcome their families, friends and fans to South Africa. \"The World Rugby U20 Championship plays an important role in the global rugby picture and is key in promoting and growing the game, while we are also excited to unearth the next generation of Springboks,\" Oberholzer added. The Junior Springboks will look to improve on their bronze medal from 2023. Meanwhile, the World Rugby U20 Championship 2024 will be the first international competition to feature the three new law amendments implemented to promote ball in flow and diversity of attacking options, while supporting player welfare. Players will no longer be put onside when an opponent catches the ball from a kick in open play and runs five metres, as players will be required to make an attempt to retreat. Scrums will also no longer be an option from free kicks, while World Rugby has also banned the crocodile roll. A package of six law trials will also operate, including the simplified red card sanction process, approved by the World Rugby Executive Board.",

        "content": "Nazi apologists, massacre perpetrators, grave robbers, racists and eugenicists were hugely influential across the entire history of the University of Melbourne , according to its own research. The university has published a shocking account of the dark side of these erstwhile heroes of Australian academia in a book it hopes will tell a greater truth about the institution and its dealings with Aboriginal people. Some of Australia’s most celebrated scientists, including a Nobel laureate and others of world renown – along with doctors, historians, anthropologists and other academic staff – advocated breeding out “lower” and “deficient” “races”, particularly Aboriginal people; others exhumed, collected and later concealed Aboriginal remains; while yet others supported nazism, even after the second world war. In one account a university graduate, Daniel Murnane, whose name until March this year graced a veterinary science scholarship, was among a group of men who perpetrated a 1926 massacre of Aboriginal people at Forrest River in the Kimberley. A subsequent royal commission into the killings confirmed that at least 11 Aboriginal people had been killed and their remains burned in three purpose-built stone ovens. View image in fullscreen The University of Melbourne in Parkville. Photograph: Agenzia Sintesi/Alamy But these words and deeds have, until now, been absent from their official biographies. Dhoombak Goobgoowana – translated as “truth-telling” in the Woi Wurrung language of the owners of the land on which the university was built – is the first of two volumes. The second is due early next year. With more than 60 contributors from architecture to zoology, its editors say it is a book about “some of the worst failings of our intellectual leaders” . “The university has supported injustices called progress, half-truths presented as facts, and prejudices pretending at objectivity,” they write, adding: “Although many things have changed, the stain of the past remains. The land has not been returned; racism persists in the institution.” The killing times: a massacre map of Australia’s frontier wars Read more Dhoombak Goobgoowana is the result of three and a half years of research and is the first work of its kind in Australia. It grew out of “the vision, commitment and activism of Indigenous leaders inside and beyond” the university, its vice-chancellor, Duncan Maskell, says, and it will shock those who have “too rosy a view” of the university’s origins. “We can no longer look away from this difficult history and its legacy, we need to face up to the effect this history has had and continues to have on the Indigenous community,” Maskell says. This is difficult but necessary, says the university’s official historian and one of Dhoombak Goobgoowana’s three editors, James Waghorne. History has left stuff out. We’re putting it back in Ross Jones Truth-telling is “supposed to cause discomfort”, he says. “University historians have tended to glide over and to tactfully avoid discussing certain elements of peoples’ past. I don’t think overlooking the most difficult parts of a person’s career and work is honouring them. “One of the questions I have received about this book is: is this somehow diminishing people? This book doesn’t aim to take down or diminish these people from the past. Rather, it hopes to explain their work, their priorities, the activities they undertook, in a more complete way.” His co-editor and fellow historian Ross Jones says no restrictions were placed on their research by the university leadership, though their findings have been troubling to some. The result, he says, is “good old-fashioned scholarship”. “Historians get very nervous when you talk about truth-telling because what is truth in history?” Jones says. “What I think is a better line, and I keep saying this all the time, is: this is not revisionist history. We are repairing revisionist histories of the past. “I see this as a restoration job, to a degree. History has left stuff out. We’re putting it back in.” View image in fullscreen Marcia Langton holds a copy of the book, Dhoombak Goobgoowana. She says truth-telling is vital everywhere. Photograph: Tamati Smith/The Guardian The book will shake the foundations of a revered sandstone institution, often voted the best in Australia, and ranked 27th in the world. But, the foundation chair of Australian Indigenous studies, associate provost and the third co-editor, Marcia Langton, says racism, dispossession and “racial scientism” have been at the core of the university since the first stone was laid in 1853, two years after the colony of Victoria was declared. The university’s luminaries have included “racists, thieves and body snatchers”, the authors say. The book pulls no punches in naming these men and their deeds. Racists, Nazi apologists and eugenicists Eugenics – the now-discredited belief that the social ills of modern society stem from hereditary factors, and solutions involve breeding out the “defective” – took hold at the university from its early days, Jones says, and persisted until into the 1970s. At Melbourne, this “science” was deeply infused with racism. “The university was very important in propagating this view that Indigenous Australians were the lowest of the low,” Jones says. “Some people thought they really weren’t even on the same evolutionary tree. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “[But] there were activists, right through history, who said this was wrong. We talk about them in the book. And I think it’s important to emphasise those people because that totally cuts away the ground from the argument that everyone thought like that, and we can’t blame anyone.” The anthropologist Sir Walter Baldwin-Spencer, a eugenicist who in 1912 was appointed as the guardian of every Aboriginal child in the Northern Territory , believed that “half-caste” Aboriginal children were genetically superior by virtue of their white blood and could be saved by removal. Views like these, widely propagated on campus for almost a hundred years, underpinned almost a century of law and the policy of forced removals of children that unleashed generations of pain and anguish on Aboriginal families and resulted in the stolen generations. In the early 1930s Augustin Lodewyckx, who taught Teutonic studies and languages at Melbourne, called himself a “proud Aryan”, said Hitler was a “German hero” and wrote about eugenics as the answer to the overbreeding of low-intelligence people. Merely deleting their names from buildings, rooms, courtyards and roads, and not explaining why, compounds the injustices with further acts of denial Dhoombak Goobgoowana Lodewyckx wrote in the Argus newspaper in March 1933 that Germany “may yet be the educator and perhaps the saviour of the white world”, unless Hitler’s successes were “eaten away by the mass of small human vermin”. The scholar and his family left Melbourne to spend eight months in Germany in 1933. His wife, Anna, told readers of the Argus in May that year: “It is worthwhile, and perhaps advisable, to give Adolf Hitler a chance of proving his worth.” Eugenicists, says Jones, persisted at the university even after the Holocaust. The Eugenics Society of Victoria was “effectively an offspring of the university”. “I found all these characters like Agar [Wilfred Agar, geneticist and dean of the science faculty],” he says. “They named the Agar lecture theatre in the 1990s. He was praising Nazi sterilisation laws after Churchill and Truman said that the ‘final solution’ was in progress. Agar was a Nazi sympathiser, and he was president of the Eugenics Society (from 1936 to 1945).” Its membership reads like a who’s who of the academic, judicial, scientific and educational elite of Melbourne society. In the society’s surviving subscription lists from the 1930s to 1947 are the names of such eminent individuals as the journalist and newspaper proprietor, Sir Keith Murdoch; the chief executive of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (the precursor to the CSIRO), Sir David Rivett; the university vice-chancellor Sir John Medley; the president of the Royal College of Physicians, Sir Sidney Sewell; the chief justice of the Victorian supreme court, Sir Edmund Herring; the university’s head of pathology, Sir Peter MacCallum; the supreme court justice, John Barry; and the founder of the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Rev GK Tucker.

Photograph: Medical History Museum Other academics were not members of the society but held similar views, Jones says. The “racist” views of the Nobel prize-winning microbiologist Frank Macfarlane Burnet – a founding member of the Australian Academy of Science who was the first Australian of the year in 1960 – were “an open secret”, he says. “But nobody’s written about it, and his official biographies don’t mention it.” Eugenicist views and scientific racism influenced other faculties, the editors say. Senior historians in the 1950s argued that there was no point teaching Indigenous history. John La Nauze, appointed to a second chair of history in 1956, said Indigenous people were of interest as specimens of prehistory but had made no contribution to modern Australia: “Unlike the West or South American Indians, unlike the Africans, the Australian aborigines could not even be exploited and enslaved. They could only be exterminated or driven further into the interior, or given, in charity, rations, cotton dresses, and religion. From them the Europeans could take nothing but the land they lived in.” These beliefs enabled the collection of Aboriginal remains to continue at the university unopposed for close to a century. Body snatchers and bone collectors Anatomists from the early days collected Aboriginal bodies and ancestral remains, proudly displaying their grisly discoveries – until they were required to hand them over for repatriation. As recently as 2002, it is alleged in the book, individuals at the university may have attempted to hide at least one collection to avoid a legal obligation to return remains to their descendant communities. The most prominent collector, Richard Berry, was a eugenicist who believed that mental capacity depended on the size of the head. He collected skulls from a wide range of “races” and published his theories of racial hierarchy. In one study he classed Indigenous adults as “feeble-minded”, in a cluster with criminals and the “mentally defective”. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Afternoon Update Free daily newsletter Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

View image in fullscreen The field camp of ‘amateur anthropologist’ George Murray Black in the 1940s or 1950s. Photograph: University of Melbourne archives The second major collection was gathered by George Murray Black, a Victorian pastoralist and “amateur anthropologist”. His collection of more than 800 individuals was raised from ancestral gravesites and sold to the university right up to the 50s. Even at the time, university anatomists urged collectors to be discreet. In 1944 the chair of anatomy, Sydney Sunderland (later knighted), warned Murray Black that “excavations must be carried out in isolated areas where there are no blacks present at the time”. In the 1980s the Gunditjmara elder Uncle Jim Berg took on the university about ownership of those remains and won a legal victory. Berg’s case led to an important change in Victorian legislation which made it illegal for the university to hold Aboriginal ancestral materials. In 1984 it was forced to hand over the Murray Black collection to the Museum of Victoria for repatriation. But it turns out the university still held hundreds of other remains which it failed to declare. As Jones writes in the book, more than 700 human skeletal remains collected by Berry were, by “either maladministration or passive resistance”, overlooked until 2002. When the Berry collection was finally liberated, the university apologised for the “hurt and understandable indignation felt by Indigenous Australians” and paid $172,000 towards the cost of repatriation and reburial. Massacre perpetrators and denialists The most disturbing tale of all is the revelation that a university researcher working in the Kimberley was involved in perpetrating the brutal massacre of Aboriginal men, women and children at Forrest River in 1926. View image in fullscreen Bones gathered at one of the three murder sites of the 1926 Forrest River massacre were buried beneath this cross, seen in a 1967 image. Photograph: Dr Neville Green A station owner, Frederick Hay, had been murdered by an Aboriginal man named Lumbia for the rape of his wife, Anguloo. In reprisal, police constables Graham St Jack and Denis Regan led a posse of 13 police and local white people to find Hay’s killer, taking along an arsenal of Winchester rifles, shotguns, 500 to 600 rounds of ammunition and 42 horses. They inflicted ruthless reprisal attacks on Aboriginal men, women and children. A royal commission into the killings confirmed that at least 11 Aboriginal people had been killed and their remains burned in stone ovens. One of the volunteers who rode out with the posse was Murnane, a veterinary scientist who had graduated from the University of Melbourne and was in the area researching buffalo fly for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. The university’s Ormond College offered a scholarship in his honour to support a rural or remote veterinary science student. ‘A very tragic history’: how the trauma of a 1926 massacre echoes through the years Read more Prof Kate Auty writes in Dhoombak Goobgoowana that Murnane was evasive during questioning at the royal commission, saying: “I don’t know”, “I have no knowledge”, “I have never heard” and “I cannot tell you”. The commissioner concluded that Murnane, like all the whites in the police party, had lied about the mass killings. Murnane found a staunch defender in a university professor, Alfred Ewart, who later joined Murnane in the Kimberley to research horse disease, according to Auty. “Ewart wrote that the ‘larger question’ was not whether Murnane and the police patrol had perpetrated mass murder, but ‘whether the blacks are to be allowed to render large tracts of country useless for white settlement’.” Aboriginal people’s actions made pastoralist retaliation inevitable, in Ewart’s view, as station owners must “either starve to death or leave the country”. The “solution” Ewart advocated was the removal of Aboriginal people to offshore reserves. He wrote: “We make reserves for native animals and surely we might also do the same for the black [since ‘genetic inferiority’ meant they were] bound to go.” Truth, reparation and amends: what’s next? The editors say this is a work of scholarship. A second volume is on the way. The work of making amends – repatriation, reparation, renaming – is for the university and its Indigenous consultative bodies to determine but can no longer be avoided. View image in fullscreen Ross Jones and James Waghorne. ‘The perpetrators of injustice should be named,’ the co-editors write. Photograph: Tamati Smith/The Guardian “The university’s continued commemoration of individuals discussed in this book prolongs trauma,” they write. “Correcting history by merely adding the long-suppressed details of the fatal impact of the colonial mission on tens of thousands of Aboriginal people is rightly regarded as an insufficient response.” Finding an “honourable” solution – including renaming – must involve telling the whole truth about history. “The perpetrators of injustice should be named, and their roles in historical events fully recounted,” they write. “However, merely deleting their names from buildings, rooms, courtyards and roads, and not explaining why, compounds the injustices with further acts of denial. “This kind of truth-telling is necessary ... if our community is to prevent the repetition of commemorative rituals that honour racists, thieves and body snatchers.” Two months ago Ormond College quietly changed the name of the Daniel Murnane scholarship, which had been set up in his name by his daughter, college alumna and benefactor Merrilyn Murnane Griffiths. “In line with Ormond College’s commitment to truth-telling and reconciliation, and following research undertaken by the University of Melbourne, the name of this scholarship was changed to Dr Merrilyn Murnane Veterinary Science scholarship,” a spokesperson said. Spears stolen by Cook returned to Aboriginal owners after more than 250 years – video Langton says she hopes Dhoombak Goobgoowana will form the basis for ongoing anti-racism work at the university. She would like to see this history taught in schools as truth-telling is vital everywhere. “Denying parts of our history is simply lying,” she says. “And this is why racism persists. So I do hope that as a result of this book, this kind of academic work, this research will inform our anti-racism strategies. “It’s most important that people understand where racism comes from, and it’s because of all the lies in Australian history. The lying in Australian history – the lying about Australian history – is one of the major contributors to racism.” For information and support in Australia call 13YARN on 13 92 76 for a crisis support line for Indigenous Australians; or call Lifeline on 13 11 14, Mensline on 1300 789 978 and Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636",

        "content": "Even when his father was arrested on drug-trafficking charges and threatened with the death penalty, it never crossed Payne Haas's mind to miss State of Origin. Brisbane's superstar prop was on the team bus to the Magic-Round clash against Manly two weekends ago when he heard that his father, Gregor, had been apprehended in the Philippines. For Haas, it was nothing out of the ordinary to press on through adversity, later compounded by a mid-game ankle injury in the 13-12 win. At only 24, Haas has already needed to process his mother's incarceration over her involvement in a fatal car crash, and last year he saw his younger brother Zeda facing drug charges that were later withdrawn. Stream every game of the 2024 NRL season live and ad free on the ABC listen app. The Grandstand Rugby League team brings you 100% Pure Footy. Haas's priority in tough times has always been to his two younger brothers, who live with him, and his daughter. \"It's a bit of a tricky one. Obviously everyone knows what's happened,\" said Haas, speaking about his father's situation for the first time. \"I'm just trying to look after my siblings and try and look after my family that I've got in Australia and try to make sure they're all right. Because what I'm going through, they're probably going through as well.\" Through everything, footy has always been a safe space for Haas. \"Obviously I grew up in not the best circumstances,'' he said. \"But I always use sport or anything as a little escape from everything. I'm sort of used to it now and I just come into footy, and that's footy. I don't try and bring my outside personal life into footy. \"There's lots of people who have got things worse, and I've been through worse things in my life.\" It's why missing State of Origin this year was never an option. The four-time Dally M Prop of the Year has become a walk-up starter for the Blues in recent years amid a dearth of other elite front-row options. He will partner newly minted captain Jake Trbojevic in the front row come June 5, with the Blues team picked on Sunday suggesting a game plan that will rely on winning the battle in the middle of the field. \"I want to be here,\" Haas said. \"This is what you want to do and why you play rugby league growing up — you want to play State of Origin. It never crossed my mind not playing. \"I'm just privileged and blessed that I get to do that now.\" The Broncos have supported Haas in his hour of need, with Haas singling out coach Kevin Walters, chief executive Dave Donaghy and education and welfare manager Adam Walsh as three pillars of support outside the playing group. \"There's so many people I can name at the Broncos. They've been so good for my family and I,\" he said. But come Origin I, there'll be no love lost between Haas and Brisbane teammates Pat Carrigan, Selwyn Cobbo and Reece Walsh, who are lining up for Queensland. \"When we're on the field, there's no mates,\" Haas said.",

A Look At The Challenges For Startups appeared first on Tekedia.",
        "content": "The tech industry was expected to reach 5.2 trillion USD by the end of 2021, but the number almost doubled as it faced a hike in demand for new technologies and innovations. This industry has always been in the limelight because of its love for innovation, investor enthusiasm, and a growing reliance on technology. These aspects have flourished the startup fever, bringing record highs in stock valuations. So far, it has captured a huge portion of the market spotlight. However, this period of rapid growth faces a new challenge: rising inflation. Inflation, the sustained increase in the cost of goods and services, has emerged as a major concern for the global economy. The tech industry, with its reliance on venture capital and focus on growth, might not be immune to its effects. Do you want to know about the challenges inflation poses for startups and explore whether it has the potential to burst the much-discussed tech bubble? Read on! Inflation Is A Curse For Startups Inflation acts like a hidden tax for startups, eroding the purchasing power of a startup’s resources. It squeezes their margins on one hand and potentially dampens consumer demand on the other. Want to know how it plays out? Have a closer look at the specific challenges! Inflation pushes up the prices of raw materials, components, and other resources needed for developing and producing tech products. This can significantly impact startups, particularly those with hardware or manufacturing components. Imagine a company building a new fitness tracker. Rising costs for chips and sensors could eat into their margins or force them to delay production. The talent pool in the tech industry is highly competitive. In an inflationary environment, salaries and benefits tend to rise to keep pace with the rising cost of living. This puts pressure on startups with limited resources to attract and retain top talent. Inflation doesn’t just affect production costs. It also increases everyday operational expenses like rent, utilities, and marketing. Startups, often operating on tight budgets, have less room to absorb these rising costs without impacting their bottom line. As inflation rises, central banks typically raise interest rates to curb inflation. This makes borrowing more expensive, which can be a major hurdle for startups. Startups often rely on loans and venture capital for funding, and higher interest rates can significantly increase the cost of capital. Rising inflation creates economic uncertainty. Investors, especially those risk-averse ones, may become more cautious when allocating funds to startups. They might be hesitant to invest in companies with unproven track records or those operating in markets potentially impacted by inflation. This could lead to a slowdown in venture capital funding, hindering the growth of many promising startups. When inflation erodes disposable income, consumer spending habits shift towards essentials. This can lead to a decrease in demand for non-essential tech products or services, especially those offered by startups in their early stages. Imagine a company developing a new productivity app. Consumers might prioritize necessities like groceries over subscribing to a new productivity tool during inflationary times. Even if consumers have disposable income, they become more price-sensitive in an inflationary environment. This can force startups to re-evaluate their pricing strategies and potentially lead to lower profit margins. These factors combine to create a challenging environment for startups. The next section will explore whether these challenges can lead to a full-blown tech bubble burst. Can Inflation Lead to a Tech Bubble Burst? The concern surrounding inflation is whether it can trigger a full-blown tech bubble burst, similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. While the potential for disruption exists, the current situation presents some key differences. The term “tech bubble” often conjures memories of the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, where inflated valuations of internet companies far exceeded their actual profitability. When the bubble burst in 2000, many startups collapsed, and the tech industry witnessed a significant downturn. This historical episode serves as a cautionary tale, raising concerns that rising inflation could trigger a similar scenario in the current tech boom. However, the current situation presents some key differences from the dot-com bubble: Many startups today boast stronger underlying fundamentals compared to their dot-com era counterparts. They often address real-world problems, have established user bases, and demonstrate clear paths to profitability. This suggests a stronger foundation for the current tech boom, potentially making it more resilient to inflation’s impact. Unlike the dot-com era’s focus on “get big fast” strategies, many startups today prioritize innovation and building sustainable businesses. This focus on long-term viability might make them better equipped to weather economic challenges. The current tech landscape is far more diversified than the dot-com era’s internet-centric focus. Startups operate across various sectors, from healthcare and finance to artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. This diversification could provide a buffer against inflation’s impact on any single sector. While a complete tech bubble burst may not be inevitable, inflation could still trigger a market correction. As investors become more risk-averse and factor in rising costs, valuations in the tech sector might adjust downwards. This could lead to a decline in stock prices for some overvalued startups, particularly those lacking a clear path to profitability. However, a correction doesn’t necessarily equate to a full-blown bubble burst. It might simply represent a healthier realignment of valuations with the actual growth potential of startups in a high-inflation environment. The Challenges And Opportunities For Startups The inflation comes with a few pressing concerns for startups, but it’s not an insurmountable obstacle. How can startups deal with this environment and even discover new opportunities for growth? 1 – Startups need to become more cost-conscious. This could involve renegotiating contracts with suppliers, streamlining operations, or adopting leaner business models. Utilizing technology for automation and process optimization can also lead to significant cost savings. 2 – During periods of inflation, profitability becomes paramount. Startups may need to shift their focus away from rapid user acquisition and prioritize sustainable revenue streams. This might involve adjusting pricing models, exploring new monetization strategies, or focusing on customer segments with higher purchasing power. 3 – Having a healthy cash reserve can act as a buffer against unexpected cost increases and economic downturns. Startups should prioritize building a financial cushion to weather potential storms and maintain flexibility for future investments. In a way, inflation can be a catalyst for innovation. As costs rise, startups are incentivized to find creative solutions for improving efficiency and maximizing output. Startups can leverage technology to automate tasks, optimize resource allocation, and streamline production processes. This not only reduces costs but also improves overall productivity. Startups with innovative solutions that demonstrably improve efficiency or add significant value for customers will be better positioned to attract investors and survive market fluctuations. With rising costs and tighter budgets, consumers are increasingly seeking innovative financial solutions. Startups offering budgeting tools, personal finance management platforms, or alternative payment methods can see increased demand. As businesses tighten their belts, they might be more susceptible to cyberattacks targeting cost-cutting measures that compromise security. Startups offering robust cybersecurity solutions can find a promising market in this environment. Inflationary pressures might exacerbate the trend towards remote work models. Startups offering innovative tools for monitoring markets like Immediate maximum , communication, collaboration, and remote project management could see significant growth. By adopting strategic cost-cutting measures, focusing on profitability and value creation, and staying at the forefront of innovation, startups can not only survive inflation but also potentially thrive in this challenging economic sector. Wrapping Up Inflation brings a pyramid of challenges for startups, raising operational costs, tightening access to funding, and potentially dampening consumer spending. While a complete tech bubble burst seems unlikely due to the stronger fundamentals of many startups and a more cautious investor landscape, a market correction is a possibility. However, this period of economic uncertainty can also be a catalyst for innovation and adaptation. Startups that prioritize cost-efficiency, profitability, and value creation while also exploring new opportunities in sectors like fintech and remote work solutions are well-positioned not only to weather the storm but potentially emerge stronger in a transformed tech structure.",

        "content": "British foreign minister David Cameron said on Tuesday an investigation by the Israeli army into the Rafah air strikes must be \"swift, comprehensive and transparent\", again calling for a pause in fighting. “Deeply distressing scenes following the air strikes in Rafah this weekend,” Cameron said on X, saying the “investigation must be swift, comprehensive and transparent.” “We urgently need a deal to get hostages out and aid in, with a pause in fighting to allow work towards a long-term sustainable ceasefire.” Israel pounded Rafah with airstrikes and tank fire on Tuesday, pressing its offensive in Gaza's southern city despite international condemnation of an attack that sparked a blaze in a tent camp for the displaced, killing at least 45 people. At least 16 Palestinians were killed in strikes overnight on Tuesday, officials in the enclave run by Hamas militants said. Israeli tanks pushed towards western neighborhoods in one of the worst nights of bombardment reported by residents. Reacting to Sunday night's strike and fire in a camp where thousands of families displaced from assaults elsewhere in the Gaza Strip had sought shelter, global leaders urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault. Before the latest advancement, Israeli tanks had probed around the edges of Rafah, near the crossing point from Gaza into Egypt, and entered some of its eastern districts, residents said, but have not yet entered the city in full force. Residents said Israeli tanks were stationed on and around the Zurub hilltop, a high ground overlooking western Rafah, having advanced from the area near the Egyptian border crossing where Israeli forces launched an incursion three weeks ago. They said the Tel Al-Sultan area, the scene of Sunday's deadly strike, was still being heavily bombarded. \"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,\" one resident told Reuters over a chat app. Around one million people have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday. Israel has kept up attacks despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing that the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there. Spain, Ireland and Norway will officially recognize a Palestinian state on Tuesday, despite an angry reaction from Israel, which has found itself increasingly isolated after more than seven months of conflict in Gaza. The three nations have painted their decision as a way to speed efforts to secure a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas. More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area. In Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, one of the largest of the enclave's eight historic refugee camps, Israeli forces have been engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters, residents said. On Tuesday, medics said an Israeli air strike killed and wounded several Palestinians in a house in the Falouja neighborhood. Civil emergency teams said they believed many bodies were under the rubble of buildings where they can't be reached. Around one million people have fled the Gazan city of Rafah in the past three weeks, the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) said on Tuesday. The small city on the southern edge of the Gaza Strip had been sheltering more than a million Palestinians who fled Israeli assaults on other parts of the enclave. Since early May, Israel's military has been carrying out what it says is a limited operation in Rafah to kill fighters and dismantle infrastructure used by Hamas, which runs Gaza. It has told civilians to go to an \"expanded humanitarian zone\" some 20 km (12 miles) away. Many Palestinians have complained they are vulnerable to Israeli attacks wherever they go and have been moving up and down the Gaza Strip in the past few months. UNRWA said the flight from Rafah \"happened with nowhere safe to go and amidst bombardments, lack of food and water, piles of waste and unsuitable living conditions.\" Providing assistance and protection is becoming nearly \"impossible\", the agency said. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the Spanish Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state at its Tuesday morning meeting as a European Union rift with Israel widens. Ireland and Norway were also to make official their recognition of a Palestinian state later in the day. While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so. “This is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,” said Sánchez, standing at the gates of the prime minister's palace in Madrid, during a televised speech. Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz, however, lashed out at Spain on X, saying Sánchez's government was “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes.” Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid insisting that the EU should take action against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. Norway, which is not an EU member but often aligns its foreign policy with the bloc, handed diplomatic papers to the Palestinian government over the weekend ahead of its formal recognition of a Palestinian state. At the same time, the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including leaders of the Hamas armed group. In his speech on Tuesday, Sánchez said that the recognition of a Palestinian state was “a decision that we do not adopt against anyone, least of all against Israel, a friendly people whom we respect, whom we appreciate and with whom we want to have the best possible relationship.” The Socialist leader, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza. He called for a permanent ceasefire, for stepping up humanitarian aid into Gaza and for the release of hostages that Hamas has held since the Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel's response. Sánchez said that the move was to back the beleaguered Palestinian National Authority, which lost effective political control of Gaza to Hamas. He laid out his vision for a state ruled by the Palestinian National Authority that must connect the West Bank and Gaza with East Jerusalem through a corridor. “We will not recognize changes in the 1967 border lines other than those agreed to by the parties,” Sánchez added. “Furthermore, this decision reflects our absolute rejection of Hamas, a terrorist organization who is against the two-state solution,” Sánchez said. “From the outset, Spain has strongly condemned the terrorist attacks of Oct. 7. This clear condemnation is the resounding expression of our steadfast commitment in the fight against terrorism. I would like to underline that starting tomorrow we would focus all our efforts to implement the two-state solution and make it a reality.” The Israeli army said it kicked off a series of new security measures in the northern Israeli towns after carrying out a drill simulating a ground offensive in Lebanon. Lebanon’s Hezbollah group had intensified its attacks on Israel in response to the latter’s Monday strike that targeted a hospital entrance in south Lebanon killing one person. In recent weeks, the Israeli army carried out a drill simulating a ground offensive on Lebanon. The Israeli army spokesperson said the “exercise simulated combat scenarios in the northern arena, the rapid deployment of forces on the ground, the functioning of the division and brigade headquarters and the readiness of the forces for an attack”. Israel’s announcement comes amid new strict measures imposed in Israeli settlements and northern towns. News agencies have displayed images showing cement barriers placed as roadblocks in northern Israel. An Israeli newspaper also reported that the army decided to trim down its alert units in the northern towns, a decision that drew criticisms from Israeli officers. An order was also issued to close an Israeli settlement, and entry banned even for Israeli soldiers. The new measures triggered concern among the town residents, amid mass destruction of buildings estimated by Israel’s i24 News at 930 buildings destroyed by Hezbollah strikes. On Sunday, Hezbollah heavily shelled the town of Kiryat Shmona. The town’s municipal chief was quoted as saying that over 40 percent of the town’s fleeing residents have no plans of returning back. “We expect the number to rise”, he said. Hezbollah, in a wide-scale offensive, carried out 15 military operations on Sunday against Israeli targets in response to the latters’ successive attacks targeting people on motorcycles in Lebanese border towns. An Israeli strike on Monday outside a hospital in south Lebanon killed one person at the hospital entrance. He was heading for medical tests. Fifteen other people sustained varying injuries, including seven civilians and eight health care workers at Salah Ghandour Hospital in the city of Bint Jbeil. The hospital security guard, Hassan Jouni, underwent surgery due to severe injuries. For the first time since the hostilities began in the southern Lebanon border area, the Israeli army targeted the vicinity of a hospital on Monday morning. The Israeli military has increased its efforts in recent days to apprehend individuals using cars or motorcycles on the roads, resulting in the fatalities of Hezbollah members and civilians. The Lebanese Ministry of Health condemned the brutal Israeli shelling that targeted the hospital. Hezbollah retaliated against the Israeli assault on the hospital by “targeting and destroying the newly installed spy equipment at the Miskaf Am site.” The Israeli military said that it bombed a building where Hezbollah members were located in the Yaron border area on Sunday. Additionally, the air force targeted Hezbollah members in Hula, hitting a weapons storage facility in Mays Al-Jabal and military infrastructure in Khiam. The Israeli raid on the town of Yaron led to casualties. Two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants were attacked in Baghdad over the past 48 hours, causing damage but no injuries, and Iraqi security forces arrested some suspects, the interior ministry and police sources said on Monday. Initial investigations showed that the restaurants were targeted over the perceived support of US-based brands for Israel amid the war in the Gaza Strip, police sources said. The first attack took place early on Sunday when two men on a motorcycle threw a make-shift bomb at a branch of the American fried chicken chain restaurant in eastern Baghdad's Palestine Street, causing minor damage, police sources said. On Monday, another KFC Baghdad branch and a second American-style restaurant were attacked by group of masked men who broke into the restaurants and used sticks to smash glass and destroy furniture. They fled before the arrival of security forces, police sources said. KFC did not immediately comment on the attacks. The interior ministry did not elaborate on the motives behind the attacks and said a police commander and other officers responsible for the areas where the attacks occurred had been detained and faced punitive measures. Western brands have been hit by boycotts and other forms of protest by a largely spontaneous, grassroots campaign over Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip since the deadly Hamas attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7. The actions reflect a groundswell of anger over Israel's military operation that has killed more than 35,000 people in Gaza, according to health authorities there, and caused a humanitarian crisis. The Biden administration told Israel to take every precaution to protect civilians after a military strike in Rafah killed dozens of Palestinians, as it faced calls from some fellow Democrats to halt military shipments to Israel. \"Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,\" a National Security Council spokesperson said. \"But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians. Biden has faced increasing pressure from within his own party to scale back support for Israel, even before the airstrike on Sunday night that set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze in a Rafah camp, killing 45 people. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a prominent Democratic lawmaker in the House of Representatives, on Monday called the strike \"an indefensible atrocity\", adding in a social media post that \"it is long past time for the President to live up to his word and suspend military aid.\" \"Horrific and gut wrenching images coming out of Rafah last night,\" Representative Ayanna Pressley said in a social media post. \"How much longer will the US stand by while the Israeli military slaughters and mutilates Palestinian babies?\" Representative Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American serving in Congress, called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a \"genocidal maniac\". Netanyahu on Monday said the strike was not intended to cause civilian casualties but went \"tragically wrong.\" The NSC spokesperson said the US government was \"actively engaging\" with the Israeli military and others on the ground to assess what happened. Almost half of Democratic voters disapprove of Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war, according to a recent poll from Reuters/Ipsos. Weeks of campus protests about the war have added to the pressure, and wider demands for a permanent ceasefire have put Biden's reelection campaign on the defensive. An Israeli strike targeting a motorcycle in southern Lebanon hit next to a hospital entrance Monday, killing the motorcycle driver and a hospital security guard and wounding several civilians nearby, local health officials said. It was not immediately clear who the driver was or why he was targeted in the strike in the town of Bint Jbeil. The Israeli army did not give a statement on the strike but said it had targeted other areas of southern Lebanon in response to “terrorist launches.” The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has been exchanging strikes with Israeli forces in the border area almost daily since Oct. 8, a day after the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza began. Mohammed Suleiman, director of the Salah Ghandour Hospital in Bint Jbeil, said they had initially received one person killed and nine wounded in the strike, most of whom were “civilians who were in front of the hospital, where family members and people accompanying the patients usually gather.” Hospital officials later said that a security guard who was wounded in the strike had died. The strike also caused minor damage to the hospital, an Associated Press photographer at the scene said. Hezbollah later said it had launched a barrage of dozens of missiles at Meron, Safsufa and Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel in response. Israeli strikes have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon since the war in Gaza began, most of them militants with Hezbollah and allied groups but also including more than 70 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, strikes from Lebanon have killed 15 soldiers and 10 civilians. The clashes have displaced tens of thousands on each side of the border. Israeli officials have said they may launch an offensive in Lebanon if no diplomatic solution is reached that would allow the displaced to return. The Israeli military said Monday that its reservists had in recent weeks “conducted a division-level and brigade-level exercise that simulated ground operations in Lebanon.\" Hezbollah legislator Hassan Fadlallah, who visited the site of the strike in Bint Jbeil, said that Israel “will not be able to return settlers (residents) to the north in this way.” “The only way to stop everything that is happening in the region today and on the border with Lebanon is to stop the aggression against Gaza,” he said. Western countries, in particular the US and France, have come forward with a series of proposals for a cessation of hostilities on the Lebanon-Israel border. Hezbollah has refused to enter into an agreement until a ceasefire is implemented in Gaza. Initially, the proposals stipulated that Hezbollah would move its forces several kilometers away from the border, but a French diplomatic official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing negotiations said the latest proposal has abandoned this idea as Hezbollah would not agree to it unless Israel also halted its overflights in Lebanese airspace. Instead, the new proposal would rely on a strengthened presence of the official Lebanese army and UNIFIL peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon to enforce the cessation of hostilities, with a long-term aim of negotiations for demarcation of the land border between Lebanon and Israel. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian was expected to arrive in Beirut on a diplomatic visit Tuesday. The members of the Ministerial Committee assigned by the Joint Arab-Islamic Extraordinary Summit met in Brussels on Monday with European Union Foreign Affairs Council to discuss the war on Gaza. Chaired by Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs Prince Faisal bin Farhan bin Abdullah, the committee included Qatari Prime Minister and FM Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Jordan's Deputy PM and FM Dr. Ayman Al-Safadi, and Egyptian FM Sameh Shoukry. They discussed the dangerous developments in Gaza and the Israel’s ongoing military operation that is claiming the lives of innocent civilians, including the recent “appalling targeting of the tents of displaced Palestinians near the headquarters of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA)” in Rafah. The Ministerial Committee “stressed the need for the international community to fulfill its responsibility to intervene immediately to stop the massacres committed by the Israeli forces and to stop the deepening of the unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe that the Palestinian people are experiencing.” It reiterated the importance of creating serious political conditions for the establishment of a Palestinian state according to the 1967 border with East Jerusalem as its capital, and in line with the relevant international resolutions. It expressed its rejection of “discussing the future of the Gaza Strip in isolation from the Palestinian issue.” It called for “confronting all flagrant violations committed by the Israeli forces against the Palestinian people” and stressed the importance of holding the Israel accountable for the ongoing violations in the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The European Union pledged more than 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) on Monday to support displaced Syrians, but it dismissed any notion of them being able to return home because of instability under Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Before an EU-led donor conference on the 13-year-old war, Jordan's foreign minister said that the international community was abandoning Syrian refugees as funding to support them in host countries dwindles, suggesting that ways had to be found to ease voluntary returns to Syria. The EU conference aims to keep the war on the agenda, as well as support for the millions of refugees it has created. But as the economic and social burden on neighboring countries mounts the bloc is divided and unable to find solutions, diplomats say. Refugees returning home is not yet one of them however, the bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell made clear at the start of the conference. \"While the European Union would wish that returning home could be a realistic option for all refugees, everywhere and always, we concur with the United Nations system that currently the conditions for safe, voluntary and dignified returns to Syria are not in place,\" Borrell said. \"We insist that it is the Assad regime that bears the primary responsibility for putting in place these conditions.\" Borrell said the bloc was pledging 560 million euros in 2024 and 2025 to support refugees in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan and a further 1 billion euros for Türkiye. Syria has become a forgotten crisis that nobody wants to stir, amid the Israeli war in Gaza and tensions growing between Iran and Western powers over its regional activities. Although Assad has long since reasserted control over most of Syria in a war that began with a 2011 uprising against him, more than 5 million refugees mostly in Lebanon, Türkiye and Jordan and millions more displaced internally still have little prospect of returning home. \"We're going to be sending a very clear message from Jordan as a host country that we feel that refugees are being abandoned,\" Ayman Safadi told reporters on arrival in Brussels. \"Host countries are being abandoned.\" Jordan is hosting around 1.3 million Syrians. Safadi said the issue \"can only be solved by them going back to their country. So, we need to focus more on creating conditions conducive for them to return voluntarily.\" Funding to support refugees is dropping with the likes of the World Food Program reducing its aid. Countries say hosting refugees is an increasing burden, notably in economic crisis-hit Lebanon, where the discontent has seen forced deportations. \"We expect our partners to uphold international law, including the principle of non-refoulement, and reject and condemn any forced deportations,\" Borrell said. The 8th Syria conference brings together European and Arab ministers along with key international organizations, but beyond vague promises and financial pledges there are few signs that Europe can take the lead, diplomats said. The bloc has no ties with the Assad government and Monday's talks come just ahead of the European elections on June 6-9 in which migration is a divisive issue among the EU's 27 member states. With far-right and populist parties already expected to do well, there is little appetite to step up refugee support. An upswing in migrant boat arrivals from Lebanon to Europe, with Cyprus and Italy major destinations, has prompted some EU countries to warn of a big new influx into the bloc. \"We'll continue to do everything we can. But unless we're helped, unless the international community shoulders its responsibility, there will be a decrease in services and there will be more suffering for refugees,\" Safadi said. Arab countries and organizations slammed on Monday Israel for its strikes on a center for displaced Palestinians that killed dozens near the southern city of Rafah on Sunday. The health ministry in Gaza said in a statement that the strikes \"claimed the lives of 35 martyrs and left dozens injured, most of them children and women\". The Hamas-run government media office in Gaza earlier said the attack hit a center run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees near Rafah, branding it a \"horrific massacre\". The Palestinian Authority presidency in the West Bank called it a \"heinous massacre\", accusing Israeli forces of \"deliberately targeting\" the tents of displaced people. The massacre is an act of \"defiance to all international resolutions,\" it added in a statement. Gaza's civil defense agency said Israeli strikes killed and wounded at least 50 people in the area, where it said 100,000 displaced people live. Hamas said Palestinians must \"rise up and march\" against the attack. The Israeli army said it had targeted Hamas fighters. Israel's army said its aircraft \"struck a Hamas compound in Rafah\", killing Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, both senior officials for the Palestinian armed group in the occupied West Bank. It added that it was \"aware of reports indicating that as a result of the strike and fire that was ignited, several civilians in the area were harmed. The incident is under review.\" Palestinians carry a body after an Israeli army raid on a camp at an area designated for displaced people in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, 27 May 2024. (EPA) Qatar said on Monday the latest Israeli attack on Rafah could hinder mediation efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage exchange deal, a foreign ministry statement said. Kuwait's Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the attack, saying the Israeli forces’ actions against Palestinians \"exposes their blatant war crimes and unprecedented genocide to the whole world.\" \"This calls for immediate and firm intervention by the international community to compel these forces into adhering to international legitimacy resolutions, including the International Justice Court resolution on immediately ceasing the aggression against Rafah, and protecting the Palestinian people,\" it demanded in a statement. Egypt strongly condemned the attack, saying Israeli forces \"deliberately\" targeted the displaced. The Foreign Ministry said Cairo had called on Israel \"to meet its legal commitments as an occupying power\" and respect the International Court of Justice’s call on it to immediately cease its military operations. The Jordanian Foreign Ministry condemned the \"ongoing heinous war crimes committed by the Israeli forces in Gaza,\" saying the latest attack in Rafah was a \"flagrant challenge to the ICJ and grave violation of international law and international humanitarian law.\" The Arab Parliament echoed the condemnation, warning in a statement that \"failure to hold Israel to account for its crimes and massacres against the Palestinians and failure to take any deterrent measures against it will only make it commit more killings and cause more destruction.\" The Organization of Islamic Cooperation slammed the \"heinous Israeli massacre against Palestinian civilians,\" describing it as a \"war crime, crime against humanity and state organized terrorism\" and demanding that Israel be held to account before international justice.",

        "content": "tvN’s “ The Midnight Romance in Hagwon ” has shared a new making-of video! Helmed by director Ahn Pan Seok of the hit drama “Something in the Rain,” “The Midnight Romance in Hagwon” is a new romance set against the backdrop of Daechi, a neighborhood known as the epicenter of private education in Korea due to its high concentration of hagwons (private educational institutions). In a newly released behind-the-scenes video, Jung Ryeo Won and Wi Ha Joon steal the spotlight with their flawless performance during an eating scene. Not a single line is flubbed, prompting the director to jokingly suggest giving them a whopping 30 pages of script for a single scene, confident they can pull it off effortlessly. During a valley scene, Wi Ha Joon and Kim Jong Tae demonstrate their professionalism as they meticulously plan a fall into shallow water. Despite concerns about timing, they remain composed. Wi Ha Joon, however, seems a bit jittery about executing the fall according to plan. Jung Ryeo Won lightens the mood with a quip, suggesting, “It would be hilarious if only Ha Joon fell into the water.” In the end, they flawlessly execute the scene. When filming the episode’s highlight, the kiss scene, Jung Ryeo Won and Wi Ha Joon leave no detail to chance as they rehearse every movement with precision, guided by the director. Yet, during the actual take, Wi Ha Joon hilariously fumbles the timing to grab Jung Ryeo Won’s hand. With a quick recovery, he nails the confession and kiss scene on the second try. Check out the making-of video below! “The Midnight Romance in Hagwon” airs every Saturday and Sunday at 9:20 p.m. KST. Catch up on the drama below: Watch Now",

Flight VA696 returned to Perth Airport due to a “disruptive passenger,” an airline statement said. Australian Federal Police officers were waiting for the plane and “the disruptive guest was offloaded,” Virgin said. Police said “officers arrested a man after he allegedly ran naked through the aircraft mid-flight and knocked a crew member to the floor.” “The man was transferred to hospital for assessment, where he remains,” a police statement said. It was not clear how or where on the plane the passenger removed his clothes. Police expect to order the man by summons to appear in a Perth court on June 14. What charges he will face have yet to be finalised. The airline apologised to “guests impacted,” adding the safety of passengers and crew was its top priority. Both the airline and police declined comment beyond their statements. Australian Broadcasting Corp reported that it understood nobody was injured during the incident.",

        "content": "The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Tuesday acquitted Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh and four others in the murder case of the sect’s former manager Ranjit Singh in 2002. The Sirsa-headquartered sect chief, who is also serving a 20-year jail term for raping two of his disciples, is currently lodged in Sunaria jail in Rohtak, Haryana. “The high court has acquitted him and four others in the Ranjit Singh murder case,” Dera chief’s lawyer Jitender Khurana said. He said the arguments in the case had got over earlier and the matter came up for pronouncement of verdict before the high court on Tuesday. Khurana said a division bench of Justice Sureshwar Thakur and Justice Lalit Batra pronounced the decision on the appeals filed by Ram Rahim and four others who had been convicted by a special CBI court in Panchkula, Haryana, in October 2021. The court had sentenced them to life imprisonment in the nearly 20-year-old murder case of Ranjit Singh. He had been held guilty of hatching a criminal conspiracy with his co-accused. Ranjit Singh, who was also a follower of the sect, was shot dead on July 10, 2002, at Khanpur Kolian village in Haryana’s Kurukshetra. He was allegedly murdered for his suspected role in the circulation of an anonymous letter, which narrated how women were being sexually exploited by the sect head at the Dera headquarters. According to the CBI charge sheet earlier, the Dera chief believed that Ranjit Singh was behind the circulation of the anonymous letter and hatched a conspiracy to kill him. In 2017, Ram Rahim was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for raping two disciples after which he was lodged in Rohtak’s Sunaria jail. The Dera chief and three others were also convicted in 2019 for the murder of a journalist more than 16 years ago.",

        "content": "We solemnly pay tribute to those Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines who’ve fallen in combat. They gave their last, full measure of devotion, patriotism, or a simple determination not to let their brothers down. As has been said by those better than me, including President Ronald Reagan, they gave two lives: The one they brought to the battlefield and the one they would never have the chance to live—a vocation, a wife, children, as well as however many decades God would allow to enjoy their parents, who also lost lives of family togetherness. I humbly share a searchable (by title) piece by combat veteran John A. Lucas, “Memorial Day: A Time for Recollection and Reflection, not Celebration,” posted at Bravo Blue, https://johnalucas6.substack.com/. Lucas recounts the story of a soldier: “Garney Burleson was a farm boy from North Carolina. He is not famous. You will not read about him anywhere other than here. “He was a member of the elite aero-rifle platoon of B Troop, 1/9 Cavalry, of the famed 1st Cavalry Division, also known as the ‘Bravo Blues.’ Garney was killed in action on January 28, 1971, in Binh Tuy Province, Vietnam. He was twenty.” His last minutes in combat are described; tears flow for all fallen. A lesser message is still of great importance for America’s future, free of foreign domination. Such freedom may depend on the willingness of future generations to place love of country ahead of other pastimes and beliefs, and be willing to serve America militarily: “Can We Teach Our Children to Love America?” By Rick Moran. He cites a portion of a Wall Street Journal piece by Peggy Noonan (with whom I agree here) on the insidious anti-American programming in our schools: “We live in an age—I’ll say this part quickly as we all know it—in which children are instructed in 100 different ways through 100 different portals that America is and always was a dark and scheming place, that its history is the history of pushing people around, often in an amoral quest for wealth but also because we aren’t very nice... “Ideology and idiocy imposed this view, shallowness too. It began some decades ago but has speeded up and became more extreme the past 10 years. What does this atmosphere of unlove for America do to kids? To little ones 5 and 10 but also 15—what is its impact on them?” We can only hope for corrective, patriotic instruction to replace such ambivalence, even hatred, for America and instill values of love and sacrifice.” *** The local story of Luke Mobilio—whose father, Officer David Mobilio, was murdered at the fueling station on North Main Street—graduating from Chico State was inspiring in the pride and love between mother and son, and in memory of his dad. Likewise, Luke’s determination to serve in law enforcement. The story was touching, informative. For recent members joining our community, for whom that dark episode is history, allow me to vent. The young man who murdered Officer Mobilio in a cowardly act of “ambushed” shares much with the Antifa/BLM rioters, lawless climate crazies, Occupy Wall Street, Hamas-nicks, and other leftists whose ideology is “tear it down.” He was a 2002 microcosm of the 2020 “summer of rioting and arson” after George Floyd’s death (from overdosing, not by a cop’s excessive force—fact), ginned up by anarchists, BLM fanatics and cop-hating Marxist agitators into saint-like status. Our hopes and best wishes for a long career of service for Mr. Mobilio in a profession—law enforcement—still held in high esteem by citizens of conscience. *** We had a chance to witness professionalism in the line of duty when we walked into a Jersey Mike’s sub shop in Bend, Ore., to find the manager directing us away from a disheveled, scruffy, “dazed” guy who had wandered in and attempted to enter the food prep area. Having called authorities, his crew continued serving food that met the quality pitched by actor Danny DeVito. The manager resisted getting physical with the transient; that didn’t work for several encounters I had with such people as a fast-food manager. My point here is that within minutes several officers arrived whose actions and attitudes were spot on for dealing with such situations. The “show of force” was sufficient to encourage the transient to leave without physical force. Kudos to any officer or sheriff’s deputy who can navigate the complex world of ubiquitous phone cameras, and people ready to post slanted, clipped video of otherwise reasonable actions to protect peaceful folks from harm. In my 30s and 40s, I had numerous occasions requiring (in my mind, anyway) manhandling such people to throw them out of a restaurant before they became a threat to diners. It was probably not the best way—it could have been dangerous, actually—but it was that or let them spread their garbage 10 feet in every direction. It’s best left to officers, to be honest.",

        "content": "Revealed: The simple food swaps you can make to slash your carbon footprint by 71% - including swapping chocolate cereal for porridge, and diet cola for kombucha Researchers analysed the carbon footprints of 22,000 popular food products They've revealed the simple swaps you can make to slash your emissions By Shivali Best For Mailonline Published: 10:00, 28 May 2024 | Updated: 10:00, 28 May 2024 e-mail 3 View comments From carrying a reusable water bottle to choosing clean energy, many of us try to do our bit to cut our carbon footprint. Now, a study has revealed a simple way that you could slash your footprint by a whopping 71 per cent. Researchers from The George Institute for Global Health and Imperial College London say that making simple food swaps can help to drastically reduce your emissions. And before the foodies among you begin to panic, there's good news - many of their suggested swaps are less drastic than you might imagine. 'You can switch to lower emissions products while still enjoying nutritious foods,' said Dr Allison Gaines, lead author of the study. Researchers from The George Institute for Global Health and Imperial College London say that making simple food swaps can help to drastically reduce your emissions The simple food swaps you can make to slash your carbon footprint Swap chocolate chip brioche rolls for sourdough loaf Swap chocolate cereal for porridge Swap dark chocolate for chewy mints Swap greek yogurt for coconut yogurt Swap biltong for frozen chicken tenders Swap sugar-free vanilla cola for kombucha Swap prawn seafood dip for chunky tomato salsa Swap roast chicken flavour crisps for cheese flavour whole grain bites Advertisement In the study, the team set out to understand how making small changes to your grocery list could help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 'Dietary habits need to change significantly if we are to meet global emissions targets, particularly in high-income countries like Australia, the UK, and US,' Dr Gaines said. 'But while consumers are increasingly aware of the environmental impact of the food system and willing to make more sustainable food choices, they lack reliable information to identify the more environmentally friendly options.' The team analsyed the grocery purchases from 7,000 Australian households, with a combined total of more 22,000 popular products. The products were assigned to major and minor sub-categories (such as 'bakery' and 'white bread', respectively), before their carbon emissions were calculated. The analysis revealed that meat products contributed almost half (49 per cent) of all greenhouse gas emissions, but only 11 per cent of total purchases. In contrast, fruit, vegetables, nuts and legumes represented 25 per cent of all purchases, but were responsible for just five per cent of emissions. Making switches within the same major category could lead to emission reductions of 26 per cent, according to the researchers. Making switches within the same major category could lead to emission reductions of 26 per cent, according to the researchers. However, if you really want to slash your carbon footprint, it's all about making changes within the minor category (stock image) Read More Would you try an anchovy lasagne? Scientists say swapping red meat for cheap, oily fish could save up to 750,000 lives a year globally However, if you really want to slash your carbon footprint, it's all about making changes within the minor category. 'The results of our study show the potential to significantly reduce our environmental impact by switching like-for-like products,' Dr Gaines said. 'This is also something consumers in the UK could, and would probably like, to do if we put emissions information onto product labels.' Instead of opting for Chocolate Chip Brioche Rolls, the researchers suggest buying a Sourdough Loaf, while chocolate cereals should be replaced with porridge. Dark chocolate should be subbed for chewy mints, while sweetened greek yoghurt can be replaced with coconut yoghurt. Meat lovers, meanwhile, should swap biltong for frozen chicken tenders, while seafood fans should choose sardines over rainbow trout. The researchers hope the findings will encourage shoppers to reconsider their shopping lists. Professor Bruce Neal, Executive Director at The George Institute Australia and Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at Imperial College London, said: 'There is currently no standardised framework for regulating the climate or planetary health parameters of our food supply, and voluntary measures have not been widely adopted by most countries. 'This research shows how innovative ways of approaching the problem could enable consumers to make a real impact' WHAT IS THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF SANDWICHES? The overall annual consumption of sandwiches across the UK has the same environmental impact as the use of around eight million cars a year, scientists have claimed. Researchers arrived at the figure after studying the carbon footprint of different types of sandwiches – both home-made and pre-packaged. The team from the University of Manchester calculated the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq) – a standard unit for measuring carbon footprints – for the snacks. Their calculation was based on British Sandwich Association (BSA) figures that 11.5 billion sandwiches are eaten each year in the UK. This shows the total carbon footprint (grams of CO2 per sandwich) of 24 shop-bought sandwiches.

        "content": "I’ve been dating my girlfriend, Sarah, for a year now, and she has become increasingly insecure about my friendships with my childhood buddies — both men and women. Sarah often expresses her discomfort when I plan to hang out with them, fearing that I might grow closer to someone else. Despite my reassurances of my commitment, her insecurities persist, making it challenging for me to enjoy time with my friends. This results in me going out without her knowledge and lying to her. How can I address Sarah’s concerns and help her feel more secure in our relationship while maintaining my friendships and personal space? I want to find a balanced approach that respects her feelings and my need for social connections. : You and Sarah need to talk about who you are as people and what you need in order to be fulfilled. She must understand that you are a social person and that you need such connections in your life. Explain to Sarah what makes you happy. Tell her what you do when you hang out with your friends and why that is important to you. Further, tell her what has been happening: Because you don’t want to hurt her or be bound by her insecurities, you have resorted to sneaking out. That behavior is unhealthy and a surefire way of destroying a relationship. If the two of you are to have a chance at a future together, you will need to determine what makes each of you happy and find ways to make space for that to happen. On a deeper level, you should talk to Sarah about her past. Why is she so insecure about you being with your friends? Did something happen that led her to distrust so deeply? Whatever is making her so worried needs to be addressed so that you both can move forward. : I’ve known a guy for a few months now, and he’s become a close friend. Lately, I’ve been developing feelings for him and wondering if he sees me in a romantic light or just as a friend. He and I often spend time together, grabbing coffee, going for walks or watching movies. However, I can’t shake the uncertainty about his intentions. How can I decipher whether his gestures and interactions are purely platonic, or if there’s a potential for a deeper romantic connection between us? I want to approach this situation thoughtfully. My brother said a guy will not hang out a lot for platonic reasons. For context, I’m 23, and he’s 25. Now is your moment to be brave: Ask him. Start by telling him how much you enjoy hanging out with him; you appreciate the conversations and the time that you spend together. Admit that you are growing fond of him, and you wonder where your friendship is headed. Ask him what he is hoping for in your relationship. You can also flip it and be even bolder and tell him what you are feeling. What do you want? Would you be happy opening the door to the potential for romance with him? If so, tell him. You can even say that you appreciate the bond you currently have and don’t want to ruin it, but you are curious about what would happen if you two took it further.",

        "content": "On Tuesday, RBC Capital adjusted its outlook on National Grid (LON: NG :LN) (NYSE: NGG) shares, lowering the price target to GBP11.25 from GBP12.50, yet maintaining an Outperform rating. The firm's decision comes amid considerations of the company's financial strategy and investment plans. National Grid, which operates the electricity and gas transmission network in the UK and parts of the US, has been under scrutiny regarding its balance sheet. RBC Capital acknowledges that National Grid's recent capital raise has effectively addressed these concerns. The GBP7 billion raised should be viewed within the context of the company's larger GBP60 billion investment strategy, which is notably higher than the consensus estimate of around GBP50 billion. The analyst from RBC Capital noted that despite fluctuations in interest rates, the risk associated with the timing into the RIIO-T3 regulatory period appears limited. RIIO-T3 is the upcoming regulatory framework that will set the price controls for electricity transmission for the next several years in the UK. In terms of medium-term prospects, National Grid's guidance on asset growth and earnings is considered attractive when compared to its regulated industry peers. The firm reiterates confidence in the utility company's performance, as reflected in the Outperform rating, despite the revised price target of 1,125 pence per share. The updated price target reflects a more conservative valuation, aligning with the broader economic environment and the company's financial maneuvers. National Grid's strategic investments and financial guidance continue to be a focal point for analysts monitoring the utility sector. InvestingPro Insights In light of the recent analysis by RBC Capital on National Grid (NYSE: NGG), InvestingPro data and tips provide additional context to the company's financial outlook. National Grid has demonstrated a commitment to shareholder returns, having increased its dividend for 5 consecutive years and maintained dividend payments for 29 years. This consistency is a positive signal for investors looking for stable income, especially as the stock currently trades near its 52-week low, potentially offering an attractive entry point. From a valuation perspective, National Grid's adjusted P/E ratio stands at 14.9, with a more favorable forward P/E based on the last twelve months as of Q4 2024 at 11.23. Despite recent revenue contraction, the company has maintained a strong operating income margin of 20.17% over the same period. Additionally, the dividend yield as of the most recent data is appealing at 3.89%, supported by a notable dividend growth of 15.6% in the last twelve months.

        "description": "Switching food and drink purchases to very similar but more environmentally friendly alternatives could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from household groceries by more than a quarter (26%), according to a new Australian study from The George Institute for Global Health and Imperial College London published today in Nature Food.",
        "content": "May 28, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication trusted source proofread by George Institute for Global Health Switching food and drink purchases to very similar but more environmentally friendly alternatives could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from household groceries by more than a quarter (26%), according to a new Australian study from The George Institute for Global Health and Imperial College London published today in Nature Food . Making bigger changes—like swapping a frozen meat lasagna for the vegetarian option—could push the reduction to as much as 71%. To make this happen will require on-pack labeling of greenhouse gas emissions for every packaged food product so that consumers can make informed choices. This is the most detailed analysis ever conducted on the environmental impacts of a country's food purchasing behavior, involving comprehensive data on greenhouse gas emissions and sales for tens of thousands of supermarket products, typical of the Western diet of many countries globally. Lead author and epidemiologist Dr. Allison Gaines, who conducted the analysis for The George Institute and Imperial College London, said, \"Dietary habits need to change significantly if we are to meet global emissions targets, particularly in high-income countries like Australia, the UK, and US. \"But while consumers are increasingly aware of the environmental impact of the food system and willing to make more sustainable food choices, they lack reliable information to identify the more environmentally friendly options.\" Researchers calculated the projected emissions of annual grocery purchases from 7,000 Australian households using information on ingredients, weights and production life cycles in The George Institute's FoodSwitch database and global environmental impact datasets. More than 22,000 products were assigned to major, minor and sub-categories of foods (e.g. \"bread and bakery,\" \"bread\" and \"white bread,\" respectively) to quantify emissions saved by switching both within and between groups. Making switches within the same sub-categories of foods could lead to emission reductions of 26% in Australia, equivalent to taking over 1.9 million cars off the road. Switches within minor categories of foods could lead to even bigger emission reductions of 71%. \"The results of our study show the potential to significantly reduce our environmental impact by switching like-for-like products. This is also something consumers in the UK could, and would probably like, to do if we put emissions information onto product labels,\" said Dr. Gaines. Dr. Gaines added that the switches would not compromise food healthiness overall. \"We showed that you can switch to lower emissions products while still enjoying nutritious foods. In fact, we found it would lead to a slight reduction in the proportion of ultra-processed foods purchased, which is a positive outcome because they're generally less healthy,\" she said. The purchase analysis also showed that meat products contributed almost half (49%) of all greenhouse gas emissions, but only 11% of total purchases. Conversely, fruit, vegetables, nuts and legumes represented one quarter (25%) of all purchases, but were responsible for just 5% of emissions. It is estimated that around one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to the food and agriculture sector , and the combined health and environmental costs of the global food system are estimated to be 10–14 trillion USD per year. More than 12 million deaths per year could be prevented if the system transitioned to deliver healthy, low-emission diets. Prof Bruce Neal, Executive Director at The George Institute Australia and Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at Imperial College London, said that as a global community, we are taking too long to improve the sustainability of the food system, endangering the prospect of a net-zero future. \"There is currently no standardized framework for regulating the climate or planetary health parameters of our food supply, and voluntary measures have not been widely adopted by most countries. This research shows how innovative ways of approaching the problem could enable consumers to make a real impact,\" he said. \"With this in mind, we have developed a free app called ecoSwitch, currently available in Australia, which is based on this research. Shoppers can use their device to scan a product barcode and check its 'Planetary Health Rating,' a measure of its emissions shown as a score between half a star (high emissions) to five stars (low emissions).\" The George Institute plans to extend the ecoSwitch algorithm to integrate other environmental indicators such as land and water use, and biodiversity, and to introduce the tool to other countries. \"While ecoSwitch is a much-needed first step in providing environmental transparency for grocery shoppers, the vision is for mandatory display of a single, standardized sustainability rating system on all supermarket products,\" concluded Prof Neal.

        "description": "Atropos Health just raised a $33 million Series B led by Valtruis to help doctors and researchers analyze real-world evidence with generative AI.",
        "content": "Pulling and analyzing existing medical data, with traditional methods, can take weeks or months for researchers to complete. A new generative AI tool can create those studies in minutes. Atropos Health, which makes tech to transform clinical data into real-world evidence, is riding the AI innovation wave to \"fill evidence gaps\" in healthcare — in particular, to bring information to clinicians on how to treat a patient when literature on their condition doesn't exist. \"LLMs are becoming very good at summarizing literature,\" said Brigham Hyde, CEO and cofounder of Atropos Health. \"But what happens if there's no study for the LLM to reference? That's where we operate.\" The startup just raised $33 million in Series B funding to power its latest tech. Valtruis led the round, with participation from Cencora Ventures, McKesson Ventures, Merck GHI Fund, and existing investors, including billionaire Jim Breyer's Breyer Capital, Laurene Powell Jobs' Emerson Collective, and Presidio Ventures. Atropos, founded in 2019, was spun out of technology developed at Stanford University by two of Atropos' cofounders, Nigam Shah and Saurabh Gombar. That tech was part of the \" Green Button \" initiative, funded by the National Institutes of Health, which sought to use mass amounts of clinical data from electronic health records to give doctors a second opinion about a patient's condition at the point of care. \"The key was speed,\" Hyde said. \"If you can't do it within a day, the patient's gone, and it doesn't help.\" That directive informed Atropos' development of ChatRWD, which Atropos Health launched in beta form in October to 75 customers. Right now, Hyde said, ChatRWD can generate observational studies within three minutes max. ChatRWD removes the human component of Green Button, a consultation service still offered by Atropos. With Green Button, Atropos produces observational studies in response to a user's questions and reviews them within 48 hours. Atropos launched Geneva OS alongside the bot, a data platform that connects its applications, including its evidence network, which draws on hundreds of millions of de-identified medical records. That network can help doctors access other health systems' data through Atropos' partnerships to answer clinical queries when the data from their own electronic health records isn't sufficient. Atropos has \"dozens\" of customers among health systems and life sciences, Hyde said, including Johnson & Johnson's Janssen . Funding for generative AI in healthcare is surging, with numerous startups landing big rounds for the tech this year — from clinical documentation startups like Abridge, which grabbed a $150 million Series C in February, to generative AI staffing solutions like Hippocratic AI, which landed a $53 million Series A in March. As investor interest swells, Atropos faces some big competitors, most notably startup Tempus AI, which filed for a $100 million IPO in May and also has a generative AI tool that produces insights from its large clinical and molecular data library. Atropos says it's the first generative AI tool to create publication-grade studies from clinical data in minutes. Atropos' $33 million Series B funding follows Atropos' $14 million Series A in August 2022, bringing the company's total funding to $54 million. The Series B funding will power Atropos' continued development and rollout of ChatRWD, Hyde said. He said Atropos plans to publish the results of ChatRWD's beta in June, and hopes to release the tool to all customers later this summer after publication. Atropos also wants to land more partnerships with pharma companies and expand further into specialty care and oncology, as well as value-based care, Hyde said. The company announced a partnership with value-based care platform Arcadia in January.",

Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication trusted source proofread by Nagoya University Optical analysis and machine learning techniques can now readily detect microplastics in marine and freshwater environments using inexpensive porous metal substrates. Details of the method, developed by researchers at Nagoya University with collaborators at the National Institute for Materials Sciences in Japan and others, are published in the journal Nature Communications . Detecting and identifying microplastics in water samples is essential for environmental monitoring but is challenging due in part to the structural similarity of microplastics with natural organic compounds derived from biofilms, algae, and decaying organic matter. Existing detection methods generally require complex separation techniques that are time-consuming and costly. \"Our new method can simultaneously separate and measure the abundance of six key types of microplastics—polystyrene, polyethylene, polymethylmethacrylate, polytetrafluoroethylene, nylon and polyethylene terephthalate,\" says Dr. Olga Guselnikova of the National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS). The system uses a porous metal foam to capture microplastics from solution and detect them optically using a process called surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). \"The SERS data obtained is highly complex,\" explains Dr. Joel Henzie of NIMS, \"but it contains discernible patterns that can be interpreted using modern machine learning techniques.\" To analyze the data, the team created a neural network computer algorithm called SpecATNet. This algorithm learns how to interpret the patterns in the optical measurements to identify the target microplastics more quickly and with higher accuracy than traditional methods. \"Our procedure holds immense potential for monitoring microplastics in samples obtained directly from the environment, with no pretreatment required, while being unaffected by possible contaminants that could interfere with other methods,\" says Professor Yusuke Yamauchi of Nagoya University. The researchers hope their innovation will greatly assist society in evaluating the significance of microplastic pollution on public health and the health of all organisms in marine and freshwater environments. By creating inexpensive microplastic sensors and open-source algorithms to interpret data, they hope to enable the rapid detection of microplastics, even in resource-limited labs. Currently, materials required for the new system bring cost savings of 90% to 95% compared to commercially available alternatives. The group plans to drive the cost of these sensors down even further and make the methods simple to replicate without the need for expensive facilities. In addition, the researchers hope to expand the capability of the SpecATNet neural network to detect a broader range of microplastics and even accept different kinds of spectroscopic data in addition to SERS data.

        "description": "Internal Amazon documents reveal slow adoption of its in-house AI chips and show why AWS customers still want Nvidia GPUs.",
        "content": "Amazon is struggling to compete with Nvidia 's dominant AI chips, with low usage, \"compatibility gaps,\" and project-migration issues putting millions of dollars in cloud revenue at risk, according to confidential internal documents and people familiar with the situation. It's another sign of how far behind the cloud giant is in the generative AI race. This also shows how hard it will be for tech companies including Microsoft, OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Amazon to break Nvidia's grip on this huge and important market. Bernstein Research's veteran chip analyst Stacy Rasgon said every major tech company wants a piece of Nvidia's business, but no one has been able to make a mark yet. \"I'm not aware of anyone using AWS chips in any sort of large volumes,\" Rasgon told Business Insider. Amazon Web Services is the leading cloud company, renting access to computing power and storage over the internet. Part of its success, especially its profitability, is based on designing its own data center chips, rather than paying Intel for these pricy components. In the new generative AI era, Amazon is trying to pull this off again by making its own AI chips, known as Trainium and Inferentia. This time, the idea is to avoid paying for expensive Nvidia GPUs , while still providing cloud customers with powerful AI services. Amazon is at least four years into this effort, and so far, Nvidia is proving a harder nut to crack. Nvidia spent more than a decade building a platform called CUDA that makes it easier for developers to use its GPUs. The industry has gotten used to this. Amazon now has to somehow unwind all those habits and complex technical interrelationships. Back when Amazon took on Intel's chips in the first cloud boom, AWS was the pioneer creating the platform that established standards and processes. This time, it's Nvidia that has the beachhead. If Amazon can't breach this in a significant way, it may be stuck paying Nvidia, and AWS profitability could suffer. The enormity of this challenge is revealed in the internal Amazon documents obtained by BI and the people familiar with the company's AI chip efforts. These sources asked not to be identified discussing sensitive private matters. Last year, the adoption rate of Trainium chips among AWS's largest customers was just 0.5% of Nvidia's GPUs, according to one of the internal documents. This assessment, which measures usage levels of different AI chips through AWS's cloud service, was prepared in April 2024. Inferentia, another AWS chip designed for a type of AI task known as inference, was only slightly better, at 2.7% of the Nvidia usage rate. The internal document said large cloud customers have faced \"challenges adopting\" AWS's custom AI chips, in part due to the strong appeal of Nvidia's CUDA platform. \"Early attempts from customers have exposed friction points and stifled adoption,\" the document explained. This contradicts the more upbeat outlook Amazon executives have shared about AWS's AI chip efforts. In an April earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy said demand for AWS's custom silicon was \"quite high,\" and his annual shareholder letter this year name-checked a number of early customers, such as Snap, Airbnb, and Anthropic. Even the Anthropic customer example has a big asterisk next to it. Amazon invested about $4 billion in this AI startup, and part of that deal requires Anthropic to use AWS's in-house AI chips. Amazon's chip business started in earnest when it acquired startup Annapurna Labs in 2015 for roughly $350 million. This helped the tech giant design its own chips. It now offers Arm-based Graviton CPUs for most non-AI computing tasks. Inferentia debuted in 2018 and Trainium first came out in 2020 . Other tech giants, including Google and Microsoft, are also designing custom AI chips. At the same time, the 3 major cloud firms, AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, are some of the largest Nvidia customers, as they sell access to those GPUs through their own cloud services. The in-house AI chip efforts have yet to make a major dent in Nvidia's grip on the market. On Wednesday, Nvidia reported another blowout quarter, more than tripling revenue from a year ago. The chipmaker is valued at about $2.5 trillion. That's at least $500 billion more than Amazon. Nvidia now accounts for roughly 80% of the AI chip market, according to research firm Omdia. An AWS spokesperson said there's \"growing customer excitement\" over the latest Trainium chip, which is being used by Anthropic and Databricks to train AI models. AWS's AI chips are still relatively new, so Amazon measures their success in terms of their overall usage and positive customer feedback, both of which \"are growing well,\" rather than their share of workloads, the spokesperson added. The sheer amount of GPU capacity AWS has built up over the past decade contributes to \"very large usage\" of Nvidia chips, according to the spokesperson. \"We're encouraged by the progress we're making with our custom AI chips. Building great hardware is a long term investment, and one where we have experience being persistent and successful,\" they said in a statement. Internally at Amazon, Nvidia's CUDA platform is repeatedly cited as the biggest roadblock for the AI chip initiative. Launched in 2006, CUDA is an ecosystem of developer tools, AI libraries, and programming languages that make it easier to use Nvidia's GPUs for AI projects. CUDA's head start has given Nvidia an incredibly sticky platform, which many consider to be the secret sauce behind the company's success . Amazon expects only modest adoption of its AI chips unless its own software platform, AWS Neuron, can achieve \"improved parity with CUDA capabilities,\" one of the internal documents said. Neuron is designed to help developers more easily build on top of AWS's AI chips, however, the current setup \"prevents migration from NVIDIA CUDA,\" the document added. Related stories Meta, Netflix, and other companies have asked for AWS Neuron to start supporting Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), a type of data-training algorithm for GPUs. Without that, these companies won't \"even consider\" using Trainium chips for their AI training needs, according to this internal Amazon document. Snowflake , a leading data cloud provider, is one of the companies that chose Nvidia GPUs over Amazon's AI chips when training their own large language model called Arctic . That's even though Snowflake is a major AWS cloud customer. Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy told BI that familiarity with CUDA makes it hard to transition to a different GPU, especially when doing so could risk dealing with unexpected outcomes. Training AI models is expensive and time-consuming, so any hiccups can create costly delays. Picking what you already know — CUDA in this case — is a no-brainer at the moment for many AI developers. The cost efficiency and advanced performance of Nvidia GPUs are possibly \"years\" ahead of the competition, Ramaswamy said. \"We trained Arctic on Amazon EC2 P5 instances to use Nvidia silicon because we had architected it on CUDA,\" he told BI. (EC2 P5 gives AWS customers cloud access to Nvidia H100 GPUs). Amazon's spokesperson told BI that AWS is providing cloud customers \"the choice and flexibility to use what works best for them,\" rather than forcing them to switch. Nvidia's early investment in CUDA makes it an \"essential tool\" to develop with GPUs, but it's \"uniquely focused on Nvidia's hardware,\" the Amazon spokesperson added. AWS's goal with Neuron is not necessarily to build parity with CUDA, the spokesperson added. AWS can still generate revenue when customers use its cloud services for AI tasks — even if they choose the Nvidia GPU options, rather than Trainium and Inferentia. It's just that this might be less profitable for AWS. Explosive demand for Nvidia chips is also causing a GPU shortage at Amazon, according to one of the internal documents and the people familiar with the matter. An obvious response to this would be to have cloud customers use Amazon's own AI chips instead. However, some of the largest AWS customers have not been willing to use these homegrown alternatives, the documents stated. Inferentia chips fall behind the performance and cost efficiencies of Nvidia GPUs, some customers have told Amazon, and their performance issues have been escalated internally, according to this document. The failure to replace customer demand for Nvidia GPU with AWS's own offerings have resulted in delayed services and has put millions of dollars in potential revenue at risk, the document warned. AWS discussed splitting workloads across different regions and setting up more flexible and higher-priced blocks of Nvidia GPU capacity to alleviate the shortage issue, according to this document. Even some internal Amazon AI projects rely on Nvidia GPUs, rather than AWS's homegrown chips. Earlier this year, Amazon's retail team used a cluster of Nvidia GPUs, including V100s, A10s, and A100s, to build a model for a new AI image creation tool, another internal document showed. There was no mention of AWS chips. In January, James Hamilton , an Amazon SVP and distinguished engineer, gave a presentation on machine learning and said one of his projects used 13,760 Nvidia A100 GPUs. It's unclear how well AWS AI chips are doing financially since Amazon doesn't break out specific cloud segment sales. But in April, Jassy disclosed that its array of AI products are now on pace to generate \"multi-billion\" dollars in revenue this year. That's important for AWS, as its growth rate has stagnated in recent years, though it bounced back in recent quarters. Amazon is following a sales strategy of making a variety of AI chips available through its cloud service. According to an internal sales guideline seen by BI, Amazon sales reps are encouraged to mention access to both high-end Nvidia GPUs and more affordable AWS chips when selling AI compute services. One person familiar with the situation told BI that Amazon sees a big enough opportunity in the lower end market, even if that means ceding top-of-line customers to Nvidia for now. AI chip market is forecast to more than double to $140 billion by 2027, according to research firm Gartner. To get a larger share of the market, Amazon wants to work more closely with the open-source community, according to one of the internal documents obtained by BI. For example, AWS's AI chips still have \"compatibility gaps\" in certain open-source frameworks, making Nvidia GPUs a more popular option. By embracing open-source technologies, AWS can build a \"differentiated experience,\" it added. As part of this effort, Amazon is prioritizing support for open-source models like Llama and Stable Diffusion, one of the people said. Amazon's spokesperson said AWS has partnered with Hugging Face, a hub for AI models, and was a founding member of an open-source machine learning initiative called OpenXLA to make it easier for the open-source community to take advantage of AWS AI chips. Despite Amazon's AI chip struggles, the effort seems to have caught the attention of Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang . During an interview earlier this year, Huang was asked about Nvidia's competitive landscape. \"Not only do we have competition from competitors, we have competition from our customers,\" Huang said, referring to cloud giants such as AWS that sell access to both Nvidia GPUs and their own chips. \"And I'm the only competitor to a customer fully knowing they are about to design a chip to replace ours.\" Do you work at Amazon?

        "content": "May 28, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication trusted source proofread by Northumbria University Scientists have come a step closer to identifying the mysterious origins of the \"slow\" solar wind, using data collected during the Solar Orbiter spacecraft's first close journey to the sun. Solar wind, which can travel at hundreds of kilometers per second, has fascinated scientists for years, and new research published in Nature Astronomy , is finally shedding light on how it forms. Solar wind describes the continuous outflow of charged plasma particles from the sun into space—with wind traveling at over 500km per second known as 'fast' and under 500km per second described as \"slow.\" When this wind hits the Earth's atmosphere it can result in the stunning aurora we know as the Northern Lights. But when larger quantities of plasma are released, in the form of a coronal mass ejection, it can also be hazardous, causing significant damage to satellites and communications systems. Despite decades of observations, the sources and mechanisms that release, accelerate and transport solar wind plasma away from the sun and into our solar system are not well understood—particularly the slow solar wind. In 2020, the European Space Agency (ESA), with support from NASA, launched the Solar Orbiter mission. As well as capturing the closest and most detailed images of the sun ever taken, one of the mission's main aims is to measure and link the solar wind back to its area of origin on the sun's surface. Described as \"the most complex scientific laboratory ever to have been sent to the sun,\" there are ten different scientific instruments onboard Solar Orbiter—some in situ to collect and analyze samples of the solar wind as it passes the spacecraft, and other remote sensing instruments designed to capture high quality images of activity at the sun's surface. By combining photographic and instrumental data, scientists have for the first time been able to identify more clearly where the slow solar wind originates. This has helped them to establish how it is able to leave the sun and begin its journey into the heliosphere—the giant bubble around the sun and its planets which protect our solar system from interstellar radiation. Dr. Steph Yardley of Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, led the research and explains, \"The variability of solar wind streams measured in situ at a spacecraft close to the sun provide us with a lot of information on their sources, and although past studies have traced the origins of the solar wind, this was done much closer to Earth, by which time this variability is lost. \"Because Solar Orbiter travels so close to the sun, we can capture the complex nature of the solar wind to get a much clearer picture of its origins and how this complexity is driven by the changes in different source regions.\" The difference between the speed of the fast and slow solar wind is thought to be due to the different areas of the sun's corona, the outermost layer of its atmosphere, that they originate from. The open corona refers to regions where magnetic field lines anchor to the sun at only one end, and stretch out into space on the other, creating a highway for solar material to escape into space. These areas are cooler and are believed to be the source of the fast solar wind. Meanwhile, the closed corona refers to regions of the sun where its magnetic field lines are closed—meaning they are connected to the solar surface at both ends. These can be seen as large bright loops that form over magnetically active regions. Occasionally these closed magnetic loops will break, providing a brief opportunity for solar material to escape, in the same way it does through open magnetic field lines, before reconnecting and forming a closed loop once again. This generally takes place in areas where the open and closed corona meet. One of the aims of Solar Orbiter is to test a theory that the slow solar wind originates from the closed corona and is able to escape into space through this process of magnetic field lines breaking and reconnecting. One way the scientific team were able to test this theory was by measuring the \"composition\" or make up of solar wind streams. The combination of heavy ions contained in solar material differs depending on where it has originated from; the hotter, closed versus the cooler, open corona. Using the instruments onboard Solar Orbiter, the team were able to analyze the activity taking place on the surface of the sun and then match this with the solar wind streams collected by the spacecraft. Using the images of the sun's surface captured by Solar Orbiter they were able to pinpoint that the slow wind streams had come from an area where the open and closed corona met, proving the theory that the slow wind is able to escape from closed magnetic field lines through the process of breaking and reconnection. As Dr. Yardley, of Northumbria University's Solar and Space Physics research group, explains, \"The varying composition of the solar wind measured at Solar Orbiter was consistent with the change in composition across the sources in the corona. \"The changes in composition of the heavy ions along with the electrons provide strong evidence that not only is the variability driven by the different source regions, but it is also due to reconnection processes occurring between the closed and open loops in the corona.\" The ESA Solar Orbiter mission is an international collaboration, with scientists and institutions from around the world working together, contributing specialist skills and equipment. Daniel Müller, ESA Project Scientist for Solar Orbiter, said, \"From the beginning, a central goal of the Solar Orbiter mission has been to link dynamic events on the sun to their impact on the surrounding plasma bubble of the heliosphere. \"To achieve this, we need to combine remote observations of the sun with in-situ measurements of the solar wind as it flows past the spacecraft. I am immensely proud of the entire team for making these complex measurements successfully. \"This result confirms that Solar Orbiter is able to make robust connections between the solar wind and its source regions on the solar surface. This was a key objective of the mission and opens the way for us to study the solar wind's origin in unprecedented detail.\" Among the instruments onboard Solar Orbiter is the Heavy Ion Sensor (HIS), developed in part by researchers and engineers from the University of Michigan's Space Physics Research Laboratory in the department of Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering. The sensor was designed to measure heavy ions in the solar wind, which can be used to determine where the solar wind came from. \"Each region of the sun can have a unique combination of heavy ions, which determines the chemical composition of a stream of solar wind. \"Because the chemical composition of the solar wind remains constant as it travels out into the solar system, we can use these ions as a fingerprint to determine the origin of a specific stream of the solar wind in the lower part of the sun's atmosphere,\" said Susan Lepri, a professor of climate and space sciences and engineering at the University of Michigan and the deputy principal investigator of the Heavy Ion Sensor. The electrons in the solar wind are measured by an Electron Analyser System (EAS), developed by UCL's Mullard Space Science Laboratory, where Dr. Yardley is an Honorary Fellow. Professor Christopher Owen, of UCL, said, \"The instrument teams spent more than a decade designing, building and preparing their sensors for launch, as well as planning how best to operate them in a coordinated way. So it is highly gratifying to now see the data being put together to reveal which regions of the sun are driving the slow solar wind and its variability.\" The Proton-Alpha Sensor (PAS), which measures wind speed, has been designed and developed by Paul Sabatier University's Institut de Recherche en Astrophysique et Planétologie in Toulouse, France. Together, these instruments make up the Solar Wind Analyser sensor suite on board Solar Orbiter, for which UCL's Professor Owen is principal investigator. Speaking about future research plans, Dr. Yardley said, \"So far, we have only analyzed Solar Orbiter data in this way for this particular interval. It will be very interesting to look at other cases using Solar Orbiter and to also make a comparison to datasets from other close-in missions such as NASA's Parker Solar Probe.\" More information: Multi-source connectivity as the driver of solar wind variability in the heliosphere, Nature Astronomy (2024).

        "description": "Inspired by K-pop and TikTok stars, floppy-haired fellows are flocking to the salon for an old-school perm.",
        "content": "Dillon Latham got a perm when he was 15 because he lost a bet. “I posted a TikTok and said, ‘If this gets 500,000 likes, I’ll get a perm.’ Just completely randomly,” said Latham, now 19 and a college student with a TikTok following of over 1.5 million. “I had completely straight .” The video blew up, and Latham found himself sitting in the chair at a local salon as a stylist who had “done a lot of old ladies” put rollers in and applied perm lotion. “I was nervous it would ruin my hair but it ended up turning out so much better than I thought,” said Latham. “The first thing I thought was, ‘Finally, I don’t have the Justin Bieber hair.’” TikTok star Dillon Latham got a perm at 15 after he lost a bet. That was a temporary perm that washed out after a day, which earned him the ire of his followers. “Everyone got mad when I did that, so a week later I actually did go and do it.” The reaction was “really good,” but he didn’t fall for the style until the perm grew out, and he was reminded how straight his natural texture was. “When I got it the second time, that’s when it really became the Dillon Latham Perm,” he said. That’s the TikTok trend he inspired that saw a multitude of floppy-haired take the perm plunge. “At this point, anytime somebody comes up to me, a lot of times they have the perm.” At first, getting a perm as a teenage boy in Virginia had its challenges. “When I first got it, a lot of people in my school were dissing it,” said Latham. “It definitely sucked a little bit, but I got over it.” It helped that he was getting “good reactions” from girls to his new hair. “I was like, if I’m getting bad reactions from guys and not the other way around, it probably does look good. A ton of people I know have got perms [since]. People will always hate on something that’s unpopular, but when it becomes popular, they’ll jump on the bandwagon.” Riding this wave, Latham launched his own brand, Clean Cut Cosmetics, which he said “did over one million in sales in less than a year.” TikTok star Dillon Latham helped drive the perm trend. Whether you’re walking the halls of a high school, mall or hockey arena in Southern Ontario, you’ll see permed teenage boys in droves. Just ask Sharon Lui, a York Region-based mother of a teenager, Jaymin, who recently grew out his hair in preparation for a perm. “My son is very influenced by that K-pop look,” said Lui, referencing the tousled locks of South Korean pop stars such as Jungkook of BTS and Chanyeol of Exo. “He’s 18, and I’ve noticed he’s started wanting to take care of his hair more. He went and bought a hair dryer to take to university.” South Korean K-pop band BTS members, from left, V, SUGA, JIN, Jung Kook, RM, Jimin, and j-hope pictured in 2021. She wasn’t surprised when he approached her a few months ago and said he wanted to save up to have his hair permed. “There’s something about fluffy hair with these kids,” she said. “They love the fluffy hair, and they know that they can’t get it on their own, no matter how much hair product they use.” As a parent who had her own tangle with perming lotion in her youth, Lui said it’s fun to watch this generation experiment with their hair. And she’s observed that the idea of getting a perm is normalized within her son’s peer group. “His friends would not even blink an eye if he did this,” she said. “I think the girls like it, too. It’s not frowned upon as it would have been 20 or 30 years ago. Masculinity is different now.” Ni-Ki of K-pop band Enhypen, April 29, 2024. Hairstylist Jason Lee has seen an increase in perms at his salon in Toronto’s Yonge and Eglinton area, including among women. He traces the boom to about two years ago. “All of a sudden, every 11-to-17-year-old boy with straight hair was getting a perm,” he said. “It’s like a uniform for them now. You’ll see 10 of them at Canada’s Wonderland, and you can’t tell who’s who from the back.” It is, he said, “this era’s frosted tips.” Hairstylist Jason Lee tried out the perm look last year. The look is also associated with a specific cut called the broccoli haircut, which mimics the silhouette of a head of broccoli—curly on top with short sides. (It’s worth noting that this term has also occasionally been used disparagingly to describe the natural texture of Black hair; beauty “trends” can often be culturally complex and sensitive.) Lee thinks the perm took off in K-pop because it was used to add texture to the natural straightness of some Asian hair types. He tried out a perm himself last year. “I actually really liked it. I’m a bit older, and on me,” he said. “Every one of my clients who is a mom was like, ‘You have the exact haircut that my kid is dying for.’” They started bringing their sons in. “It was funny because we hadn’t been doing perms in so long that we had to brush up on our skills,” said Lee. “Shockingly, it’s exactly the same process as it was back in the ’80s and ’90s — the same companies are creating the same perm solutions, it’s the same technique, it still sort of smells. It’s very nostalgic for me.” There are home perm kits available but technique matters, Lee said, otherwise you risk damaging hair, especially since it only lasts two to three months and then you need to repeat the process. Ultimately, Lee found that the permed look is so specific to the late Gen Z and early Gen Alpha cohort that he felt odd sporting it as an adult. “I would walk down the street and it would be me and a bunch of high school kids,” he said. “I was like, I need to go polar opposite. I shaved my head.”",

        "content": "Give me a decision to make and I’ll be happy with that choice for about five seconds before a plethora of arguments against my instinct will take over. I’m a world-class debater – but only against myself. This reflex has haunted me my whole life, applying to anything from going for a job as a cinema usher back in the ’90s (“You’ll get a spoiler every time the audience comes out of a screening”), to buying new shoes (“They won’t go with 90 per cent of your wardrobe”) or deciding to message a friend and catch up (“They’ll probably be busy”). Sometimes small decisions can be just as paralysing as big ones. Credit: iStock Even choosing something from a cafe menu can be fraught. But why do I do this? Why don’t I end up buying the shoes, making that coffee date or trying the chicken burger? Well, experts have some ideas. Protection mode is on At a very basic level, talking ourselves out of decisions is all thanks to our brains ging into survival mode. “Our brains are wired to scan for danger and to problem-solve,” says Dr Christine Raab, a Melbourne-based clinical psychologist. “Having made a decision, your brain is doing what it’s designed to do, which is to safety check. It’s asking: is this actually going to be OK?” Decisions often push us outside our comfort zone, so our in-built desire to stay within the pack is triggered. “We have a tendency to want a sense of belonging and attachment to other people,” Raab says, whether that means staying in a job, certain suburb or relationship.",

        "description": "Their new podcast \"Hello and Welcome\" launches Tuesday on The Nation Network.",
        "content": "Outside the House of Gourmet restaurant in Toronto’s bustling Chinatown on a Friday afternoon, longtime friends Will Lou and were engaged in a casual conversation that inevitably veered toward . “What should be?” Wong wondered about Toronto’s WNBA expansion franchise, before quickly trying to answer. “Huskies? Do you think they would like that?” “That’s interesting. I don’t really know,” Lou offered, as they put aside backpacks and totes to pose for pictures next to one of many colourful murals in the downtown neighbourhood. Basketball has been a uniting force between the two writers/podcasters and the Canadian community for years. Now, after a short hiatus, the dynamic duo is making a comeback. Their new podcast — “Hello and Welcome” — launches Tuesday on , a sports digital platform focused on hockey, soccer and now basketball. They’ll start with three episodes per week, then ramp up to daily coverage of the NBA next season, including pre- and post-game analysis of all 82 games. The show also plans to feature exclusive interviews with players and coaches, watch-alongs and other special events. In an exclusive interview with the Star, Lou and Wong said they are excited to be back doing what they love. “We found over time that the listeners really connected with us, and just wanted to hear us and follow our journey and how we cover the team,” said Wong, who co-hosted with Lou on Sportsnet for three years. It grew to become Canada’s most streamed basketball podcast. “ ‘Hello and Welcome’ is meant to add a welcoming tone to what kind of show and community we want to build. For me, a podcast name has to be easy, sound good and have a meaning to it, and I think this checks all the boxes.” Lou and Wong said they had always wanted to have exclusive ownership of their basketball content. This partnership does that. “The analogy I like to tell people is: ‘I used to rent and now I own’ — which is also something very rare in Toronto,” said Lou. “When you get that chance to own, all of a sudden you take on these responsibilities. This is our show now.” The seasoned writers also have diversity in mind. “If we’re going to be realistic about it, when you look across the (sports media) industry there’s very little diversity,” said Lou, who is of Chinese descent, while Wong is from Hong Kong. “It’s primarily male and primarily white, and that’s not reflective of the Toronto that we all live in and experience. “It’s a big part of why we like building community around the show, whether that’s introducing people to different restaurants or different ways of living and different things to do in Toronto. That’s always something we take so much pride in.” “Hello and Welcome” lead producer Jerome Cheng previously worked on the Athletic’s “No Dunks” pod, and was a creative producer with both the Raptors and NBA TV Canada. The summer will be busy, including coverage of NBA Summer League in Las Vegas and Canada’s exhibition games (men and women) against the United States ahead of the Paris Olympics. There will also be features on the Raptors’ 2019 championship season, with player interviews, and the team’s upcoming 30th anniversary. The Nation Network began as an Edmonton Oilers fan page in 2007 and is now a subsidiary of the sports media group. “With a vision to become the leading digital sports media group globally, Better Collective has identified Canada as a key growth market, and now is the time to expand our offering with the country’s most recognized basketball media personalities,” CEO Jay Downton in a media release. “Hello and Welcome” plans to open the line of communication with listeners through call-ins and special events, generating valuable feedback. “That’s like the greatest satisfaction I get from doing a show with (Lou),” said Wong. “It’s these encounters that we have, whether it’s in real life or messages that we get, just hearing how excited people are about the show and what we’re doing. That stuff is very motivating. “It’s all about what is best for the audience, and we are making this move to create a better pod.”",

        "description": "A veteran Democratic Orangeburg County councilman is facing two political newcomers in the June 11 Democratic primary.",
        "content": "A veteran Democratic Orangeburg County councilman is facing two political newcomers in the June 11 Democratic primary. Orangeburg County Council District 2 Democratic incumbent Johnny Ravenell is facing political newcomers Orangeburg businessman Johnny L. Murdaugh Jr. and Roxxann \"Roshika\" Oliver. Ravenell has not had primary or general election challengers for the seat since first being elected to council in 2003. In that year, Ravenell won the seat to fill the unexpired term of the late James Glover. In that race, he defeated Edward Fludd, a Bowman businessman, Vernon Stephens, then a member of the County Board of Education; Soil and Water Conservation District Chairman Kenneth Ott, and James Ulmer III, who headed the agricultural education department at Elloree High School. Ravenell and Stephens ended up in a runoff with Ravenell coming in victorious by three votes. The winner of the Democratic primary will face Republican Marty Griffin in the Nov. 5 general election. The winner will serve a four-year term. If elected, Murdaugh says he will focus on four primary areas. If elected, Murdaugh said his first action will be commissioning an assessment to determine the perceived needs of the constituents in District 2 and determine the needed projects and their urgency. Murdaugh also said he would \"redesign pathways\" in which council communicates and increase its efficacy between the constituents and the council. \"I will establish key communicators in District 2 to make certain that the constituents are aware of meetings and can voice their needs,\" Murdaugh said. \"I believe in transparency and clarity when it comes to service.\" Murdaugh cited his 31 years of experience as an educator and more than15 years as a principal, \"along with the strength of strong community ties, communicating with people, managing resources, solving problems, and being protective of our children.\" A political newcomer, Murdaugh was born and raised in the Four Holes area of Orangeburg County. He graduated from Orangeburg-Wilkinson High School. Murdaugh received his bachelor’s degree from South Carolina State College, a master’s at the University of Northern Illinois and his doctorate from the University of Sarasota. Murdaugh has served over 30 years in public education as a teacher, assistant principal, curriculum coordinator, principal and district department head. Currently he is the director at the Lake Marion Technology Center in Santee. Murdaugh has served as president of the South Carolina Career and Technology Association, a division of the South Carolina Association of School Administrators; president of the South Carolina Association of Career and Technology Educators; a member of the South Carolina State Department of Education’s Career and Technology Education Advisory Board, and a member of the South Carolina Education and Business Summit Planning Committee. Murdaugh is also a business owner, having part ownership of The Music Doctor Inc. and The MAX Family Entertainment Center. Murdaugh has been involved in the community as a church musician at Victory Tabernacle Deliverance Temple, a member of North Orangeburg United Methodist Church, a past adviser of the Orangeburg Track Club, a member of the NAACP, and co-adviser of the NAACP ACT-SO program and the Youth Council. Murdaugh is a member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity Inc., a past member of the Morning Rotary Club, a member of the former Orangeburg 1000 and the Orangeburg County Chamber of Commerce. Murdaugh has been married for 29 years to Christia and the couple has two children: Sydney Murdaugh, 26, and Jahntia Murdaugh, 21. He enjoys fishing, traveling with his family, and playing his saxophone. Oliver, who is running for political office for the first time, says she would change the county's focus. \"The focus of the county should include initiatives that will strengthen small business and rural towns and communities,\" Oliver said. \"The county should also focus on attracting industry offering good benefits and salaries that will compete with industries in the Summerville and Charleston areas to avoid long commutes by employees on a daily basis.\" \"This will help to keep most of the working-class residents from relocating to other counties,\" Oliver said. Oliver expressed concern that her opponent is \"acting as a representative for real estate developers instead of a representative for the citizens of Orangeburg County, especially District 2.\" Oliver cited examples. She said in October 2019, Councilman Ravenell, during a public meeting in Santee, joined other political leaders in advocating for a development that restricted the ability of Santee residents to fish off the U.S. 15/U.S. 301 bridge. \"Native residents have been fishing at this public bridge long before the establishment of towns around the lake,\" Oliver said. Oliver said she would support replacement of the U.S. 15 and U.S. 301 bridge and the Interstate 95 bridge. \"Without an alternate route across Lake Marion, the county loses economic development opportunities and residents have to endure unsafe and problematic traffic situations,\" Oliver said. \"Due to the frequency of vehicular accidents and crime on interstates, it is safer to have lanes for pedestrians, fishing, biking etc. on the U.S. Highway 15-301 bridge than on Interstate 95 bridge.\" Oliver also said she would advocate for lower taxes. \"In comparison to other counties, taxes in Orangeburg County are high and do not match the services rendered by the county, especially in rural areas,\" Oliver said. Oliver also expressed disappointment that the town of Santee has been \"weakened\" by the discontinuance of water from the Santee water system and purchasing water from the Lake Marion Regional Water Agency. \"As a result, residents are paying higher rates for poor-quality water,\" Oliver said. Oliver said Ravenell also has not listened to residents' concerns about high-density residential communities and planned developments locating in Elloree and Santee. She said she would not support such developments without a proper vetting of how they will impact existing services and taxes. \"Ordinances should not discriminate against the establishment of manufactured homes and small businesses,\" Oliver said. Oliver also accuses Ravenell of practicing favoritism in determining what roads to have paved in his district. Oliver criticized Ravenell's support of a U-turn intersection at U.S. 301 and S.C. 267 rather than having a traffic light put at the intersection. \"The U-turn intersection is not what residents wanted, not as safe for school bus traffic from the nearby school, inconvenient for local motorists and conflicting for nonlocal residents and decreases property values in the area,\" Oliver said. Ravenell declined commenting on Oliver's allegations. Oliver's family was unexpectedly brought into the public eye in October 2020 after the shooting death of her 14-year-old son Tyler Benjamin. The shooting incident occurred as Benjamin was sitting on the porch of his Tee Vee Road home with another male. Someone fired shots from a wooded area. Several arrests were eventually made in the shooting death. Benjamin was an eighth-grader at Holly Hill-Roberts Middle School. She has started a foundation -- \"Giving Back for Tyler\" -- that raises money to feed the homeless. Oliver graduated from Elloree High School. Oliver currently is self-employed as a hair stylist. She formerly worked in the health care industry as a certified nursing assistant. She is the daughter of Gloria and Anthony Shivers. She is the mother of two daughters. Benjamin was her youngest son. She is also heavily involved in youth mentoring. Ravenell is running on his nearly 22 years of service on council. \"I am running for this seat to continue to be a servant for the people of Orangeburg County to make it a better place to live, work and enjoy,\" Ravenell said. He listed the following among the initiatives and accomplishments during his tenure: In addition to his accomplishments, Ravenell currently serves as vice chairman of Orangeburg County Council and also serves on the Lower Savannah Council of Governments board, which covers a six-county region. He also served as chairman of LSCOG during its 50th year. Currently, he also serves on the board of Lake Marion Regional Water Authority. He has been heavily involved in the community, serving as chairman of the Santee Fire Commission, a member of the Bamberg Job Corp Advisory Board and the Senior Citizen Board in Vance. A native and lifelong resident of Santee, Ravenell graduated from Roberts High School in Holly Hill and later attended Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College and received an associate degree in machine technology. He attended the College of Charleston and received a certificate from the SC Economic Development School. He also completed three levels of the Institute of Government for County Officials. Ravenell was employed in Tampa for 15 years as a numerical machine operator. For more than 25 years, he has owned R&R Auto Paint and Body Shop and is also owner and operator of R&R Towing. Ravenell is a deacon at the Chapel Hill Baptist Church. He is married to Verna and is father to Judy, Troy and Kevin. Ravenell enjoys fishing, playing golf and watching sports.

        "description": "Donald Trump was the first president to go on trial on criminal charges.",
        "content": "Closing arguments in Donald Trump's historic hush money trial are slated to begin Tuesday, the final chance prosecutors and the defense will have to present their opposing narratives to sway the jury tasked with deciding the former president's fate. Manhattan prosecutors, through some 20 witnesses called to testify against Trump over the last month, have tried to prove that Trump — the first president or ex-president to go on trial on criminal charges — is guilty of falsifying business records to conceal reimbursement payments he made to his personal attorney Michael Cohen, a Lawrence native. Trump, the GOP's presumptive presidential candidate for 2024, had allegedly directed Cohen to pay $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels to keep their affair secret and therefore safeguard his chances at winning the 2016 presidential election, prosecutors have said. Adult film actress Stormy Daniels testifies on the witness stand at Donald Trump's hush money trial in Manhattan Criminal Court on May 9. Credit: AP/Elizabeth Williams Trump's lawyers have argued that prosecutors only have the word of Cohen — a convicted perjurer and admitted serial liar — on which to hang their case. Also, Trump's lawyers charge, the recording of the payments to Cohen as “legal services” was accurate. Pursuing Trump, they have argued, smacks of politics. And the prosecution's theory that Trump broke state election law? That's just how democracy works — candidates attempt to positively influence the electorate. Trump has also denied the affair. Trump, 77, has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records as part of what prosecutors argue was a ''catch and kill strategy\" to buy negative stories and bury them. Daniels testified as a prosecution witness, giving explicit details of the sexual encounter she allegedly had with Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, in 2006. Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy . The charges have been upgraded to felony-level crimes because Manhattan District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg argued they were part of a conspiracy to cover up another crime — conspiracy to promote an election by unlawful means. Two months after Trump announced his candidacy for president in 2015, according to testimony from David Pecker, the former chairman and publisher of American Media Inc. — the parent company of the National Enquirer — he was summoned by Cohen for a meeting at Trump Tower. “At that meeting Donald Trump and Cohen, they asked me what I can do and what my magazines can do to help the campaign,” Pecker testified. “I said what I would do is I would run or publish positive stories about Mr. Trump and I would publish negative stories about his opponents. I also said that 'I would be your eyes and ears.' I said that anything that I hear in the marketplace, if I hear anything negative about yourself or if I hear anything about selling stories, I would notify Michael Cohen.” That was the birth of what prosecutors alleged in their opening statement to the jury was a “criminal conspiracy” between the three men, in which Pecker and his top editor would alert Cohen to negative stories about Trump that were pitched to the supermarket tabloid by celebrity publicists and lawyers. In three instances, according to prosecutors, Trump paid to silence those making accusations against him, including Daniels. Trump, described as penny-pinching during the trial, was moved to open his wallet in order to save his prospects of winning the 2016 presidential election, according to prosecutors. It was in early October 2016 — about a month before Election Day — when The Washington Post published the “Access Hollywood” video of Trump bragging about grabbing women by their genitals. “When you're a star, they let you do it,” Trump said on the recording, a transcript of which was provided to the jury. Michael Cohen leaves his apartment building on his way to Manhattan Criminal Court on May 20. Credit: AP/Seth Wenig The release of the video was disastrous for the campaign, testified Hope Hicks, a former Trump campaign and White House aide, who also testified she didn't know Cohen to be charitable or selfless, but someone who “seeks” credit. “This is a disaster,” Trump said in an October 2016 phone call with Cohen, according to Trump's former fixer. “This is a total disaster. Women will hate me. Guys will think it's cool but women will hate me. This is a total disaster for the campaign.” Prosecutors also played for the jury a 2-minute, 31-second audio file of Cohen telling Trump about setting up a shell company to make the hush money payments. “I need to open up the company for the transfer of all that info for our friend David. I'm going to do that right away. I’ve spoken to [Trump's then-chief financial officer] Allen Weisselberg about how to set the whole thing up,” Cohen told Trump. “We'll pay cash,” the former president said on the recording. Over days of cross-examination, Trump defense attorney Todd Blanche sought to discredit the Manhattan district attorney’s star witness by painting him as a serial liar and perjurer. Cohen has served prison time after pleading guilty to various federal charges, including lying to Congress and a bank and engaging in campaign-finance violations related to the hush money scheme. Blanche also attempted to paint Cohen as a man out for revenge against Trump, who didn't give him a plum job in the White House. Cohen admitted regularly denouncing Trump on social media and making millions of dollars in proceeds from books he's written about Trump. Cohen also admitted, while under cross-examination, that he stole $30,000 from the Trump Organization when he was reimbursed $50,000 for payments to a computer services company called Red Finch. The defense called Robert Costello, a former federal prosecutor, as a witness for its brief case, to contradict some of Cohen's claims. But Costello, a Nassau resident, was almost removed from the witness stand after he muttered “ridiculous” and “jeez” in a show of apparent annoyance with Supreme Court Justice Juan M. Merchan's rulings. Trump, despite saying multiple times he would testify, did not take the stand, as is his right as a criminal defendant.",

        "description": "Nassau County police are looking at the 1981 disappearance of Audrey Chin, who recently was added to the database known as NamUs, the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System",
        "content": "It was July 7, 1981, that 20-year-old Audrey Chin drove to a veterinary office near her family home on Ross Lane in East Norwich to pick up Joy, the family tabby cat who had just been spayed. Chin who was driving her mother’s Chevy Nova, returned with the pet and then drove away again, ostensibly to go shopping for her mother. She was never seen again. About three weeks later, the mud-splattered Chevy was found by police about 10 miles from the Chin home in the parking lot of the now-closed Plainview Diner at Manetto Hill Road and Old Country Road. The car doors had been locked, but inside the vehicle police found Chin’s purse, her wallet and some other items. Some cigarette ash was found on the floorboard (Chin didn’t smoke), and two of the tires were flat. But there was no lead to the whereabouts of the young woman who was studying to be a nurse. In recent weeks, Nassau County police have signaled renewed interest in the case, part of what one law enforcement source said was a new effort by the department to focus on cold cases.

In March, Chin’s two older sisters — Patsy Sant’Angelo, 66, of New Jersey, and Frances Creed, 64, of Port Jefferson — said they traveled to police headquarters in Mineola at the request of investigators to give DNA reference samples. The sisters were told that their genetic material will be used to run through the national CODIS database, the system overseen by the FBI that law enforcement agencies use to identify unknown human remains or crime suspects. Chin's case is one of the oldest missing persons cases in Nassau County. Over the years — other than one or two news stories — there has been virtually no publicity about it. It took until Feb. 8 of this year, almost 44 years after her disappearance, for Chin’s case to become an official entry in the database known as NamUs, the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, which was started in 2007 by the U.S. Department of Justice. It is not clear why Chin's case took so long to get listed. There are 17 sets of unidentified human remains in CODIS from Nassau County, and about 100 sets of unidentified remains in Suffolk, officials said. In a statement to Newsday, Nassau police spokesman Detective Lt. Richard LeBrun said the inclusion of the Chin case in NamUs hopefully will help solve the case. The department’s missing persons unit monitors NamUs cases and cross references them with other databases, LeBrun said. Still, getting results may take time. According to Emanuel Katranakis, a retired NYPD chief of forensic investigations, the process of running the family DNA profiles could take months, depending upon the urgency and public safety ramifications of previous requests in the search queues. “Two to four months” was Katranakis’s estimate of the duration of the CODIS search in the Chin case. Kinship analysis of the results also might add to the timing since it is a “labor intensive process,” Katranakis added. Kinship analysis would solidify any family relationships between unidentified remains and the Chin sisters. All three women also would have the same mitochondrial DNA, which is passed down to children from the maternal side. There is no guarantee the DNA samples submitted will match any known profiles in the CODIS system. But the Nassau police interest has given both of Chin's sisters hope that after years of hearing nothing from officials the mystery might be solved. “I do think they are really trying to help,” Patsy Sant’Angelo said of the Nassau police missing persons investigation. “The department continues to stay in touch with the Chin family and is always looking for new leads,” said LeBrun, adding that the department has used detectives from various units and utilized “updated technology” in the search.

Credit: Frances Creed via Facebook Since Chin disappeared, her sisters and parents searched through her old belonging, letters and other documents and made a shocking discovery. The sisters said that some of the letters uncovered indicated that Chin harbored a secret: She was having an affair with an older, married man. Chin, an introspective and artistic woman, was never known in her days as a student in Oyster Bay High School to have dated or had any boyfriends. Evidence of such an affair stunned her sisters. “I was shocked, totally surprised ... shocked that my sister was involved with a married man,” Patsy Sant’Angelo said. What was also distressing was that the man in question — who died more than a decade ago — had been considered a friend and might have known what had happened to Chin, Patsy Sant’Angelo speculated. The sisters said they were told by investigators not to approach the deceased man’s family because of the investigation. Patsy Sant'Angelo and Frances Creed said the bulk of the letters were turned over to Nassau police, and the sisters have been trying without success to get back some copies of the correspondences. For Sant'Angelo and Creed, the letters are the only tangible things left from their sister. Frances Creed told Newsday she suspected Chin was having a secret relationship when she overheard her sobbing on the telephone the day she disappeared. But even under her sister’s gentle questioning, Chin didn’t want to speak about what was bothering her. “She was obviously upset on the phone, and before I left the house I said something to the effect that I will talk to you later,” Frances remembered of the last conversation she had with Chin.

Credit: Craig Ruttle To revive interest in Chin and to search for possible leads, the sisters, with the help of their respective spouses, Russell Sant’Angelo and Bob Creed, have maintained a Facebook page titled “Audrey Chin Never Forget-Never Give Up.” The couples also have been searching for Chin’s old friends and anyone else who might have information. The sisters are aware of two unidentified bodies found within a few miles of the old family home in East Norwich. The cases are described in the NamUs inventory for Nassau County, and under normal procedures should be undergoing comparison in the latest DNA search. One set of remains were those of a woman whose estimated height was between 4-foot-9 and 5 feet — Chin was 4-foot-9. The remains were found in 2003 by hiking Boy Scouts in Muttontown Preserve, an area famous for containing the ruins of the old estate of King Zog of Albania. The location is about a mile from the old Chin family home. Another set of remains, known to some as “Lattingtown Jane Doe,” was found at the end of Sheep Lane in Lattingtown, close to Long Island Sound in January 2013 and just over four miles from the Chin home. The Lattingtown skeleton was found in a garbage bag amid indications it had been at the site for a long time. If the mystery of Audrey Chin is solved, it will come too late for her parents, both of whom immigrated from China in the tumultuous period surrounding World War II and made a living for years with their laundry business in East Norwich. The couple worked hard to make the business a success and provide for their daughters, relatives said. Audrey’s mother, Helen Chin, whose Chinese name was Wai Ping Chin, had a small shrine in the house to commemorate her lost daughter, complete with photographs and incense. She spoke with a fortuneteller in Hong Kong who said Chin was dead but at peace. But she never talked much about her missing child with her two other daughters. Helen Chin died in 2017. The girls’ father, John Chin, whose Chinese name was Guey Shing Chin, also kept his anguish private, never talking about Audrey’s disappearance, the daughters said. He also died later. The sisters don't believe Audrey Chin ran away, since her bank accounts weren’t touched. Chin, who had graduated from high school in 1979, had many plans, including being in Patsy’s wedding party in September 1981, and was taking courses to prepare for nursing school. They think it is more likely Chin met with foul play, but they know that without the discovery of any remains, the question of what happened may never be answered. “The person I think was involved in her disappearance is no longer alive today,” Patsy Sant'Angelo said. “Can we get any more information? You know, I am not super hopeful.” The sisters’ sense of loss is heightened by the fact that Chin was never able to have a full life, as they did, to come into her own and experience the simple pleasures of being an adult. “She should have been able to marry and have children,” said Patsy Sant'Angelo, her voice again breaking with emotion. “She didn’t have the opportunity to grow, to change, to have a life.” Anthony M.

        "content": "After Philip G. Maniaci’s mother died of brain cancer when he was 8, neighbors and family friends pitched in to help care for him. Now 79, Maniaci said those helping hands had a lasting impact, inspiring him as an adult to give back to his own community through hundreds of blood and platelet donations, as well as through leadership roles in organizations such as the Knights of Columbus, Deer Park Lions Club and Deer Park Fire Department. “I saw people helping me when I was a kid, and I guess that inspired me and put something in my head,” Maniaci said of the death of his mother, Sarah. “So, when I got older I figured I would help people back. It’s my nature.” Maniaci said he served four years in the U.S. Air Force — including a three-month stint building Quonset huts in Vietnam — during the 1960s. He relocated from the Bronx to Deer Park in 1974 with his wife, Gloria, and spent 36 years working for American Airlines, for which he said he served as a crew chief at LaGuardia Airport in Queens until his retirement in 2003. In 1979, Maniaci said he joined the Knights of Columbus’ Our Lady of the Rosary Council No. 4428 in Deer Park and worked his way up the ranks until he reached the top position of grand knight in 2010. From breaking news to special features and documentaries, the NewsdayTV team is covering the issues that matter to you. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy . Now the organization’s blood drive chairman for Suffolk County, Maniaci has donated blood 370 times over the past 31⁄2 decades. He has made close to 300 platelet donations and given more than 46 gallons of blood, he said. “I had a friend whose wife passed away from cancer, and he asked me if I would go give platelets, because cancer patients can’t produce the platelets in their bodies,” Maniaci said. “So I went with him once and I’ve been going ever since, starting back in 1990.” Maniaci’s service doesn’t end there. He has been a member of the Deer Park Fire Department since 1979, and has been the president and safety officer, as well as head of the Deer Park Volunteer Exempt Firemens Benevolent Association. He is also involved with the Sons of Italy’s Constantino Brumidi Lodge No. 2211 in Deer Park and the Deer Park Lions Club, the latter of which he has served as treasurer and president. Maniaci has also been a scoutmaster for the Boy Scouts of America’s Troop 157 in Deer Park, a coach in the Deer Park Little League and an usher at the Roman Catholic Church of Saints Cyril & Methodius in Deer Park. His decades-long community involvements led to him being named 2024 Senior of the Year in March for the Suffolk County Legislature’s 17th Legislative District. “Phil Maniaci leads by example and, in doing so, has inspired countless others to also give back,” said Legis. Tom Donnelly (D-Deer Park), who recently presented him with a proclamation for being named Senior of the Year. “I am thrilled to recognize this community icon, someone I consider not just a role model and mentor, but also that I am lucky to call a friend. His honesty, integrity and lifetime of dedication and public service make him truly deserving of being honored.” Michael R.

        "description": "The town plans to repeal zoning changes that would have allowed mixed-use multifamily housing in Inwood and North Lawrence.",
        "content": "Five years ago, Hempstead officials began a bipartisan effort to transform a jumble of commercial and residential areas near the commuter rail stations in Inwood and North Lawrence into a walkable, vibrant community. That effort stalled and the town now plans to repeal sections of its zoning code to prevent such mixed-use multifamily housing in the area from being built. The Hempstead Town Board scheduled a June 4 hearing to rescind the town’s transit-oriented development overlay district for Inwood and North Lawrence as well as a neighborhood business district that allows apartments to be built over ground-floor businesses and a town house and row house overlay district. The language of the repeal states it is needed because “concerns have been raised that the approval procedures for projects in these \"districts do not represent best practices for ensuring that a ‘hard look’ is taken at several potentially significant negative environmental impacts” from development. The measure states that an \"expedited review process\" under the code \"does not provide for a meaningful level of public scrutiny\" and doesn't \"properly examine\" the cumulative effect of multiple projects being built in the area. 2019: Hempstead Town Board approves transit-oriented development zoning change in Inwood and North Lawrence. 2022: Hempstead Town Board imposes moratoriums on such projects. 2024: Hempstead Town Board to consider repealing zoning change. The proposal states the zoning “could have significant negative impacts on, among other things, community character and quality of life” and that it represents a “threat to public health, safety and welfare.” The town board in 2022 placed pauses on projects being built under the zoning codes. The moratoriums were extended in 2023 and 2024, with the latest extension expiring June 18. One project planned under the transit-oriented development zoning overly is at 25 Wanser Ave. in Inwood. In 2021, the Hempstead Industrial Development Agency approved tax breaks for the $154 million, 313-unit apartment building on behalf of 25 Wanser LLC, a subsidiary of Commack-based Heatherwood Luxury Rentals, records show. Attempts to reach company officials and its attorney were unsuccessful Friday. The town board approved a plot plan for the project last year, records show. Town spokesman Casey Sammon on Friday said this project would be grandfathered in under the proposed repeal. Under the repeal, the town would allow projects that have already received certain approvals to move forward. Town Supervisor Donald Clavin Jr. declined to be interviewed. Town spokesman Brian Devine didn’t identify any other projects that could be grandfathered in. Sammon issued a statement saying, “The Town Board looks forward to working with area residents to decide the best path forward.” The zoning changes for the overlay districts for transit-oriented development, neighborhood business and town houses and row houses in Inwood and North Lawrence approved in 2019 were spearheaded by then-Supervisor Laura Gillen and then-Councilman Bruce Blakeman, who is now Nassau County executive. The purpose of the zoning, according to an 877-page environmental report commissioned by the town and released in 2019, was “to create vibrant walkable hamlet centers, each with a distinctive sense of place, around the Inwood and Lawrence LIRR train stations with mixed-use development and housing choices.” Eric Alexander, director of Vision Long Island, a downtown planning organization, said Hempstead’s effort to repeal its zoning code is a pushback to efforts in Albany to get more housing built. In 2023, Gov. Kathy Hochul sought to force communities to allow increased housing density within a half mile radius of Long Island Rail Road stations. That effort failed in the face of opposition from suburban elected officials. “We're seeing the backlash,” Alexander said. “This is part of it.” At a March 12 hearing to extend the moratorium, speakers against development were largely drawn from the village of Lawrence and Woodmere and expressed concerns about potential increases in traffic and strains on infrastructure by adding new residents. Most speakers in favor of development identified themselves as members of the construction industry and stressed the need for more housing on Long Island and the jobs that new construction would bring. That hearing was a contrast to the May 7, 2019, hearing when the zoning codes were adopted. At that hearing, speaker after speaker spoke of revitalizing a blighted area and bringing much needed housing to the area. Kyle Strober, executive director of the Association for a Better Long Island, co-wrote a letter to the town in March asking it to lift the moratorium to allow development to move forward. In a statement about the expected repeal of the zoning overlays, Strober said, “While it’s disappointing that these overlay districts will be eliminated, we have been reassured that the Town will work with any developer looking to build housing in these zones.”",

        "content": "New York Post | Greg Joyce : The Yankees’ offense has been thriving of late, but there has been a bit of a weakness in the last month at third base while the team has awaited the return of DJ LeMahieu. After missing the first two months of the season, DJ is finally set to come back from the injured list and assume his role as the starting third baseman. If DJ can provide solid defense and average hitting, he’ll extend an already fantastic lineup all the way through the nine slot. NJ.com | Randy Miller : Juan Soto’s presence and performance in the Bronx has put himself in the AL MVP conversation. It’s going as well as it could have possibly gone. On the Padres’ side, that hasn’t been the case. Michael King has been solid, but not better than average. Aside from King, the rest of the players in the deal have not performed. Drew Thorpe was a key player in yielding the team Dylan Cease, but boy the Padres were likely expecting more from Randy Vásquez and Jhony Brito. It’s still early and those players have several years of team control, but right now, it’s looking like there will be no regrets. New York Post | Greg Joyce: The Yankee rotation has been dominant. As Miller pointed out, they’ve been on a historic run of 14 straight games of two runs allowed with at least five innings. Their team era sits at 2.72 and they have given a shallow bullpen some needed rest. With Gerrit Cole lurking in the near future, there are questions bound to come. For now, they will continue to enjoy the great success as Nestor Cortes takes the mound later today in hopes of extending the historic stretch. USA Today | Bob Nightengale : The long, polarizing career of Ángel Hernanádez has come to a close. After three decades of being the baseball common enemy, he has decided that his game from May 9th would be his last. Hernanádez was in peak(?) form at the start of the year, with terrible calls and “main character” reactions as usual. While it’s nice to know the umpiring average score has improved as a result of the retirement, some might miss having the heel to blame. Enjoy your retirement, Ángel.",

        "description": "The actor stars with his wife and son at Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor through June 16.",
        "content": "John Slattery became a household name over \"Mad Men's\" seven-season run, but there's a lot more to this name than Roger Sterling, the silver-haired and silver-tongued mentor to Don Draper. He was one of the stars of ABC's too-short-lived \"Homefront\" ('91-93), and more recently of Oscar winner \"Spotlight\" (2015). In between, he had memorable roles on \"Sex and the City,\" \"Desperate Housewives,\" \"Veep,\" \"30 Rock,\" \"Arrested Development\" and since 2010 has been Howard Stark of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Then, there's theater. In a stage career that began in the late '80s, this Boston native, 61, has appeared on Broadway four times, most recently in the 2016 revival of the Ben Hecht/Charles MacArthur classic \"The Front Page\" (quite the stretch: He played Hildy Johnson, the role immortalized by Rosalind Russell in \"His Girl Friday\"). Now, on to the more intimate setting of Sag Harbor's Bay Street Theater, where he'll appear with his wife, Talia Balsam, and son, Harry Slattery, in \"The Subject Was Roses,\"' in previews May 28-31, then running June 1 through June 16 and directed by Scott Wittman. Slattery and Balsam won't have far to commute -- both have a home in Springs. Slattery recently spoke about the play, which concerns a young man who return home to his family in the Bronx after World War II, and much more. Get the latest on celebs, TV and more.

You were also at Bay Street last year for the New Works festival and a reading of \"Another Lovely Day.\" [Playwright] Leslie Ayvazian is a friend and she wrote a three-character play — we did a reading with our son who was the proper age for the role [\"Day\" is about a family in the wake of 9/11]. Victor Garber, who lives out on the East End and saw it said, 'Well [Harry] can act.' He's a friend of Scott Wittman's and I guess that put the idea in Scott's head to do this. \"The Subject Was Roses\" had a Eugene O'Neill vibe that audiences really responded to back in the mid-'60s. But why this dark, bitter play — and why now? It was the circumstances of us being right for all three parts. They are terrific and it's a really well-written play — funny, dark, emotional. It's also a good place for Harry to kind of make his debut under friendly circumstances and out of the full, bright lights of New York City. But why then, why now? I would guess the themes of familial dysfunction are universal and timeless, as well as generational miscommunications — the idea of a family incapable of expressing love for one another even though they love each other is something everyone can identify with. On Broadway, Jack Albertson played John as a hard-bitten, hard-drinking emotionally abusive spouse with a secret history. You seem too nice to play the guy — I guess that's why it's called acting — but is there anything in the role you can relate to? I come from a long line of Irish — not so much drunk, but Irish and temperamental. He's good with a turn of phrase and a salesman — my father was a salesman, too — so I understood the character. The specifics of course are different and the circumstances unique to the play. I familiarized myself with the original cast recording for our chat. It's sad and often elliptical. Sad because of their struggles but it's what you want [as an actor] — something to play against, with a lot of obstacles. In their relationship, they're on to each other which is what happens after 25 years — they've been together 25 years — and we've [Slattery and Balsam] been together 25 years, too. You know someone [after that amount of time] and not necessarily because of something they've divulged but you read between the lines. They're good parts. Listening to the record, I kept thinking of the set in \"The Honeymooners.\" Will yours be that austere? We have the great Derek McClane as scenic designer. The theater has a proscenium, with the audience on three sides, so the requirements of the space dictate something different. I wouldn't say austere, although the characters are middle-class, working people. But there might be a little more dreamlike quality to the set — I think Edward Hopper has been mentioned. Tell me a little bit about Harry. He's 24 and he's impressed the hell out of all of us. He's just a great young man and he's decided this is what he wanted to do, although he didn't study acting in college. But he's just done a remarkable job [in rehearsals]. He's been openhearted and open-minded about the whole thing. You've been in so many series over the decades — any that a reader might be surprised to learn that you were in? For me it's got to be \"Ed\" — who knew! Or remembered? I did an episode of \"Father Dowling Mysteries\" that was probably the dumbest thing I ever did — a hit man. But I did get a free trip to Colorado — they shot out in Denver — so I got to go skiing. And I just did a season of \"The Good Fight,\" which I was not that familiar with but got to work with the great Christine Baranski. So, nearly a decade since \"Mad Men\" wrapped. Any favorite memories? The cast was so tight that we'd sit around after shooting our scenes and have beers and unwind before dealing with the traffic. They even built us a deck behind the trailers on the studio lot as a place to hang out because nobody ever seemed to want to go home. Robert Morse would even come by on days when he wasn't shooting just to hang out. We had these long-running cribbage games that went on for days. It was just great. Ever get tired of \"Mad Men\" questions? You've done so much else over your career. No! How could you top that and why would you have to top that? It doesn't get much better and I was very lucky I had anything to do with it. It was really a special moment in time which we all [the cast and crew] recognized as special. It wasn't like we wrapped and said well, 'I wish I'd appreciated it more.' We appreciated the hell out of every minute. Ok, my admittedly facetious \"favorite role\" question: Who did you like to play best — Howard Stark, Roger or that guy on \"Sex and the City?\" Hard to beat Roger Sterling, just for the writing on that show. I made some of the greatest friendships of my life from there, and Harry was just six years old when it started. And hard to beat it for the impact it's had on my life. Directing has also been important in your career — a number of \"Mad Men\" episodes, the 2014 indie flick \"God's Pocket\" with Philip Seymour Hoffman, and last year's \"Maggie Moore(s),\" with Jon Hamm. Do you prefer being in front of or behind the camera? I wouldn't say directing [although] directing helps me as an actor by recognizing that the acting is just a piece of the puzzle between the edit and the music and all the other elements that go into the finished product. What's next for you? I just finished a couple months shooting a movie in Budapest, with Rami Malek, Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon called 'Nuremberg' [based on the 2013 Jack El-Hai book, about Hermann Göring and his American psychiatrist, 'The Nazi and the Psychiatrist'] then literally started rehearsals for this the next day.

        "description": "Building the addition could take six to eight months, followed by additional time to allow for the hiring of two technicians and the purchase and installation of equipment.",
        "content": "Construction could begin within the next 30 days on a forensics lab addition that would enable Cumberland County to establish a firearm testing unit for the district attorney’s office within the next year to 18 months. Building the addition could take six to eight months, followed by additional time to allow hire two technicians and purchase and install the specialized testing equipment, District Attorney Sean McCormack said. “We’ve been going through the permit approval process,” he said. “We had to check all those boxes. We have done that. We are ready to start construction within the next month or so.” In late April 2023, former Commissioner Vince DiFilippo and current Commissioner Jean Foschi approved a $2.26 million capital project to establish the testing unit. They voted in favor of buying the equipment, hiring the technicians and building the addition to accommodate the unit at the lab at 1201 Ritner Highway. Citing concerns over future costs, Commissioner Gary Eichelberger voted against the project that will use a $1.5 million Gun Violence Investigation and Prosecution Grant from the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency. Having a testing unit in the county lab would reduce the turnaround time to obtain results, McCormack said. Right now, the county must send each firearm off to either a lab in New Jersey or to the Pennsylvania State Police crime lab, where backlogs exist, he said. “Firearms are not only taken in shootings,” McCormack said. “There are everyday occurrences where police come across the illegal possession of a firearm. To prove those charges in court, we need to prove operability – one of the things that gets tested in the lab. We will have more control over how long the testing takes if we do this in-house.” In March 2023, McCormack outlined three ways the testing unit could generate revenue for the county to recoup annual operating costs. Within three to four years, the testing unit could be established enough to accept firearms for testing from nearby counties and then charge those counties for providing the service. Also, in convictions involving firearms, his office could gradually recoup the expense by including the lab testing as a prosecution cost in sentences handed down by county judges. Yet another funding source could be the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms that is trying to encourage local agencies to use NIBIN. Short for the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network, NIBIN is a database where expended bullet casings can be compared with ballistic imagery from other jurisdictions to general leads on possible matches in violent crime. A NIBIN technician is one of the two full-time positions that will be supported by the grant. “There is competition for people who have those particular skills,” McCormack said. “I hope it’s not going to be too much of a challenge.” The county could pursue a national certification of the firearm testing unit, he said. McCormack said having such a credential strengthens the credibility of lab results in court cases. “Somebody from outside the lab has come in and looked at our procedures, our policies, the way we’re doing things and said we’re doing it right.” The county lab is already nationally certified in other areas of forensics, he said. A “slow starvation of law enforcement” is believed to be the cause why only 51% of homicides are solved. Veuer’s Maria Mercedes Galuppo has the story. Get local news delivered to your inbox!

        "description": "The U.S. Attorney's Office is suing after the East Hampton Housing Authority wouldn't let a teenager's emotional support dog, \"Lucky\" the morkie, live with him for 19 months.",
        "content": "A new federal lawsuit alleges an East Hampton agency violated federal housing law by refusing to let a teenager with “mental health and other medical conditions” live with his emotional support dog for 19 months before reversing its stance. The East Hampton Housing Authority repeatedly denied resident Kerry Morouney’s request for her son’s dog, a morkie named Lucky, to live in the Accabonac Apartments unit where the family has resided since April 2021, according to the complaint. The agency, which has its own board of commissioners and isn't funded through town taxes, manages affordable housing developments. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development found “reasonable cause existed to believe that illegal discriminatory housing practices had occurred,” according to the lawsuit. HUD referred the case to the U.S. Attorney's Office, which filed the litigation on May 9 on the family's behalf and later declined to comment. Morouney, 36, cited legal advice while declining to comment in an email. The lawsuit names the housing authority, its executive director, Catherine Casey, and the property owner, Seymour Schutz LLC, as defendants. Attorney Suzanne Marie Messer of Syracuse, who represents the defendants, and Casey didn't return requests for comment. The litigation says in February 2021, Casey told Morouney only “bona fide service animals” were allowed in the apartment complex and an emotional support dog was considered a pet. It says the housing authority then reversed its stance in October 2022. But in the months without Lucky, the young man, then 14 and 15, suffered “increased night terrors, panic attacks, insomnia, nauseousness, vomiting, and decreased appetite,” and missed “significant time” in school, according to the complaint. It says the teenager has “major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD, insomnia with night terrors, irritable bowel syndrome and eosinophilic esophagitis.” The teenager's health improved once Lucky moved in again, according to the complaint. The lawsuit alleges the housing authority violated protections for people with disabilities under the federal Fair Housing Act by “refusing to make reasonable accommodations to their rules, policies, or services.” It says HUD issued guidance in 2020 stating that “assistance animals are not pets.” The lawsuit seeks monetary damages for out-of-pocket expenses and emotional distress. Elizabeth Grossman, executive director of the Fair Housing Justice Center, a nonprofit focused on eliminating housing discrimination in the New York City region, said HUD can use this type of litigation “as an example to prevent similar actions by other housing providers.” Residents in 25 units at Accabonac Apartments get rent assistance through the federal Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program, according to the housing authority. The program helps very low-income families, the elderly and the disabled afford housing. The lawsuit says Morouney's family was living in Utah in early 2021 when she began transferring a housing choice voucher to the East Hampton Housing Authority to move into Accabonac Apartments. A housing authority employee noted in a February 2021 email to Morouney that emotional support dogs were prohibited, according to the complaint. Morouney and her son had been living with Lucky since 2018. The dog, which was in training to be a service dog, helped comfort the boy during panic attacks, the lawsuit says. It adds that the mother submitted documentation from her son’s medical provider, citing his health history and the benefit of an emotional support dog. But without approval to bring the dog to the new apartment, the family left Lucky with a friend in Illinois before moving to East Hampton in 2021, according to the complaint. It says Morouney requested a “reasonable accommodation to keep Lucky” that May after her son's health declined while living without Lucky, but the housing authority said having a dog “would jeopardize” their tenancy. The mother filed a complaint with HUD in June 2021 before the department “attempted conciliation without success,” according to the lawsuit.

        "description": "The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act was proclaimed in 2001, and hasn't been comprehensively reviewed since. The Canadian Immigration Lawyers Association wants it reformed.",
        "content": "An immigrant travelling abroad for an emergency, like attending a funeral, without a valid permanent resident card and shut out of Canada. A foreign worker with expired temporary residence status and forced to stop working while the restoration application is in process. A relative coming to reunite with family whose immigration application package was returned with a requirement to resubmit months later because it was incomplete. Every day lawyers see migrants caught up in these situations, because the law has not kept up with an increasingly complex immigration system, contributing to other problems faced by both applicants and immigration officials. “Many of the ways the law is currently interpreted and applied have a significant effect on the lives of those who navigate the system,” said Toronto immigration lawyer Randy Hahn. “And lives can be unexpectedly disrupted, given the twists and turns in immigration law.” The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) was proclaimed in 2001, adopted to replace legislation introduced in 1976. It has not been comprehensively reviewed since it came in. Meanwhile, Canada’s demographic, social and economic priorities have been rapidly changing, with the court injecting new meanings to the rules with its own interpretations. Hahn said it’s time to closely examine Canada’s immigration law and ensure that it evolves. Last summer, he and other experienced counsel with the Canadian Immigration Lawyers Association formed a committee to review the bible of the country’s immigration law based on input from its 500 members who apply these rules day in, day out. After almost a year of labour, they are releasing a report Tuesday with recommendations to repeal sections that are outdated, serve limited purpose and perpetuate discrimination; amend parts to address inconsistencies in the legislation; and add changes to fill gaps. “To the extent possible, the immigration arrangements ought to avoid adding unnecessarily complications to people’s lives,” Hahn said of the end goal in updating the two-decade-old IRPA. The report, titled offers a number of fixes to some of the most common problems and concerns. Hahn said the wording of the current law is ambiguous and has been interpreted to mean that applicants must be physically present in Canada to apply for their permanent resident card, a document for immigrant to re-enter the country. There seems to be no legitimate policy to justify it. Currently it takes 77 days for a newcomer to get their first permanent resident card and 65 days to renew or replace it. But in between, there could be emergencies or delays leading to someone having to leave the country without a valid card. As a result, they have to apply for a one-time travel document for their return, which is not guaranteed. “People should be able to get their permanent resident card from abroad the same way you can a passport,” said Hahn. “It’s ultimately a travel document.” There has been an — estimated at 2.5 million, including visitors, and . Their status expires and they transition between programs. They have the so-called “maintained status” while they’re between programs. “Not surprisingly, the immigration (department) resource allocation is that those applications are not at the top of the pile,” said Hahn. “But if you leave Canada, you lose your maintained status.” The report recommends that the law be changed to let applicants leave the country but keep their status so they are not stranded here while waiting months for the new documents to come through. It also suggested changing the law to allow those who lose their legal status due to inadvertent mistakes like missing a deadline can get maintained status while their restoration application is processed, so they don’t fall through the cracks. Currently the law allows the immigration minister to issue special instructions to economic immigration programs, such as prioritizing processing of applicants with select backgrounds, at will. While it allows the immigrant selection system to be agile and responsive to changing needs, this could create instability and uncertainty for applicants. The report recommends the law be changed to create a 60-day notice period allowing for commentary on these ministerial instructions regarding the economic class. And the minister would have to provide reasons for the change. “This recommendation will increase transparency, predictability and accountability in a class that is crucial to Canada’s economic performance,” it noted. Currently the law says a foreign national can be barred from entry on health grounds if their condition is expected to cause excessive demand on health or social services. In 2018, then Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen promised to repeal the rules in response to a parliamentary report recommendation. The promise remains unfulfilled. “The subsection perpetuates discrimination by viewing people with health conditions solely as potential financial burdens and ignoring their potential contributions,” said the report. “There are other tools to protect public health.” The pandemic has exacerbated some of the pre-existing challenges for the Immigration Department, contributing to application backlogs in every program. Many applicants have to seek help from their MPs and courts or make inquiries through access-to-information requests to immigration officials, who are not responsive or transparent about their applications. “People try to communicate with Immigration through webforms, which sounds good,” said Hahn. “But trying to get a meaningful and helpful acknowledgment in response can be very difficult.” Creating a public-facing ombudsman, similar to many government departments, can improve the immigration system and lessen the workloads of MPs’ offices and the Federal Court. Other recommendations include removing the broad-stroke five-year entry bar against anyone for misrepresentation; stipulating that the Immigration Department’s application completeness check must be done within 30 days; and recognizing proxy marriages (where one of the spouses is not present in person) given advances in video technology. The report will be submitted to the federal government for consideration.",

        "description": "Students from across the Island displayed their talents in competitions last month.",
        "content": "Nineteen local students won first place in a state competition that challenged them to explore local, regional, national and international history. The New York State History Day competition, held this past April at SUNY Oneonta, included projects from hundreds of students statewide based on the theme “Turning Points in History.” Groups or individuals conducted research through libraries, archives, museums and oral interviews in one of five categories: documentary, exhibit, paper, performance or website. This year’s winning projects tackled topics ranging from the role in childhood development of the educational television series “Sesame Street” to tennis legend and gender equality advocate Billie Jean King’s impact on women. To reach the state level, the students first competed in the Long Island History Day contest in March. Their projects were chosen from out of 330 entries. “To see so many young people passionate about history really inspires me,” said Allison Sobel, the regional coordinator for Long Island History Day. From breaking news to special features and documentaries, the NewsdayTV team is covering the issues that matter to you. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy . Long Island’s first-place winners at the state level and their schools are Jack Basner, Jimmy Eichner, Johanna Ginu and Madeline Rong, The Wheatley School in Old Westbury; Eliana Lau, Neha Paul, Maya Purohit, Harvir Singh, Aanika St. Jean and Zarah Zohir, Herricks Middle School in Albertson; Hannah Chusid, Ananya Kavi, Maria Khan, Jay Patel and Nishita Srirama, Jericho Middle School; Metta Pollio, North Shore High School in Glen Head; and Raphael Croog, Gavin Finkel and Jacob Torczyner, Davis Renov Stahler Yeshiva High School for Boys in Woodmere. The first- and second-place winners in each category will go on to the national competition at the University of Maryland on June 9-13. A team of six Garden City High School students won first place in this year’s Medical Marvels competition, hosted by the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research and Northwell Health’s Center for Workforce Readiness. The competition, held in April, challenged participants to write research papers and present ways to improve educational inclusion for individuals with disabilities. Garden City’s project, EyeDesk, proposed using assistive technology, digital learning platforms and artificial intelligence to enhance educational accessibility. Some items, for example, included a sensory board, illuminated buttons and facial recognition software. The winning team members, who collectively received an $1,800 scholarship, were Clara Archer, Anais Bardizbanian, Cailin Gately, Alexandra Gregory, Breckin Kammerer and Giuliana Pamatat. Paul J. Gelinas Junior High School ninth grader Amanda Liang won first place at Brookhaven National Laboratory’s 45th Annual Bridge Building Competition, which challenged local youth to build basswood structures and test how much weight they could support. This year’s competition, held in April, included 240 bridges from 14 schools across Long Island. Liang’s winning bridge had an efficiency of 3,441.43. Efficiency is calculated using the bridge’s mass and the amount of weight it can support before breaking or bending more than one inch. Second and third place went to Alexander Song and Daniel Liang, both of Ward Melville High School in East Setauket. Six Long Island seniors have been named winners of Otto Kahn Awards from Friends of Oheka, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the protection, preservation and public awareness of Oheka Castle in Huntington. They each received $3,000 and were invited to either perform or have their work shown during an annual gala at the castle in May. The winners are Margaret Nemazi, Cold Spring Harbor High School; Peter Hoss, Harborfields High School in Greenlawn; Brian Ou, Half Hollow Hills High School East in Dix Hills; and Andrew Fogel, Christopher Macaluso and Kaitlyn Mondry, Walt Whitman High School in Huntington Station. Eligible students were required to be majoring in fine arts, performing arts or music. Michael R. Ebert is an education researcher and has worked for Newsday in various capacities since 2003.

        "content": "For all the great food it has, Nassau County's South Shore isn't a hotbed of regional Chinese restaurants . When a sign with Mandarin characters popped up on the main drag in Island Park, residents were buzzing about it on Facebook, even before a menu dropped online. China Pavilion is owned by Jimmy Lin, who also operates a casual sushi spot, Himawari, in Long Beach. Lin stepped in to take over the former Hungry Crab when the business began to fail. He thinks Chinese food is a safer bet in this neighborhood, which is awash with Chinese takeout spots but doesn't have many sit-down restaurants. He found two chefs, one Cantonese and one from the Sichuan region to develop the menu at his new venture. The chefs are making the reverse commute every day from Manhattan's Chinatown to Long Island. When you step into the large but darkly lit space, the first thing you'll notice is a multitiered fish tank, often a sign of a great Cantonese restaurant. The room has a retro '70s vibe to it with high-backed booths that recall the cavernous Chinese restaurants of yesteryear. But the opening menu is decidedly more contemporary with a smart mix of Sichuan dishes (Chengdu steamed clams), Asian fusion stalwarts such as lettuce wraps and miso salmon, as well as a few old-school Cantonese dishes. At $40, the “lobster any style” sticks out. The kitchen chops a whole lobster and stir-fries the pieces with the shell still on, displaying the head on a platter alongside its saucy bits. Lin recommends ordering it “golden yolk” style with butter and egg yolk, but even the ginger scallion is so saucy it's an undertaking just getting each piece of meat from the shell. Hot tip: Ask for extra napkins. For all its headaches, the punchy sauce adds an extra dimension of flavor to the supple lobster meat. A whole Peking roast duck at China Pavilion in Island Park comes with housemade pancakes, cucumbers and scallions. Credit: Newsday/Andi Berlin Peking duck is also on the menu here, and it's great. But unless you're in a large group, go for the half-portion ($36) instead of the whole duck, which will set you back $70 and is quite a lot of meat. The housemade crepes at China Pavilion are thicker and heartier than usual, almost like flour tortillas. And that makes it even more substantial when used as a wrapper for the juicy duck and its crispy skin. The essential guide to Long Island dining.

Credit: Newsday/Andi Berlin The most intriguing item is one of the 10 dim sum selections, the crystal shrimp dumplings ($8). Har gow is one of the most common dim sum dishes, but these are plumper and more delicate than usual, a sign of good dim sum. The restaurant will soon start a full dim sum brunch on the weekends — not with the carts, but from the kitchen, which often means better quality. Dim sum in Island Park? Now that's something to celebrate. China Pavilion, 4245 Austin Blvd., Island Park, 516-688-0022, chinapavilionip.com . Open 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, 11:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday. Andi Berlin is from Arizona and does not know where she is going.

        "description": "This is the city's first mayoral race in five decades in which there is no incumbent or clear front-runner.",
        "content": "With just two weeks until Mississauga byelection, numbers from a new poll out today shows that for the first time in decades, there could be a real race for the mayoral seat. It also suggests that the decision of front-runner Carolyn Parrish, who has dropped eight points since the last poll by Liaison Strategies was conducted in April, to this month may have harmed the Most of the gain was seen by Councillor Dipika Damerla, who has narrowed the lead between her and Parrish, only trailing by five per cent. Alvin Tedjo’s campaign also saw a two per cent boost — as the number of undecided voters decreased. The numbers come as the city says it saw a “significant increase in voter turnout” during the advanced voting last weekend. There was a “42 per cent increase compared to the first three days of advance polling in the 2022 municipal election” with over 2,250 voters voting early. And one pollster says the numbers show David Valentin, the Principal at Liaison Strategies said the numbers indicate a “major shift before election day.” Valentin says that “as we reach the final days of the campaign there is a large pool of reliable voters that still hasn’t made up their minds” and this “really could be anyone’s race.” This is Mississauga’s first mayoral race in five decades in which there is no incumbent or clear front-runner. The election was triggered when former mayor Bonnie Crombie stepped down in January to become the leader of the Ontario Liberal Party. The latest poll numbers show that Parrish still leads among decided voters, with 29 per cent saying they will still vote for Parrish, a long-time politician who was a federal MP in the early 2000s and has been a municipal politician for several terms. Damerla has 24 per cent of the decided vote, while Tedjo has 19 per cent, per poll numbers. Valentin says that while Parrish is still leading but with a lead “smaller and more tenuous than before.” In an email, Damerla says she was encouraged by the recent numbers and “also feeling very positive about what we are hearing at the doors” and “overwhelming request for signs.” Damerla says she has an “ambition and practical plan to keep Mississauga affordable and livable” and has been showing up at debates to talk to as many residents as possible. Valentin says that the undecided voter number is also one to watch. “The undecided rate has dropped to 16 per cent among all voters — but it has jumped to 37 per cent among seniors.” He says that could likely be attributed to uncertainty amongst seniors given Parrish’s decision to pull out of the debates. Earlier this month, Parrish said she would not be participating in any f , citing concerns that she was being “personally threatened.” However, she did not share specifics about the nature of the threats. The decision also came days after a debate where Parrish was accused of making controversial statements that critics called transphobic and discriminatory towards refugee claimants — and that has led to criticism on social media. In an email, Parrish said she “remains convinced” that citizens don’t respond to “negative campaigning.” “They value experience, an excellent track record of accomplishments and a solid platform for the future of the city.” “If Parrish is able to win back seniors, she has a very good chance of being mayor but the opportunity is there for the Damerla and Tedjo campaigns to seize the momentum and votes,” he said. The poll was conducted on May 24-25, 2024, the poll surveyed 907 Mississauga residents with a margin of error for the poll is +/- 3.22 per cent, 19 times out of 20. Voters have another chance to vote early on June 1 and June 2. Election day is on June 10.",

        "content": "A major road near Cumberland Valley High School will be closed for at least seven months starting next week. Silver Spring Township reported that work on Hempt Road and a bridge replacement will begin June 3. Hempt Road will be closed to all but local traffic for a minimum of seven months, and detour signs will be placed along the Carlisle Pike, Route 114 and Texaco Road to where that intersects with Hempt and State roads. The road will be closed for a federally funded project to replace the bridge that carries Hempt Road over Hogestown Road. According to the township, the bridge was built in 1952 and is in poor condition. The bridge has an 11-ton posting with severely deteriorated beams and must be inspected on a six-month cycle. The bridge is also narrow, with a width of 22.8 feet, curb to curb, according to the township. While that width can fit passenger vehicles, the township said the road also carries school buses, emergency vehicles and heavy trucks that are heading to either Texaco Petroleum or Hempt Quarry. Silver Spring Township also approved development plans that would put even more traffic on the road, which already carries an estimated 11,388 vehicles daily. Construction on Costco at the corner of the Carlisle Pike and Hempt Road should begin this summer while the road is closed. At its approval meeting earlier this year, officials estimated that the opening date will be summer 2025. Three warehouses are also going to be developed on the former Hempt Farm tract of land, which will put more heavy-vehicle traffic in that area. In addition to plans to remove the existing bridge and construct a new structure, crews will also work on completing road improvements along Hempt Road during this time frame, likely to expand the road to better fit the increased tractor-trailer traffic. The township said the road will remain closed until the project is completed. Three bridges over the Wisconsin River can be yours, free of charge, as long as you can help remove and preserve them.

The lineup, which will be further announced in due course, was put together by the festival’s new creative director Rowan Woods. “It’s such an exciting moment for me to be able to unveil our first session announcements for the 2024 Festival,” said Woods. “They hint at three of our key priorities this year: expanding our international programming, reflecting the increasingly porous boundaries between TV and other sectors and the creative opportunities this brings, and celebrating the success and impact of U.K. talent and programme making. We have lots more news to share in the coming weeks and look forward to convening the industry in Edinburgh in August to reflect on a challenging year and chart a way forward.” The festival, which will include its usual offering of spotlight sessions, panel discussions and masterclasses, will also introduce a new strand this year called Frontiers, which intends to delve into some of the industry’s most pressing issues. It is being overseen by two new advisory committees made up of relevant industry professionals and intends to celebrate creativity and new forms of storytelling, including other sectors such as digital and podcasting. As part of the Frontiers strand Will.I.Am, the multi-platinum music artist, TV producer and tech entrepreneur, will be in conversation with a professor of media and AI, Dr Alex Connock. Former network chief Littlefield will also be in conversation, discussing his time as both a commissioner and producer, while Wilman, who has also produced “The Grand Tour” and “Top Gear,” will be interviewed by Nutopia CEO and Founder, Jane Root, discussing topics including talent wrangling and creativity. The Edinburgh TV Festival is set to take place in Scotland from Aug. 20 to 23.",

        "content": "A rash of lithium-ion battery fires — some deadly — has spurred New York lawmakers to approve a series of bills to regulate how the batteries are sold, charged and stored. The package of five measures is aimed at e-bikes, or electronic bicycles, and not so much at large battery storage plants such as the East Hampton one that caught fire in 2023. The State Senate passed the bills last Tuesday; the Assembly did so earlier this year. Gov. Kathy Hochul will have to sign or veto the bills by the year’s end. Here’s what to know: The action comes following a dramatic increase in e-bike fires, including hundreds annually in New York City. In 2022, city officials said they were responding to an average of nearly four such fires each week. Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy . Perhaps the most tragic, high-profile event occurred last June in Manhattan’s Chinatown, when an explosion in an e-bike shop triggered a blaze that spread to upper-floor apartments, killing four people. Investigators said it was caused by a lithium-ion battery, which can overheat while being charged and explode in an intensely hot fire. The e-bike shop had been cited previously for safety violations regarding battery storage and charge, media outlets reported. Three pieces of legislation would change the laws around the sales of batteries, chargers and power cords. One bill would prohibit the sale of batteries or chargers that aren’t certified safe by an accredited testing lab. Another requires chargers to have affixed tags providing information about safe use and storage and bright red labels suggesting power cords be unplugged when not in use. “The majority of these fires are being caused by faulty batteries manufactured by companies who have no concern for the possible danger they are causing,” Assemb. Jeffrey Dinowitz (D-Bronx) said when the Assembly approved the bill. Another requires the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to create a lithium-ion battery rebate to encourage people to trade in old batteries for new officially certified ones. Anecdotally, users have said the high cost of new batteries ($500 to $800) makes it more attractive to buy refurbished ones. “Many of these faulty, dangerous batteries have already been sold and are in homes across the state,” Assemb. Yudelka Tapia (D-Bronx) said. “By instituting a trade-in option, we’re giving all residents the ability to keep their families safe from these faulty devices.\" Not everyone is convinced a rebate program will have much impact. State Sen. George Borrello, a Chautauqua County Republican, said the bill would create a “cottage industry” where some people buy new batteries and get the rebate, but then keep old batteries, resell them and pocket the cash. But it’s important to note the bill orders NYSERDA to come up with the rules and regulations for the rebate program, including setting prices and requirements, which could involve trade-ins. One bill would expand the hazardous materials training administered by the state Office of Fire Prevention and Control to include protocols and guidance for responding to emergencies involving lithium-ion batteries. Assemb. Al Taylor (D-Manhattan) said training is needed because “our firefighters are quickly learning that fires caused by lithium-ion batteries require a specialized response.” Not all the lithium-ion proposals floated in Albany garnered enough support to pass both houses in the Legislature. One bill would mandate retailers keep firefighting or fire suppression systems on site, such as certain types of extinguishers or a sprinkler system. Republicans said sprinklers wouldn’t be strong enough to douse e-bike fires, and suppression systems, such as a restaurant might have, would be too expensive for small retailers. Another stalled bill would make the state conduct a lithium-ion battery fire prevention study. Three lithium-battery storage sites in New York State caught fire in 2023. A study by the Hochul administration said “no harmful toxins” were detected at the sites. That hasn’t satisfied some activists who have called for more research on the facilities — which are projected to sprout exponentially as the state tries to transition away from fossil fuels for its energy needs. A task force of state agencies put forth a series of safety recommendations for the storage sites. Meanwhile, the Legislature hasn’t tackled the issue in a broad way. Several lawmakers have proposed bills that would outlaw storage sites in their home districts, but these measures haven’t gained any traction.",

        "content": "When I was 13, my favourite teacher decided that it would be a good idea to call me “Julia Peculiar” in front of the entire class. Whereas a normal kid might have resented being called a little weirdo so publicly, my pubescent heart inflated so much in that moment that it could have dislodged a lung. It was a risky move, but this lady knew what she was doing. She saw that I was an awkward kid who couldn’t throw and catch balls, and had calamitously messy hair resembling the base of a leek. Julia Pound says autism has reached saturation point in popular culture. She also knew that a public acknowledgement of my “not for everyone” status was exactly what I needed at that moment in my life. This nickname was my emotional-support catchphrase for many years; if ever I misunderstood the punchline of a joke, or tried to hide behind a large pot plant while a group photo was being taken, I would wash the shame away by saying to myself, “It’s OK – I’m Julia Peculiar!” Fast-forward a few decades, and my emotional support catchphrase was replaced with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). After three one-hour sessions with a psychologist who depleted my life force and discretionary spending budget for the month, she concluded, “Well you definitely have it”, to which (because I’m Julia Peculiar) I inquired, “Have what?” “Autism,” she replied, very slowly, as if addressing someone who’d just woken up from a lobotomy. In recent years, autism has reached saturation point in popular culture: programs such as Love on the Spectrum feature autistic people being endearingly awkward in a variety of settings, and TikTok is overrun with “You might be autistic if ...” videos made for audiences with the attention span of gnats. Chris Lilley ’s mean-girl character Ja’mie revealed on a recent episode of her podcast that she, somewhat bafflingly to autistic people, was “on the spectrum”. It’s almost as if autism has become at worst a punchline, at best a little bit cute. I wouldn’t mind being cutely autistic – it sounds like a blast. Chris Lilley character Ja’mie said she was “on the spectrum” in a recent podcast.",

It is being overseen by two new advisory committees made up of relevant industry professionals and intends to celebrate creativity and new forms of storytelling, including other sectors such as digital and podcasting. As part of the Frontiers strand Will.I.Am, the multi-platinum music artist, TV producer and tech entrepreneur, will be in conversation with a professor of media and AI, Dr Alex Connock. Former network chief Littlefield will also be in conversation, discussing his time as both a commissioner and producer, while Wilman, who has also produced “The Grand Tour” and “Top Gear,” will be interviewed by Nutopia CEO and Founder, Jane Root, discussing topics including talent wrangling and creativity. The Edinburgh TV Festival is set to take place in Scotland from Aug. 20 to 23.",

Burnley...The post Exclusive: Leeds United star targeted for summer move by Vincent Kompany's Bayern Munich after play-off heartbreak appeared first on HITC.",
        "content": "boss is closing in on a sensational move to following the German side parting ways with former boss With the appointment of Kompany, who took Burnley back into the Premier League from the Championship, it seems as though the German giants are keen on raiding one side from the second tier this summer. suffered a heartbreaking 1-0 defeat to in the play-off final and failed to make an immediate return back to the Premier League. As a result, the future of midfielder has been called into question. Gray attracting Bayern interest It is our understanding that Bayern are ready to test the resolve of the Yorkshire club about keeping hold of the talented midfielder this summer, who has made a big impact at Elland Road. that the German giants were already keeping close tabs on Gray, who is considered one of the best young prospects in English football. Last weekend’s defeat to Southampton in the play-off final could be a costly one with a number of their key players being targeted for a move this summer. Gray committed his future to Leeds last summer with a new and improved contract but, despite this, interest from at home and abroad is understood to remain high. Premier League teams keen It is not just Bayern who are understood to be keen on the talented teenage midfielder but HITC can reveal that , , and Mikel Arteta’s are also keen. A move to United may well be the least likely of these outcomes with the rivalry between the Yorkshire club and the Manchester club, meaning that a move to Old Trafford would be complicated. Arsenal could well be in the market for a new midfielder with the future of Ghanaian unclear but nevertheless a move away from Leeds for the Englishman looks to be on the cards.",

The Wilfred Agar plaque at the University of Melbourne.

As part of his racist science, Agar championed the sterilisation of races “unfit” to breed under a white Australia. His story and many others are included in a new 500-page history of the university that attempts to reckon with controversial links to its racist past and reveals more needs to be done by the institution, which once used Aboriginal bodies obtained by grave robbers on an “industrial scale”. The book, Dhoombak Goobgoowana: A History of Indigenous Australia and the University of Melbourne , includes details of the university’s colonial and eugenic history, and its complicity in scientific racism. Dr James Waghorne (left), Dr Ross Jones and Professor Marcia Langton co-edited the new book looking at the University of Melbourne’s complicity in scientific racism. Credit: Justin McManus Dhoombak Goobgoowana means “truth-telling” in the language of the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung people. Co-editor Professor Marcia Langton says in the book that merely removing names from buildings and not explaining why – as the university did in 2017 with Indigenous-corpse-collecting professor Richard Berry – compounded injustices.",

        "description": "The RBC Canadian Open has produced a string of popular champions since 2018.",
        "content": "With due respect to Chez Reavie, Nathan Green, Carl Pettersson and Scott Piercy, recent years have been kinder to the when it comes to the winner’s circle. Reavie, Green, Pettersson and Piercy won the event in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2012, respectively. Sean O’Hair claimed the title in 2011 and while he had some name recognition as a multi-time tour winner and a 2009 participant, he was by no means a star. Those were the first five years of and at the time it seemed the bank couldn’t catch a break. Consider that Reavie upset hotshot Anthony Kim in that Sunday final pairing; Green beat two-time U.S. Open winner Retief Goosen in a playoff; Pettersson finished two ahead of Luke Donald, an RBC guy and a top-10 player in the world; and O’Hair won to little fanfare because Adam Hadwin, then a 23-year-old Canadian Tour player who grew up in nearby Abbotsford, B.C., was the bigger story with his tie for fourth after holding the final-round lead. Fortunes turned when Brandt Snedeker was victorious in 2013. Snedeker had joined Team RBC that January and was the reigning FedEx Cup champion. South African Tim Clark was a fine winner in 2014 (except that he beat two-time Canadian Open champion Jim Furyk) but not as good as tournament favourite Jason Day in 2015. Back-to-back victories by Jhonattan Vegas followed. Like Clark, Vegas was an affable champion but not as sexy of a name as those he beat — Dustin Johnson and new pro Jon Rahm in 2016; Ian Poulter in 2017. Since 2018, however, the Canadian Open has delivered perhaps the best possible winner four years running. That year Johnson, the world’s best player and the face of Team RBC, won at Glen Abbey. He was followed by Rory McIlroy at Hamilton Golf and Country Club. In his first tournament appearance, McIlroy was treated like a rock star , flirting with a 59 on Sunday. After COVID cancelled the 2020 and 2021 tournaments, McIlroy by fending off fellow stars Tony Finau and Justin Thomas on a wild Sunday at St. George’s. Then last year at Oakdale, . His playoff win over Tommy Fleetwood was the country’s sporting moment of the year. Can Taylor’s win be topped? No, not since he will always be the man who ended a nearly seven-decade drought and did so in such dramatic fashion. But there are some obvious candidates in the field this week at Hamilton who could continue the RBC Canadian Open’s string of memorable champions. Here are our five best-case winners this week. Mackenzie Hughes’ first PGA Tour start came as an amateur at the RBC Canadian Open at Hamilton in 2012. Insert any Canadian’s name here, but Hughes gets the nod over his PGA Tour peers . The two-time tour winner grew up in nearby Dundas and spent many days practising at Hamilton while working with his childhood coach, Scott Cowx, the club’s past director of instruction. Hughes’ first PGA Tour start was as an amateur at Hamilton in 2012 and although he missed the cut, he accorded himself well with two rounds of 71. Hughes tied for 14th when the tournament was played there in 2019. He enters the tournament off a missed cut in the PGA Championship, but he tied for sixth at the Wells Fargo Championship the previous week. Rory McIlroy is a two-time winner of the RBC Canadian Open. McIlroy returns to the course where he won his first RBC Canadian Open. That Open was the first one played during its new June slot and the date change produced record crowds and concession sales. With the Toronto Raptors in the NBA Finals then, fans were in a particularly festive mood and McIlroy soaked up his time in the spotlight. during the trophy ceremony. The Northern Irishman is the biggest draw at Hamilton by far and a third Canadian Open win would be welcomed by all. Tommy Fleetwood would be a popular champion if he were to win the RBC Canadian Open this weekend. Somewhat lost amid the hysteria of Taylor’s momentous victory at Oakdale last year was Fleetwood’s heartbreaking defeat. The Englishman could have won the tournament with a birdie on the par-5 18th hole in regulation but erred when he laid his second shot up into the course’s heavy rough. Though he has seven DP World Tour victories, including January’s Dubai Invitational, Fleetwood still has not broken through on the PGA Tour. A fan favourite, Fleetwood is among the game’s nicest men and would be a popular champion should he hoist the RBC Canadian Open trophy come Sunday. Adam Scott is back playing the RBC Canadian Open for the first time in 21 years. Scott is a surprising entry this week. The popular Aussie has played the tournament only once — 21 years ago at Hamilton when the course hosted the championship for the first time in the modern era. He tied for 32nd that week. While he is no longer one of the world’s best players, Scott will be a top draw given his profile and long absence from Canada. The 2013 Masters champion — who is likely to be in Montreal for the Presidents Cup, at least as one of — is 64th in the FedEx Cup rankings and has five top-20 finishes on the season. He tied for 12th last week. Affable Irishman Shane Lowry tied for second at the RBC Canadian Open in 2019 and has been a tournament mainstay since 2017. If not McIlroy, how about his good mate Shane Lowry? The affable Irishman has been a tournament mainstay since 2017 and in 2019 he tied for second behind McIlroy at Hamilton. Six weeks later, he won the Open Championship at Northern Ireland’s Royal Portrush, so he’s got good feels for Hamilton. Though he doesn’t have an RBC shield on his shirt, it was Lowry who talked some players out of a boycott last year at Oakdale after the PGA Tour-PIF bombshell.

        "content": "The Florida Panthers promised tonight would be one of those fasten-your-seatbelt playoff games when they look to level their Eastern Conference final series at two games apiece. If the Rangers win they’ll be up 3-1 and in the driver’s seat heading back to Madison Square Garden. And in Edmonton, the Oilers will have a day to figure out how they blew a tire after a fast start against the Stars last night, before trying to tie their West final series at 2-2 tomorrow. Here are five things to know about the NHL playoffs: COMEBACK OR COLLAPSE? Great comeback or a big collapse? That was the question after Edmonton blew a 2-0 lead and lost 5-3 to the visiting Dallas Stars last night. Oilers captain Connor McDavid, who had a goal and assist in the first period at Rogers Place, figured it may have been a bit of both. “They went up a couple levels and we went down a few levels,” McDavid said. “You see the difference.” The Oilers outshot the Stars 10-3 in the first, outscored, outhit, outhustled and outskated the visitors and led 2-0. Then, the Oilers took their foot off the gas and the Stars, led by Jason Robertson, dominated the second period, outshooting the Oilers 16-7, outscoring them 3-1 and outhustling them for loose pucks. The Oilers have seen this movie before. They blew a late 4-2 lead in Game 1 against the Vancouver Canucks and lost 5-4. The Oilers led Game 7 against the Canucks 3-0 and then desperately scrambled to hang on for a series-clinching 3-2 win. McDavid and defenceman Darnell Nurse said 50-minute efforts don’t cut it in the post-season. Both promised to be better in Game 4. REPLACEMENTS PLAY BIG ROLE The Replacements, a 2000 sports comedy starring Canadian Keanu Reaves, poked fun at missing players during the 1987 NFL strike. The Replacements 2.0, a true 2024 sports “drama” starring the Oilers’ Adam Henrique and the Stars’ Roope Hintz, is a real story about the value of injecting skilled players back into the Edmonton-Dallas NHL playoff series. Hintz, who played his first game last night since suffering an upper-body injury in Game 4 of the second-round series against the Colorado Avalanche, assisted on both Jason Robertson goals in the second period. Henrique, who injured his ankle in Game 5 of the opening round against the Los Angeles Kings, scored the Oilers’ third goal in the second period which tied the game 3-3 heading into the intermission. SEGUIN MARKS MILESTONE WITH KEY ASSISTS Tyler Seguin played his 130th playoff game last night and the Stars’ forward did more than just show up. The 32-year-old Seguin, of Brampton, Ont., assisted on Robertson’s first goal in the second period and then set up Robertson’s winning goal in the third period. TROUBA HIT WITH ELBOWING FINE New York Rangers’ defenceman and captain Jacob Trouba was fined $5,000 yesterday for Sunday’s second-period elbowing infraction that levelled Evan Rodrigues of the Florida Panthers. Trouba, now the No. 1 villain in Florida, makes $8 million a year, so the fine is easier to take than a suspension. In fact, Panthers’ bench boss Paul Maurice — who coached Trouba in Winnipeg — mocked the paltry fine, suggesting reporters pass the hat around so Jake will be able to eat after making the payment. Trouba said the controversial hit “just happened fast” and insisted he wasn’t targeting Rodrigues’ head. In fact, one New York beat reporter asked the hard-nosed defenceman if the Panthers are guilty of embellishment. Expect the hitting to get cranked up another notch on Tuesday when the host Panthers aim to level the best-of-seven Eastern Conference final at two games apiece. COMEBACK RANGERS IN RECORD BOOKS The Rangers established an NHL record for most comeback victories in the regular season and playoffs combined as they earned their 34th of 2023-24 with Sunday’s 5-4 overtime victory in Florida. The Blueshirts also matched their franchise record for most overtime wins in a post-season with four. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 28, 2024.",

        "content": "A campaign to raise £300k for essential mountain path repairs has achieved 73% of its funding target in its first 12 months. Mountaineering Scotland and the Outdoor Access Trust for Scotland (OATS) launched 'It's Up To Us' in 2023 for the upkeep of walkways on the nation's peaks, with the initial phase focused on repairing 3.2km of badly eroded path on An Teallach. In the year since £218k has been raised, and contractors from Cairngorm Wilderness Contracts (CWC) have so far completed 340m of path building and maintenance work on the mountain. The three-year campaign has received donations from the Scottish Mountaineering Trust, European Outdoor Conservation Association (EOCA), and other charitable trusts (£154,858), a major private donor (£25,000), the general public (£24,996), commercial donations (£7,550) and mountaineering and hillwalking clubs (£5,900). As the campaign enters its second year, Mountaineering Scotland and OATS are issuing a further appeal to all hill path users, outdoor and conservation businesses, organisations, and charities who care deeply about the conservation of the hills they use and love to support the campaign and help them reach the £300,000 required to complete the An Teallach project. The campaign is also calling on government to help develop a sustainable funding model for building and maintenance work across Scotland’s upland path network to ensure it is kept fit for purpose for future generations. Walking tourism is estimated to be worth around 1.6 billion per year to the Scottish economy . However, there is no government funding for path work on privately owned land, 83% of paths in Scotland, that is not in the two national parks or NGO estates. Post-Brexit, EU funding that was previously accessible to private landowners has been lost and not replaced. CEO of the Outdoor Access Trust Scotland CEO, Dougie Baird, said: “It has been an encouraging start to the It's Up To Us fundraising campaign, with a great response from charitable trusts in particular. \"We are hugely grateful for all our individual public donors and will be encouraging other hill users to follow their fine example in the coming year to help fix the badly eroded path on this iconic mountain.” Mountaineering Scotland CEO, Stuart Younie, said: “It’s been great to see the progress we have made over the last year since launching It’s Up to Us. Many thanks to all the people and organisations who have either contributed financially, helped us to raise the profile of the campaign or volunteered to repair the path on An Teallach. “We are very grateful for all the support we have received and are well on our way to reaching our target but there is still a lot more to do to deliver our ambition of establishing a sustainable funding model to support the maintenance and upkeep of our mountain paths. An Teallach is one of many mountains in Scotland that needs our support and it’s up to all of us to do something about it.”",

        "content": "Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump says he will seriously consider pardoning Julian Assange for espionage charges if he wins the November presidential election. Trump’s comments show a growing bipartisan willingness in the US to let Assange walk free after President Joe Biden said he was considering the Australian government’s request to drop the pursuit of Assange. The WikiLeaks founder is fighting extradition to the US, where he faces espionage charges carrying a maximum 175-year sentence for obtaining and publishing classified information under an indictment issued by the Trump administration in 2019. Former President Donald Trump said he would give serious consideration to pardoning Assange. Credit: POOL EPA Asked in an interview with American conservative podcaster Timothy Pool whether he would grant Assange a pardon if he came to office, Trump said: “Well I’m going to talk about that today, and we’re going to give it very serious consideration.” Trump was speaking ahead of an address to the Libertarian National Convention, where he did not raise the Assange case in his speech. Assange’s brother Gabriel Shipton welcomed Trump’s comments, saying: “I think we are reaching a critical point in the fight to free Julian. All presidential candidates have made statements on Julian’s freedom in the past two months.” Shipton continued: “It’s time this scandalous prosecution is brought to an end and, with the help of the Australian government, Julian is brought home to be with his family.” Earlier this month a British court granted Assange, 52, permission to appeal against an order that he be extradited to the US.

Jet2 , which flies from Birmingham Airport and is rivalled by the likes of TUI, Ryanair , Easyjet and more, warned British tourists that they could face flight delays due to strike action in France which includes air traffic control workers. Jet2 said: “We wanted to let you know about strike action, supported by French Air Traffic Control on May 24 to May 30 2024, which may cause delays to flights travelling through French airspace. Rest assured, we’ll try to keep any disruption to a minimum. Check-in will close 40 minutes before your scheduled departure so please arrive at the airport at least two hours before departure.\" EasyJet said: “We’ve been made aware of air traffic control strikes that will affect flights in and out of France from Friday 24th to Friday 31st May. We expect there will be disruption and delays as a result to the industrial action, so we advise all customers to continue to check the status of their flight on Flight Tracker before travelling to the airport. READ MORE Brits in Spain and Portugal told to prepare for 'dramatic' shift starting today “Although this is outside of our control, we wish to reassure you that we are doing all we can to minimise any disruption to our flights that may occur as a result of the strike action.” The government in France condemned the strike. \"I deplore the behavior of some local level agents who refuse to recognise the legitimacy of a majority accord and are making passengers pay the price,\" deputy transport minister Patrice Vergriete told AFP. The strike comes as France's second busiest airport prepares for a massive influx for the Paris Olympics, that start 26 July. It is the second major air traffic controllers strike in a month. The last one caused the cancellation of thousands of flights across Europe.",

        "content": "As I travelled through Uttar Pradesh, the country’s most populous State, touching 16 of its 80 parliamentary constituencies, spanning the distance from Muzaffarnagar in the west to Mau in the east, what was immediately apparent was an absence of billboards, bunting, or even party flags, part of the landscape of any election. There was no sign of a wave, much less the excited anticipation that should precede a change of government—or an endorsement of the previous dispensation. “ [the voter is silent)]” was the refrain everywhere. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decade in power has been marked by demonetisation (2016), the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax Act (2017), the COVID pandemic (2020-23), and two farmers’ agitations (2020-21 and 2024), a result of the crisis in the sector—in Uttar Pradesh, 59.3 per cent of the population is engaged in agriculture. Together, these have not just destroyed jobs but also the hope of a better life. The promised “Modi ki guarantee”, even the BJP’s top brass has realised, is not resonating with the people as much as it should. There is a change in the tone, tenor, and content of their speeches, from a listing of the government’s achievements to harangues dominated by divisive issues. The gleaming expressways, emblems of the “Shining India” that Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s generation of the BJP had dreamt up, have grown, linking the furthest corners of Uttar Pradesh. But a vast majority of the villages still do not have decent roads: in many cases, they cannot even boast of a brick pathway) or drains. The (beneficiary)—a class of people created by the BJP to be the recipient of free rations, the Kisan Samman Nidhi, free homes, toilets, gas connections, and water at the doorstep—is no longer as grateful. Corruption and poor administration at the local level is at an all-time high. Take the free rations: in many cases, the recipients get less than they should, with the siphoning off as much as 2 kg out of the promised 5 kg a person; toilets depend not just on the availability of materials to build them but the munificence of the village pradhan; as for water at the doorstep, pipes have been laid but nothing gushes through them yet in many cases even though several months have rolled by. The gas cylinders came free, but the cost of refilling them is prohibitive. In Jaraud, a large and prosperous village in Muzaffarnagar, set amidst sugarcane fields, Madan Pal, a wealthy Jat farmer tells me he spent Rs.1 lakh to buy a new transformer to drive the tube wells, as the old one had been lying unrepaired for several months, thanks to an indifferent administration. “I know they won’t repay me,” Pal says, “but without the transformer, what would have happened to our crop?” In a sleepy village in Lalganj, a retired Brahmin jawan points to a pipe peeping out through a mound of mud in front of his home: “It is more than six months since the government laid that pipe but there is no water yet.” In Johrasharqi, a village in Rae Bareli, a Vishwakarma couple say that the pradhan favours only privileged castes and so they are yet to get a toilet. As for police stations, Bharat Singh, a young Rajput in Indara village in Mau, says: “Go to a police station as an ‘unknown’”—he uses the English word “unknown” to denote a lack of connections—and [no one will give you a hearing]”. In 2022, the last Assembly election, I heard very few people say that they would prefer jobs to free rations. This time, I hear it in every village I visit: the older members want their children to be employed fruitfully; the young, simply, aspire to a better life. Most people would prefer a government job, but they are also aware that these are scarce and want to know why the government cannot help create more jobs in the private sector. “What prevents the government from giving incentives to the MSMEs [micro, small, and medium Enterprises] to open units in the rural areas or in cities close to the villages?” a young government schoolteacher in Sitapur asks, adding, “People here would be able to commute to work and return to their villages in the evening. They would be close to their families; they would save the money they spend on renting a room in the city.” Indeed, as more people get educated, the lack of commensurate employment opportunities, compounded by rising prices, is creating a social crisis. Many educated young men, frustrated at a lack of prospects, spend their time getting drunk or, worse, joining the rank and file of militias run by local strongmen. Some help on the family land or take up menial tasks; some leave their homes for distant destinations like Nashik, Surat, Bengaluru, or Mumbai in search of more substantial employment. Many live in appalling conditions in those cities, but they all send home money. And it is not just the men who want jobs; Manju, a young married woman who lives in Ramnagar, a village in Jaunpur, and has passed her Intermediate examinations, asks me: “Is my life going to be limited to looking after the kids, cooking, and helping on the farm?” What would she do, if she had an option? “I have been to a tailoring school, so if there was a tailoring unit here, I could work there and contribute to the family,” she answers. In Johrasharqi, an 18-year-old Yadav boy, whose parents could not afford to educate him beyond class IX, has returned from Surat to cast his vote. He has been working in a dyeing unit in that city for a year, thanks to his brother-in-law being the supervisor there. In Varanasi, Modi’s constituency, famous for its silk saris—part of every north Indian bride’s trousseau—and carpets, some of the traders and weavers, especially among Muslims, have begun to shift base to Benguluru and Surat. The Union government’s Agnipath scheme comes in for universal criticism, especially from those usually described as the martial castes, such as Jats and Rajputs. “It lasts only for four years and there is no guarantee of a job after that. What will happen then?” asks a Jat farmer in Jarauda, adding, “Many young men, trained in the use of arms, will be disgorged into society—with no hope of a decent job; they will all become goondas.” Dayanand Dubey, a retired jawan who lives near Phaphamau, on the outskirts of Prayagraj, and who saw action in Kargil, also criticises the scheme. At Fatehpur in Aligarh district, Kapil Baliyan, who is idling in a friend’s grocery shop, is also against the scheme. “My forefathers were all in the army, but now I can’t get in. This Agnipath is useless. I am thinking of voting NOTA,” he says. He is 18, has just passed his Class XII examination but is forced to work at the family-owned eatery, “Chowdhury Hotel”, that stands at the entrance to the village. His brothers Yogesh and Sonu are “Inter-pass”: one minds the buffaloes and other animals on their farm; the other the crops. For every villager content with government handouts, there is another who says that they would be happier if the government took measures to create jobs and stopped handing out rations. Many even say that they did not like being called ; it hurts their pride. Among Dalits and sections of the lower OBCs, there is fear that if the BJP really gets 400-plus seats, a number on which the party’s leadership has set its sights, then it will amend the Constitution and end reservation. Indeed, the word has spread so far that RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat was forced recently to say that the RSS had always supported reservation as guaranteed and sanctioned under the Constitution. Union Home Minister Amit Shah, addressing a press conference on April 30 in Guwahati, was also compelled to say: “I want to make one thing clear: BJP supports reservation for SCs, STs, and OBCs and will always play its role as its protector.” At an election rally attended by Narendra Modi in Prayagraj on May 21.| Photo Credit:NIHARIKA KULKARNI/AFP Given that all these issues figure in the INDIA bloc’s campaign, the opposition clearly has had some success in making them into talking points at the village level, acknowledges Anupam Mishra, editor of , in Allahabad. And yet, despite the litany of complaints, there is a belief that it is difficult to oust the BJP, and it is not only because people have little faith in the opposition putting up an effective fight against the BJP. Across Uttar Pradesh—and without any question from this reporter—a subject that came up constantly was that of “button ki jeet”, scepticism about the reliability of EVMs: “ [As long as there are EVM machines, Modi will return to power. Bring back the ballot paper]”; that was a near universal refrain. (Even as I write this, news comes from Lakhimpur Kheri, whose residents cast their votes in the third round, that voters here have alleged rigging during the election, claiming that despite pressing the cycle [Samajwadi Party (SP) symbol] button, the EVM showed a lotus [BJP symbol]. People accused the presiding officer, Prashant Kumar, of tampering with the voting process.) Interestingly, this lack of trust in the sanctity of the voting process came from across the caste spectrum and the gender and age divide, and this is even though the Supreme Court has upheld the present system. Asked why they had not taken to the streets if they felt so strongly, the answer was always the same: “And risk being thrown into jail?” There is a clear belief that the era of peaceful protests is over. This, however, has not stopped Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s caste fellows, the Rajputs, traditional BJP supporters, from staging a series of well-attended caste panchayats in western Uttar Pradesh in Saharanpur, Ghaziabad (Dhalauna), Meerut (Sardhana), and Aligarh (Umari) and denouncing the party for fielding only one Thakur candidate in the region, in Moradabad. They were hoping to see their caste fellows named in Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Meerut, Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Kairana, and Bijnor. As the third largest community in western Uttar Pradesh after Jatavs (an SC community that owes allegiance to Bahujan Samaj Party [BSP] leader Mayawati) and Muslims, their anger could adversely affect election results for the BJP in this part of the State. In their speeches, community leaders denounced the party’s top brass for not selecting enough Rajput candidates and urged their caste fellows not to vote the BJP. This sense of “neglect” had other triggers too: Parshottam Rupala, Union Agriculture Minister, had said in a public speech that the Rajputs had a relationship with the British (breaking bread and entering into marital relations), and former Union Minister Mahesh Sharma had, according to them, openly supported “history distortion” by opening a museum dedicated to Samrat Mihir Bhoj and describing him as belonging to the Gujjar community. (According to Rajputs, all kings are Rajputs.) What is interesting is that while Modi, Amit Shah, and even Adityanath visited the area to calm down the agitating Rajputs, none of it worked. The Election Commission, too, took no notice of these caste gatherings forbidden during the election period. The word in the villages, at mofussil tea shops and district courts is that Modi and Shah have plans to replace Adityanath with an OBC Chief Minister after the election. Many Rajputs explained to me that the community therefore wishes to keep the numbers down so that Modi will not be able to make any change and will have to depend on Adityanath for a while longer. Caste, therefore, has made a comeback, with the Rajput community up in arms, both because it fears that its power in the community is diminishing, thanks to the BJP leadership’s steady wooing of the OBCs, witnessed this time in the party’s allies, as well as statements made by senior BJP leaders that it finds offensive. The Brahmins, too, while well represented in government, fear that the backward castes, whom Modi and the BJP have been espousing, will gradually dominate State politics: whether this will translate into a shrinking of votes for the party was, however, not clear. The question, therefore, is, given the list of complaints against the government, and the growing disquiet among the privileged castes, will the BJP’s numbers shrink? Especially as there is no overt Hindu-Muslim tension in Uttar Pradesh, and it is caste, seemingly, that has the upper hand. Let us look at the last election to answer that. In 2019, the BJP, in an alliance with the Apna Dal-Soneylal, or AD(S), secured 49.98 per cent of the votes and won 62 seats, while the AD(S) with 1.21 per cent, managed 2. The SP fought in alliance with the BSP and the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), and the Mahagathbandhan won 15 seats; the BSP managed 10 (19.43 per cent vote share), the SP 5 (18.11 per cent), and the RLD none (1.69 per cent). The Congress, with 6.36 per cent of the votes, won just one seat. This time, the BJP’s allies include not just the AD(S), but also the RLD, the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, and the NISHAD (Nirbal Indian Shoshit Hamara Aam Dal) Party, representing a range of OBCs. So it begins with a broader base. The SP and the Congress have joined hands, while the BSP is contesting on its own, which means it is a much weaker configuration than the opposition alliance of 2019. People were quick to list their complaints against the BJP, but did that mean the party and its allies would lose many seats? Their cryptic reply was: “There is no real opposition, it is very weak.” The Yadav-dominated SP still suffers from an image problem: the non-Yadavs have successfully demonised it as a party of hoodlums. The SP has sought to compensate for this and for its lost allies by making fewer of its core supporters—Yadavs and Muslims—candidates and reserving the biggest chunk of nominations for the other OBCs and SCs. The BSP, thanks to the fear about proposed changes to the Constitution, may get more votes this time, but it is contesting alone. Party sources say it is being “blackmailed” by the BJP: in Jaunpur, when the BSP fielded local Robin Hood Dhananjay Singh’s wife, people told this correspondent that she was sure to win for two reasons: one, Dhananjay was very popular, and there was anger that he had been jailed (he has been released since), and two, since the BJP candidate, Kripa Shankar Singh—though originally from Jaunpur—had spent his entire political career until recently in the Congress in Maharashtra, people did not regard him with favour. The BJP has since “compelled” the BSP to change its candidate, and Kripa Shankar Singh is now seen as the front runner. A similar story has emerged from the Basti parliamentary constituency. As for the Congress, Rahul Gandhi’s Nyay Yatra that passed through the State recently made a positive impact. The party’s manifesto is being echoed in villages, and the fact that Rahul is contesting from Rae Bareli are all seen as pluses. But the party leadership has failed to lead from the front and present a united opposition front countrywide. If these factors point to the difficulties faced by the opposition, another is the state of Hindu-Muslim relations. In western Uttar Pradesh, the fires of the Muzaffarnagar riots may have died out, and people may not be very excited at the consecration of the Ram temple. As you move eastwards, the temple gets more traction but not necessarily universal traction among all Hindus. But one question elicits an answer that tells you that anti-Muslim sentiments are well and truly embedded. Among non-Muslims, across caste lines, there is widespread approbation for Adityanath’s bulldozer politics, which is shorthand for the custodial deaths of Atiq Ahmed and Mukthar Ansari, the two dons of eastern Uttar Pradesh, and the bulldozing of Muslim homes. Forget the villages, even at the Allahabad High Court, and later at the Azamgarh district court, privileged-caste lawyers are gleeful about the use of bulldozers to “teach the Muslims a lesson, to show them their place”. When I point out that surely as people who believe in the rule of law, they cannot approve of it, they say: “Cases keep piling up in court. They take years to dispose of. This was the only way to show Muslims their place.” Indeed, the construction of the Ram temple gets less traction than bulldozer politics. In Varanasi, meanwhile, Hindu idols have suddenly found their way into a cellar at the Gyanvapi Mosque, where once logs of wood were stored. People here are awaiting its demolition. A lawyer at the Allahabad High Court tells me: “The Babri Masjid was pulled down by the people. The Gyanvapi Mosque will be pulled down through a court order.” When I tell him that there is a law that says that barring the Babri Masjid/Ram temple, all other places of worship are to remain the way they were in 1947, he shrugs his shoulders. “Who cares about that?” Indeed, the Varanasi Commissioner, Kaushal Raj Sharma, an IAS officer, along with his young son, have attended prayers in the cellar, giving an “official” stamp of approval to something that is patently unlawful but now has the sanction of the courts.

Across the State, their first preference is the SP-Congress; in places where the BSP candidate is stronger, they may vote for the party. So, what are the Muslims doing? The Mufti of Banaras, Abdul Bateen, says that the word to the community is to keep their heads down and vote intelligently. In the well-known Shibli College in Azamgarh, the Principal, Dr Afsar Ali, tells me that 65 per cent of his students are girls and that many of the boys—after completing their degree—are opting for professional courses, such as in management, rather than doing their MA: “When the BJP came to power in 2014, young Muslims were terrified and indecisive about what to do. After a few years of indecision, they are now studying in increased numbers.” When he says that, I recall what Neeraj Sharma, a Brahmin in Muzaffarnagar’s Jaraud, told me while summing up the election this time: “In the last couple of elections, we voted as Hindus; now that communal frenzy has died down and caste is the most important factor. My community, originally with the Congress, shifted to the BJP, but this time their votes will be split between the BJP and the [Congress-SP] candidate.” Then he laments, “Once upon a time, Muslims were [hardliners]. Yesterday, I was looking at the UPSC results and saw that many Muslims have got into the civil service. Now, Hindus have become hardliners, like Muslims of the past. If farming collapses, and the government does not create jobs, what will happen to our children?” COMMents",

        "content": "Vinayak Damodar Savarkar , also referred to as Veer Savarkar, was a revolutionary leader. He was also a social reformer and a writer. Savarkar was sentenced to life imprisonment and sent to Port Blair Cellular jail (Kala Paani) in Andaman. Savarkar was born to Damodar and Radhabai Savarkar on May 28, 1883, in Maharashtra’s Nashik. Savarkar passed away on February 26, 1966. Last year, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde declared that May 28 will be celebrated as ‘Swatantrya Veer Gaurav Din’. On his birth anniversary, here’s a look at some little-known facts about the great leader. Veer Savarkar Birth Anniversary 2024: Lesser-known Facts 1.At the age of 16, Savarkar formed the Mitra Mela. The only aim of this group was to attain freedom for the nation. It was formed in 1899. Later, Mitra Mela was known as Abhinava Bharat. 2.Did you know Vinayak Damodar Savarkar was among the first few revolutionaries who understood the importance of having international support for attaining independence? 3.He was arrested by British officers in 1910 and sent to jail at the age of 27. During his time there, Savarkar wrote a book titled — Essentials of Hindutva. As per Britannica, the epigraph of his book defines the concept as “A HINDU means a person who regards this land of BHARATVARSHA, from the Indus to the Seas as his Father-Land as well as his Holy-Land that is the cradle land of his religion.” 4.Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, in 1937, was picked as the president of Hindu Mahasabha. He held the position for five years. Vinayak Damodar Savarkar’s Quotes 1.“We yield to none in our love, admiration, and respect for the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. They are all ours. Their glories are ours, and ours are their failures.” 2.“One country, one God, one caste, one mind brothers all of us without difference, without doubt.” 3.“Calmness in preparation but boldness in execution, this should be the watchword during moments of crisis.” 4.“The nation that has no consciousness of its past has no future.” 5.“Every person is a Hindu who regards and owns this Bharat Bhumi, this land from the Indus to the seas, as his Fatherland as well as Holyland, that is, the land of the origin of his religion.” 6.The practice of untouchability is a sin, a blot on humanity, and nothing can justify it.”",

        "content": "Spain, Ireland and Norway are formally recognising a Palestinian state on Tuesday in a decision slammed by Israel as a \"reward\" for Hamas more than seven months into the devastating Gaza war. The three European countries believe their initiative has strong symbolic impact, which is likely to encourage others to follow suit. \"Recognition of the State of Palestine is not only a matter of historic justice... It is also an essential requirement if we are all to achieve peace,\" Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said before meeting his cabinet. The move, he said, was \"not against anyone, least of all Israel\". \"It is the only way to move towards the solution that we all recognise as the only possible way to achieve a peaceful future -- that of a Palestinian state living side-by-side with the state of Israel in peace and security.\" Sanchez also said the decision reflected Spain's \"outright rejection of Hamas, which is against the two-state solution\" and whose October 7 attacks led to the Gaza war. The plans were unveiled last week in a coordinated announcement by the prime ministers of the three countries. Both the Spanish and Irish cabinets were meeting to formally approve the step on Tuesday morning, while Norway informed Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Mustafa its recognition would also take effect the same day. Entering the cabinet meeting, Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris said it was \"an important moment\". He said it sent \"a signal to the world is that there are practical actions you can take as a country to help keep the hope... of a two-state solution alive\". - 'Incitement to genocide' - The decision has provoked a furious response from Israel and further exacerbated diplomatic tensions, notably with Spain. Last week, Sanchez's far-left deputy Yolanda Diaz hailed the move saying: \"We cannot stop. Palestine will be free from the river to the sea\", which Israel's Madrid envoy denounced as a \"clear call for the elimination of Israel\". The slogan refers to the British mandate borders of Palestine, which stretched from the River Jordan to the Mediterranean before Israel was created in 1948. On Tuesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz went even further. \"Sanchez, as long as you don't fire your deputy and you recognise a Palestinian state, you are participating in the incitement to commit genocide and war crimes against the Jewish people,\" he wrote on X. On Sunday, Katz posted a video on X splicing footage of the October 7 attacks with flamenco dancing, saying: \"Sanchez: Hamas thanks you for your service\". Spain condemned the post as \"scandalous and revolting\". On Monday, Katz ordered the first of a series of \"preliminary punitive measures\", ordering Spain's Jerusalem consulate to stop offering consular services to Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. - Differences within the EU - Recognising Palestinian statehood has provoked sharp disagreement within the 27-nation European Union. For decades, formal recognition of a Palestinian state has been seen as the endgame of a negotiated peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Washington and most Western European nations have said they are willing to one day recognise Palestinian statehood, but not before agreement on thorny issues like the status of Jerusalem and final borders. The Gaza bloodshed has revived calls for Palestinians to be given their own state. Ever more European countries are expressing a desire to do so, although others remain reticent. France, for example, believes it is not the right time to do so, while Germany only envisages recognition following negotiations between the two sides. Tuesday's move will mean 145 of the United Nations' 193 member states now recognise Palestinian statehood. In 2014, Sweden became the first EU member to recognise a Palestinian state. It followed six other European countries that took the step before joining the bloc -- Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania. On October 7, Hamas fighters stormed into southern Israel in an assault that killed more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza. The Israeli army says 37 of them are dead. Israel's relentless retaliatory offensive has killed more than 36,000 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. burs-hmw/gil",

In a , KWS explained that the successful capture of the dangerous wild animal followed an alarm raised by the National Police Service (NPS). In a well-choreographed operation, KWS officials deployed a special trap which was used to capture the hyena on the loose. \"KWS Nairobi team received an urgent call from the National Police Service 'A' campus in Embakasi. An unexpected visitor had been spotted roaming the grounds: A hyena!,\" KWS statement read in part. \"Our team sprang into action, deploying a specially designed predator trap to safely capture the hyena without causing it any harm. After careful planning and execution, the hyena was successfully captured and ready to be returned to its rightful home,\" the wildlife service added. The hyena was then transported and released at the Nairobi National Park. Following the successful operation, KWS lauded the police and Embakasi citizens for acting promptly to inform them of the pending danger. The KWS team vowed to champion for peaceful coexistence between wildlife and the communities. \"The KWS team safely transported the hyena to Nairobi National Park, where, amid the vast savannah and familiar landscapes it was released back into its natural habitat. \"This successful mission not only highlights the dedication and expertise of our team but also underscores our commitment to peaceful coexistence between wildlife and the communities,\" KWS insisted. However, the wildlife service appealed to the public to promptly reach out to them through their official channels whenever they notice wild animals within their vicinity. \"Remember, if you encounter any wildlife incidences, KWS is just a call away.

        "content": "Spain, Ireland and Norway set to recognise a Palestinian state today as Israeli official slams Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez of being a 'partner to incitement' to Jewish 'genocide' The three European countries believe their initiative has strong symbolic impact But the decision was slammed by outraged Israeli officials and commentators By David Averre Published: 09:52 BST, 28 May 2024 | Updated: 10:18 BST, 28 May 2024 e-mail View comments Spain , Ireland and Norway will formally recognise a Palestinian state today in a decision slammed by Israel as a 'reward' for Hamas more than seven months into the devastating Gaza war. The three European countries believe their initiative has strong symbolic impact, which is likely to encourage others to follow suit, and point to Norway and Spain's historic role in advancing Israel-Palestinian peace efforts. In 1991, the two sides sat down together for the first time at the Madrid peace conference that paved the way for the 1993 Oslo Accords, which at the time were expected to serve as the foundations for a peace process that never materialised. 'Recognition of the State of Palestine is not only a matter of historic justice... Is it also an essential requirement if we are all to achieve peace,' Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said before meeting his cabinet. The move, he said, was 'not against anyone, least of all Israel'. But Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz expressed rage at the decision this morning, accusing Sanchez of being a 'partner to incitement' to Jewish 'genocide'. 'You are a partner to incitement to genocide of the Jewish people', Katz wrote on X, while making a parallel between Spanish minister Yolanda Diaz on the one hand, and Iran 's supreme leader Ali Khamenei and Hamas Gaza chief Yahya Sinwar on the other following her call for a free Palestine, 'from the river to the sea'. A gloating Hamas has hailed Ireland, Norway and Spain 's decision to recognise a Palestinian state as an 'important step' - as Israel lashed out, accusing the European countries of a 'twisted' move that 'rewards terrorism'. Pictured: A map showing which countries recognise the State of Palestine, including the three new countries shown in red Demonstrators hold signs and Palestinian flags, as people call for a ceasefire in Gaza during a rally to commemorate Nakba Day, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, in Madrid, Spain, May 11, 2024 Demonstrators hold a banner, as people call for a ceasefire in Gaza during a rally to commemorate Nakba Day, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, in Madrid, Spain, May 11, 2024. The banner reads: 'Enough of genocide, no more colonialism. Free Palestine.' Israel said it was recalling its envoys to Ireland and Norway for 'urgent consultations' and was expected to do the same with its ambassador to Spain. Pictured: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (file photo) Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said 'recognition of Palestine is a means of supporting the moderate forces which have been losing ground in this protracted and brutal conflict' Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez charged that his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu's campaign of 'pain and destruction' in the Gaza Strip was now putting the two-state solution in 'danger' as he announced Spain would recognise the State of Palestine Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris called the October 7 attack 'barbaric' but added that 'a two-state solution is the only way out of the generational cycles of violence, retaliation and resentment' as Ireland announced it would recognise the State of Palestine Hamas welcomed the decision and urged other countries to follow suit. 'We consider this an important step towards affirming our right to our land,' it said, calling 'on countries around the world to recognise our legitimate national rights'. But Spain's Prime Minister said the decision to recognise a Palestinian state reflected his nation's 'outright rejection of Hamas, which is against the two-state solution' and whose October 7 attacks led to the Gaza war. Read More Benjamin Netanyahu vows to continue war in Gaza after admitting Israeli air strike on Rafah that killed dozens of Palestinians was 'tragic mishap': UN set to hold emergency meeting as outrage grows 'It is the only way to move towards the solution that we all recognise as the only possible way to achieve a peaceful future - that of a Palestinian state living side-by-side with the state of Israel in peace and security .' The plans were unveiled last week in a coordinated announcement by the prime ministers of the three countries. Formal recognition is to take place in all three today. Both the Spanish and Irish cabinets meet to approve the step this morning, while Norway informed Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Mustafa at the weekend its recognition would also take effect on Tuesday. Although Slovenia has also started the process of recognising a Palestinian state, the issue has provoked sharp disagreement within the 27-nation European Union, of which Spain and Ireland are also members. For decades, formal recognition of a Palestinian state has been seen as the endgame of a negotiated peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Washington and most Western European nations have said they are willing to one day recognise Palestinian statehood, but not before agreement on thorny issues like the status of Jerusalem and final borders. The spiralling bloodshed in Gaza has revived calls for Palestinians to be given their own state, with a growing number of European countries expressing a desire to do so. Within the EU, states like France believe it is not the right time to do so, while Germany only envisages recognition following negotiations between the two sides. Tuesday's move by Spain, Ireland and Norway will mean 145 of the United Nations' 193 member states now recognise Palestinian statehood. These include many Middle Eastern, African and Asian countries but not the United States, Canada, most of western Europe, Australia, Japan or South Korea. In 2014, Sweden became the first EU member to recognise a Palestinian state. It followed in the steps of six other European countries that took the step before joining the bloc - Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania.

Palestinians have long been fighting for their independence, leading to deadly clashes with Israeli police and armed forces The decision by Madrid, Dublin and Oslo has provoked a furious response from Israel. On Monday, Foreign Minister Katz began taking 'preliminary punitive measures' against Spain, ordering its Jerusalem consulate to stop offering consular services to Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. 'We will not put up with harming Israel's sovereignty and security,' Katz said, describing recognition of Palestinian statehood as 'an award to Hamas'. On October 7, Hamas fighters stormed into southern Israel, killing more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians. Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza. The Israeli army says 37 of them are dead. Israel's relentless retaliatory offensive has killed more than 36,000 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry . On Sunday, Katz posted a video on X splicing footage of the October 7 attacks with flamenco dancing, saying: 'Sanchez: Hamas thanks you for your service' in a move denounced by Spain as 'scandalous and revolting'. A day earlier, Spanish Defence Minister Margarita Robles accused Israel of committing 'a real genocide' in Gaza. Until now, such language had only been heard from far-left ministers of Sanchez's coalition but not from a member of his Socialist party. 'Some have framed our decision to recognise the state of Palestine as... a reward for terror. Nothing could be further from the truth,' Irish Foreign Minister Micheal Martin said on Monday.

        "content": "Léa Seydoux and George MacKay star as Gabrielle and Louis in The Beast Bertrand Bonello’s latest film The Beast left me confused. It’s set in a future where emotions are considered detrimental to human progress. It follows Gabrielle, played by Léa Seydoux, as she undergoes a technologically advanced procedure to eradicate her painful emotions. This main narrative is entangled with her past lives and recurring encounters with her lover Louis, played by George MacKay. There are several time jumps, going back and forth between the decades before the First World War in Paris, to a dystopian 2044 future world and to a 2014 Los Angeles which looks like a David Lynch film. Bonello takes inspiration from The Beast in the Jungle a short 1903 novel by Henry James. James’ book is based on the idea of a man petrified by fear of an undetermined and impending catastrophe. The film translates this generalised sense of anxiety and paralysing dread and projects it onto a future dominated by artificial intelligence (AI). The film’s scenes are frequently interrupted by video glitches and alternate outcomes. This stylistic choice seems to suggest that it is all in Gabrielle’s mind during her purification rite. There is really a missed opportunity for the film to delve deeper into what is genuinely scary —the real “beast” that is the alienation and commodification of modern life. That is what sparks real fears for the human experience under capitalism. The protagonists’ performance could have been a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of systemic oppression. And it could have highlighted the importance of interpersonal relationships as a form of resistance against a dehumanising society. The film could have been a critique about the notion that technological advance requires the sacrifice of human well-being. And it could have challenged the audience to consider who benefits from technological breakthroughs in a system where profit comes first. At the end, the film dodges a traditional credit roll with a QR code that viewers have to scan. The irony is not lost on me—the only moment in which the film industry gives credit to the crew is replaced by an anonymous QR code. The Beast is in cinemas now Dopesick, available now on BBC iPlayer, is a devastating exposure of how drug firms wreck lives for profit. It charts how bosses of Purdue Pharma spread the use of the opioid Oxycontin, paying doctors to say it was safe. They also bent the authorities to say it was non-addictive and corrupted politicians to stop investigations. They ruthlessly sold more and more of it even as the bodies piled high from overdoses and the effects of addiction. Well over a million people have died in the United States since 1999 from drug overdoses and over 70 percent of such deaths have involved an opioid. Just when you think the firm can go no lower they carry out another breath-taking horror. Faced with irrefutable evidence of addiction, they find a doctor who will say that the reason for the addiction is because people are still suffering pain. They therefore need higher doses of the drug. Bosses recruit a pushy, money-obsessed salesforce and set them out to win over doctors with handouts and junkets. The eight-part series never flags. It denounces the whole Big Pharma system. And it has a strong sense of class, showing how the drug first broke through in areas where workers used painkillers to keep turning up for manual jobs even though they had suffered horrible injuries and recurrent disease. The series, first made in 2021, is as relevant as ever. And although it shows people fighting for justice and making some gains, it doesn’t pretend that the villains have gone.

        "content": "If you face trouble watching videos on YouTube, don't worry because it may be because the app's new policy about the use of ad blockers. Recently, several users faced an issue with YouTube where any video they tapped to play on their phones or tablets, skipped to the end after the first few seconds, Phone Arena reported. It simply means that you probably have an ad-blocker running on your device that needs to be turned off to watch the entire video. But why can't people use ad blockers while using YouTube? Well, last October, YouTube revealed that it was stepping up its attack against ad blockers so that users would sign up for a premium version of the app that shows no ads. This is part of Google's next move to encourage users to sign up for YouTube Premium that does not show ads. This is to make sure that the company gets paid for making all of these videos available to viewers and rewarding content creators who can monetise their work. The tech giant has emphasised that YouTube ad generated $8.09 billion for its parent company Alphabet in the first quarter. YouTube ad revenue climbed 21% annually and it contributed roughly 10% of Alphabet's total revenue during the opening three months of 2024.",

Musk, 52, reposted another post about a 12-hour new recap from last Saturday, and wrote: \"WhatsApp exports your user data every night. Some people still think it is secure.\" The X post about the news recap said that Musk had urged AI \"to prioritize truth over political correctness, warning that lies could backfire.\" A few days later, WhatsApp head Will Cathcart dismissed the tech billionaire's claim saying that it was \"not correct\". Cathcart reposted Musk's post and wrote: \"Many have said this already, but worth repeating: this is not correct.\" Cathcart revealed that the app end-to-end encrypts users' messages because it takes security of users \"seriously\". He continued: \"(Messages) don't get sent to us every night or exported to us. If you do want to backup your messages, you can use your cloud provider and you can even use end-to-end encryption for that too.\" Furthermore, Musk has not responded to Cathcart's post on X yet.",

The Chinese minister's comment came when he was addressing a press briefing for the 10th ministerial meeting of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum on Monday, Xinhua reported. According to the state news agency, Deng said that China's ties with many Arab countries have developed from \"partnership\" to \"strategic cooperative relationship\" and later to \"strategic partnership,\" achieving massive progress. The minister also noted that the forum has made remarkable achievements since its establishment 20 years ago. The two sides, during the first China-Arab States Summit in 2022, had agreed to build a community with a shared future in the new era, and China-Arab relations entered a new era of comprehensive deepening development, the minister said. \"With the joint efforts of both sides, China-Arab strategic mutual trust has been deepened, practical cooperation has delivered tangible benefits to the two peoples, cultural and people-to-people exchanges have been further enriched, and positive progress has been made in building a China-Arab community with a shared future,\" Xinhua reported, quoting Minister Deng. The minister maintained that China and Arab nations are crucial members of the developing world and share the common mission of \"realising national rejuvenation and accelerating national development\". He stressed the importance of advancing ties between China and the Arab world to further encourage peace and development in the Middle East.",

Omogoroye’s suspension was contained in a letter signed by the APC Chairman in the ward, Akinsowola Awodele, supported by twelve other exco members and made available to newsmen Monday evening in the state. According to the letter, Omogoroye was suspended for “anti-party activities and flagrant disobedience for the constituted authority of the party”. Recall that the female governorship aspirant, alleging irregularities, had approached the court to seek the cancellation of the governorship primary election that produced Governor Lucky Aiyedatiwa as the candidate of the party.",

        "content": "Beijing [China], May 28 (ANI): Amid the ongoing visit of US lawmakers to Taiwan, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning has said that Beijing strongly opposes military contact between the US and Taiwan, as well as any attempt of the nation to arm Taiwan. The visit of the US lawmakers to the self-governing island of Taiwan comes days after China conducted 'massive' military drills near Taiwan. In a regular press conference on Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning said, \"There is but one China in the world. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. China firmly opposes military contact between the US and Taiwan and any attempt to arm Taiwan.\" \"We urge relevant members of the US Congress to stop playing the \"Taiwan card,\" stop interfering in China's internal affairs, stop supporting and conniving at \"Taiwan independence\" separatist forces, and stop undermining China-US relations and cross-Strait peace and stability,\" the Foreign Ministry spokesperson said. On US lawmakers expressing support for Taiwan's defence, Mao Ning noted that it \"violates\" the one-China principle. \"In disregard of China's strong opposition, relevant members of the US Congress still decided to visit Taiwan, which violates the one-China principle, the three China-US joint communiques, and the US government's own political commitment to maintaining only unofficial relations with the Taiwan region, and sends a severely wrong signal to \"Taiwan independence\" separatist forces,\" she said. \"China firmly opposes it and has made serious protests to the US. We will take necessary measures to firmly defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated. The US senators notably promised to strengthen Taiwan's deterrence against China on Monday during a bipartisan congressional visit to the self-governing island, just days after Beijing ringed the island with major military drills. Last week's drills were the largest China had conducted in more than a year, and they occurred just days after Taiwan swore in its new president, Lai Ching-te. Lai Ching Te is openly despised by Beijing for promoting the island's sovereignty and distinct character. During a news conference in Taipei, US Representative Michael McCaul, head of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, described the exercises as an \"intimidation tactic to punish democracy\" and promised to strengthen Taiwan's defence by expediting the supply of defensive weaponry from the US, CNN reported. McCaul pledged that Taiwan would get the weapons it purchased from the US \"as soon as possible,\" citing recent foreign military financing for Taiwan approved by the US House. \"We are moving forward on those weapons systems. I'd like to see them faster, but they are forthcoming,\" he said. The US maintains strong but informal relations with Taiwan and is required by law to provide the island with weapons to protect itself. Despite never having governed Taiwan, China's governing Communist Party considers it part of its territory and has threatened to conquer it by force if necessary. (ANI)",

        "content": "BEIJING: The Communist Party of China (CPC) leadership has underscored the need to mitigate financial risks to achieve high-quality development as it concerns the country's national security and overall safety of the people, Xinhua reported on Monday. During the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee meeting, meeting, presided by General Secretary Chinese President Xi Jinping, the forum mulled over trial provisions concerning accountability for failing to prevent or defuse financial risks. The development comes as President Xi, while addressing the opening of a study session at the Party School of the CPC Central Committee (National Academy of Governance) in January, had accentuated the need to defuse systematic financial risks. The trial provisions reflected Beijing's move to bolster financial oversight to prevent and alleviate financial risks and encourage development in the financial field. The huddle also called for the strict implementation of the trial provisions — also aimed at promoting the CPC's self-governance in the financial field and strengthening the centralised and unified leadership in financial work along with ensuring relevant authorities, financial institutions, industry authorities and local Party committees and governments fulfil their duties zealously — to convey a strong message that violators will duly be held accountable. Furthermore, the meeting highlighted the need for efforts for significant breakthroughs in accelerating the country's central region's development, which in fact amounts to a tenth of the nation's land and one-quarter of the total population, comprising Shanxi, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei and Hunan provinces. The region, the huddle noted, holds importance in terms of grain production, modern equipment manufacturing, high-tech industry, energy and raw materials along with a comprehensive transportation hub. Calling for adhering to innovation-driven development and improving original scientific and technological research for breakthroughs, the participants also urged for efforts to develop new quality productive forces in line with local conditions, the expedited building of a modernised industrial system as well and the amplification of the development of the real economy sector with improved competitiveness. The move, the meeting noted, is also aimed at coordinating efforts to encourage the upgrading of traditional industries while simultaneously catering to emerging industries as well as those of the future. Underscoring the measures for the development of a modernised transportation infrastructure system along with the efficient, free and smooth flow of production factors, the huddle called for the push towards ecological conservation, environmental protection, green and low-carbon development along with continued efforts pursuing integrated development of urban and rural areas and advance rural revitalisation. Additionally, the forum also stressed the improvement in the country's capacity to ensure the supply of various resources such as grain, energy and others.",

        "content": "Luanda — Angola and Vietnam are to open up new cooperation in the fields of construction, telecommunications, digital transformation and information technology, the head of the Central Propaganda Committee of the Vietnam Communist Party, Nguyen Trong Nghia, announced Monday in Luanda. Speaking at the end of the audience granted by Angola's ruling MPLA Secretary General Paulo Pombolo, the Vietnam politician said the two countries would also bolster cooperation, in health, agriculture and education, to aid it to respond to new challenges. Regarding the meeting, Nguyen Trong Nghia said it served to assess bilateral cooperation between the two parties and countries in the political, economic and social spheres. The politician emphasized that mutual support during the wars for the liberation of Angola and Vietnam was also discussed, as well as aid in international forums, underlining that the two parties agreed to continue to expand exchanges between the two states and to strengthen cooperation through party and social organizations. Nguyen Trong Nghia leads a delegation that is in Angola on a three-day working visit. Angola and Vietnam established diplomatic relations in November 1975 and, three months later, signed a General Cooperation Agreement, an instrument that served as the basis for the opening of various protocols in the Social, Economic and Technical-Scientific areas. Relations between the two countries are limited to agriculture, health, education and trade. Around 20 private Vietnamese companies operate in Angola.",

Only the best CEOs of companies that expand the boundaries of business and generally contribute to the development of scientific and technological progress are nominated for this award.

If only banking institutions were previously responsible for issuing cards, today, thanks to companies such as Wallester, any organisation can market its card product. The changes that have taken place in the field of card issuance are tremendous.

In turn, the judges of the European CEO Awards select the winner who truly pushes business boundaries and implements progressive ideas. In 2024, the European CEO Awards 2024 was presented in 6 categories. The maximum excitement was in the FinTech Industry category. Sergey Astafjev, CEO and co-founder of Wallester won the award with a huge margin of votes. When making the decision, the judges took into account all the previous merits of the nominee, and there are indeed many of them. Sergey Astafjev was one of those who established Wallester in Tallinn in 2016. Under his keen guidance, the small startup became one of the market leaders with rapidly growing ambitions. The sphere of influence of this project increased every year, so in addition to the office in Estonia, a division was opened in Valbonne (France). Under the leadership of Mr. Astafjev, Wallester became an official partner and principal member of the Visa payment system in 2018 and, in 2023, was ranked among the top 3 best financial institutions in Estonia. Another well-deserved award for Wallester was the victory at the Fintech Breakthrough Awards in the category “Best Management Platform”. According to the European CEO Awards jury, no candidate for this award in the Fintech Industry category could compete with such achievements as Mr. Astafjev’s. He explains his success by putting not his ambitions but the needs of his clients first. A quote from Mr. Astafjev from a recent interview: “In an increasingly competitive financial technology environment, the difference between success and failure often depends on one crucial element: the quality of customer service.” This increased focus on customer satisfaction became the lever that helped Wallester to take a leading position in the fintech industry, and Astafjev himself to receive a well-deserved award. We are confident that by following such principles in its work in the future, Wallester will be able to receive many more important awards.",

        "content": "SEOUL (AFP) – Children’s products sold by the Chinese-founded online shopping giant Shein contained toxic substances in amounts hundreds of times above acceptable levels, the government of South Korea’s capital Seoul said Tuesday. Shein, headquartered in Singapore, has skyrocketed in popularity around the world in recent years, offering a vast selection of trendy clothes and accessories at stunningly low prices. This explosive growth has also led to increased scrutiny of its business practices and safety standards, including in the European Union and South Korea — where Seoul authorities have been conducting weekly inspections of items sold by platforms including Shein, Temu and AliExpress. In the latest round, they selected eight products sold by Shein, including children’s shoes, leather bags and a belt and found several to contain high amounts of phthalates — chemicals used to soften plastics. One pair of shoes contained 428 times the permitted levels of phthalates — the highest observed so far during the Seoul inspections — and three bags had amounts as high as 153 times the limit, the city government said. Phthalates are widely used to soften plastic and are found in thousands of products including containers, beauty products and toys. However, they have been known for decades to cause hormone disruptions and have been linked to obesity, heart disease, some cancers and fertility problems. Seoul city official Park Sang-jin told AFP that they have requested a removal of these products from sale, and said that since the city began inspections in April, most platforms have complied with such requests. AFP has reached out to Shein for comment. So far, Seoul authorities said they have inspected 93 products and found that almost half of them contained toxic substances. These items include children’s watches and colouring pencils. Last month, the European Union added Shein to its list of digital firms that are big enough to come under stricter safety rules — including measures to protect customers from unsafe products, especially those that could be harmful to minors. Shein and Temu have followed Chinese e-commerce titan Alibaba in challenging Amazon, especially by making inroads in the US market.",

        "content": "Tuesday, May 28, 2024 ITB China 2024, running from May 27 to 29, boasts a lineup of over 600 exhibitors from more than 80 countries and regions. This year’s event is themed “Thrive in Transformation, Reach New Heights Together,” reflecting the importance of adaptability and innovation in the travel industry, as well as the huge, untapped potential of the Chinese travel market. A major business-to-business travel trade show dedicated to helping tour operators and industry professionals tap further into the Chinese tourism market opened on Monday in Shanghai. ITB China 2024 has expanded by 60 percent from last year and is hosting a variety of keynote speeches, panel discussions and dialogues to foster collaboration and mutual support. “Since 2023, China’s travel market has been on a steady positive trajectory, and with the impact of improved visa policies and increased flight capacity, China’s travel market is showing strong signs of growth at the start of 2024,” said David Axiotis, vice president for the China market at Messe Berlin GmbH. Noting that the buyer’s market this year is buzzing with even stronger demand and a much greater number of participants, Axiotis said the event is expected to support the company’s global partners in “finding their Chinese counterparts and reaching new heights for their China travel business in the coming years.” Shanghai welcomed nearly 1.9 million inbound visitors from January to April this year, an increase of 205 percent year on year.",

What about the console players, however? When will Xbox and PlayStation fans be able to dive in?What is the Wuthering Waves Xbox and PlayStation release date?Sadly, there is no official release date for Wuthering Waves on Xbox or PlayStation at this point in time. This is likely due to a much higher focus on mobile and PC gaming in developer Kuro's home market of China. I can only assume that a strong launch focused on those platforms and the home market would give the developer enough of an engaged userbase to very confidently move forward with console releases. There is also the fact that it is easier to be agile with PC releases, allowing developers to work out any bugs and playerbase issues before releasing on consoles where certification of updates can be an issue. For now, all console players can do is wait and hope for the best. While the developers have been very open in their desire to bring the title to consoles, that doesn't mean that it will be happening anytime soon. We also don't even know if the game is confirmed to be released on both consoles yet.

        "content": "Six newborn babies are killed in a fire that ripped through Indian children's hospital with people charging into the flames to rescue the infants By Sabrina Penty and Afp Published: 09:37 BST, 28 May 2024 | Updated: 09:57 BST, 28 May 2024 e-mail 1 View comments Six newborn babies have died after a fire tore through a children's hospital in the Indian capital, with people charging into the flames to rescue the infants, police said on Sunday. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the fire and deaths 'heart-rending' in a post on social media. The fire brigade was called after flames tore through the hospital in Delhi late Saturday evening. But in the crucial first minutes, it was bystanders who spotted the fire and braved the blaze to rescue the newborns. 'All the 12 newborn babies were rescued from the hospital with the help of other people,' senior police officer Surendra Choudhary said in a statement, but added that by the time they reached medical attention, six were dead.

Burnt documents lie at the accident site. Some of the babies killed in the fire were so young that they had not been named yet , The Independent reported. The fire was likely caused by an electrical short-circut, and spread rapidly due to an oxygen cylinder exploding. 'Legal action is being taken against the owner of the hospital,' Choudhary said, but did not give further details on how the children died. In addition to the six reported killed, another baby among the 12 brought out of the ward was dead before the fire began, Choudhary said. The fire broke out in the New Born Baby Care hospital in Delhi's Vivek Vihar area, before 14 fire trucks were sent to battle the blaze, the Press Trust of India reported. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal called the situation 'heartbreaking'. Relatives gather outside a mortuary a day after the fire broke out at a Delhi children's hospital.

'We all stand with those who lost their innocent children in this accident,' he said on social media. 'The causes of the incident are being investigated, and whoever is responsible for this negligence will not be spared.' Modi also offered his condolences to those who lost their babies. 'My thoughts are with the bereaved families in this incredibly difficult time,' he wrote on social media. 'I pray that those injured recover at the earliest.' The blaze in the hospital broke out hours after a separate fire at an amusement park in India's western state of Gujarat left 27 dead, including four children, which were all under the age of 12. In that fire - which ripped through a centre with a bowling alley and other games crowded with children - police warned that many of the corpses were so badly burned it was difficult to identify them. Police Commissioner Raju Bhargava had said an investigation was underway to establish the cause of the fire, and added that police would file a case of negligence against the park owner. The blaze, which happened on Saturday in Rajkot, Gujarat, in western India, claimed the lives of 27 people including the four children, who were all under the age of 12 The park is usually packed with families with children enjoying the school summer vacation over the weekend The park is usually packed with families with children enjoying the school summer vacation over the weekend. Footage showed firefighters clearing debris around collapsed tin roof structures that media reports said were used for bowling, go-karting and trampoline attractions. The amusement park was privately owned by Yuvraj Singh Solanki. Modi wrote on X that he was 'extremely distressed by the fire in Rajkot'. He added: 'My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. Prayers for the injured.' The two fires came as northern India was gripped by intense heat, with temperatures in Delhi hitting 46.8 degrees Celsius on Saturday, according to the India Meteorological Department. Fires are common in India due to poor building practices, overcrowding and a lack of adherence to safety regulations.

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email As Donald Trump promotes increasingly aggressive plans to crack down on illegal immigration, economists express concerns that his proposals could significantly harm the U.S. job market, which has remained robust partly due to foreign-born workers. Trump is strict immigration Policies, included mass deportations, detention camps, or an expanded border wall, are central to his promise for an stronger economy. He argues that immigrant workers Reduce wages or take jobs from native-born Americans. However, they specifics of his plans remain vague, making it difficult the predict they precise implementation. Economic Concerns Over Immigration Crackdown Economists and business leaders warn that Trump’s proposals could lead to higher unemployment and slower economic growth, particularly affecting the immigrant workforce. Key industries like construction, food service, and agriculture could face severe disruptions. Additionally, these measures could exacerbate inflation, a major economic concern for many voters. The U.S. job market has rebounded strongly from the pandemic, thanks in part to immigration. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the labor force will grow by 5.2 million people by 2033 due to net immigration, contributing an additional $7 trillion to the economy over the next decade. Economist Chloe East from the University of Colorado Denver emphasizes that the economy is not a zero-sum game: “When one person has a job, that does not mean one less job for somebody else.” She warns that mass deportations would likely increase the unemployment rate for U.S.-born workers, with long-lasting effects. An asylum lawyer might argue that such policies not only harm the economy but also infringe on the rights and protections of vulnerable individuals seeking refuge in the U.S. Trump’s Immigration Plans and Potential Impacts Trump has pledged to execute the largest domestic deportation operation in American history, targeting over 11 million undocumented immigrants and possibly building detention camps to expedite the process. He also intends to reimplement policies from his first term, such as “Remain in Mexico” and Title 42, which impose stringent border controls. Trump argues that undocumented immigrants receive better treatment than native-born Americans seeking jobs, promising to replace what he calls the “Biden economic bust” with a “Trump economic boom.” However, many experts believe his policies could backfire. For example, George Borjas, a Harvard economist, has found that a 10 percent increase in immigration within a particular group can lower that group’s wages by 3 to 4 percent, affecting workers with lower education levels. Yet, he also noted that these lower wages could lead to higher profits for employers, ultimately benefiting the broader economy. The Role of Immigrants in Key Industries Under the Biden administration, hundreds of thousands of migrants have entered the U.S. legally through expanded visa and refugee programs. While undocumented workers have less leverage to demand higher pay, overall wages are rising, and unemployment remains low. Economists argue that the job market would suffer from mass deportations , especially in sectors like construction and agriculture, which still struggle to hire post-pandemic. Research by East and others on the labor market effects of the Secure Communities policy found that for every 100,000 undocumented immigrants forced to leave, there were roughly 9,000 fewer jobs for U.S.-born workers. This is because undocumented workers often hold essential jobs that support other roles. For instance, a restaurant might rely on an undocumented worker as a busboy or line cook, enabling the employment of servers and hosts, who are more likely to be native-born. Without these workers, businesses could face operational challenges. Industry Leaders’ Perspectives The construction industry, still short about half a million workers, would face significant challenges if 11 million people were deported. Alan Hoffmann, president of Hoffmann Homes in Dallas-Fort Worth, predicts that such a move would drive up wages and housing costs due to increased competition for workers. Similarly, the agricultural sector, which relies heavily on undocumented labor, would be severely impacted. Michael Marsh, president of the National Council of Agricultural Employers, highlights that around 950,000 of the country’s 2.2 million agricultural workers are unauthorized. Removing these workers could lead to fewer services and upward pressure on wages, hurting the economy. Potential Unintended Consequences Despite Trump’s promises to combat inflation, many economists argue that his policies could worsen price growth. His proposed tariffs on imported goods and disruptions to the labor market could increase inflation. Employers, including those who supported Trump in the past, express concerns about the potential negative effects on legal immigration and their ability to fill essential roles. In southwestern Michigan, Fred Leitz, co-owner of Leitz Farms, relies on the H-2A visa program for temporary agricultural workers. He fears that Trump’s policies could unintentionally impact legal immigration, making it impossible to fill about 200 jobs on his farm. Similarly, Jeremy Dougherty, general manager of the Bar Harbor Inn in Maine, relies on H-2B visa holders for seasonal staff. He recalls significant delays in 2017 due to changes in visa processing under Trump and worries about the uncertainty a second Trump term could bring. Conclusion Trump’s aggressive immigration plans could have profound and far-reaching impacts on the U.S. job market and economy. While intended to bolster employment for native-born Americans, these policies risk creating labor shortages, increasing costs, and disrupting key industries. As the debate over immigration continues, policymakers must carefully consider the economic implications to ensure a balanced approach that supports both native-born and immigrant workers .

        "content": "The Golden Eaglets of Nigeria will do battle against Ghana’s Black Starlets in the third-place playoff of the WAFU B U17 Championship at the University of Ghana Sports Stadium on Tuesday. The Golden Eaglets were defeated by Cote d’Ivoire’s Baby Elephants in the semi-finals, while the Black Starlets were overpowered by Burkina Faso’s Baby Etalons. With the West African Football Union yet to confirm the number of teams advancing to the 2025 Africa U17 Cup of Nations from WAFU B, Dr. Mohammed Sanusi, the General Secretary of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), has urged the Eaglets to treat the third-place match as a final. “We are still awaiting clarity on the number of teams that will qualify for the U17 AFCON from this tournament. Some have said three teams, others four. Therefore, it is crucial that our boys give their all to secure third place,” Sanusi stated. “The Black Starlets will not be easy opponents. They have the advantage of being the home side and will have fan support. But our boys have what it takes to win.” The third-place match will kick off at 4 PM Nigeria time at the University of Ghana Sports Stadium. The final between Burkina Faso and Cote d’Ivoire will follow at 7 PM Nigeria time.",

        "description": "The Conservatives claim the new pledge could save the average pensioner around £100 next year",
        "content": "The Conservatives have announced plans for a major tax giveaway for pensioners if the party wins the next election in a bid to shore up their support among older voters. Dubbed the “triple lock plus”, the changes build on the existing triple lock system to ensure those receiving the state pension do not pay extra tax due to frozen income tax thresholds. The Tories have said the policy is fully funded, with the extra spending covered by cracking down on tax avoidance, but Labour has accused the party of making “billions of pounds” in unfunded pledges in the first week of the campaign. What is the ‘triple lock plus’? The Conservative Party has announced a plan to introduce a new “age-related” tax-free allowance for pensioners , referred to as “triple lock plus”. This measure aims to reduce the tax burden on retirees by adjusting their tax-free income threshold in line with average earnings, inflation, or a 2.5 per cent increase – whichever is higher – beginning next April. This policy mimics the existing “triple lock” system used for annual state pension increases. Currently, pensioners can receive up to £12,570 per year before they start paying income tax, a threshold identical to the personal allowance for working individuals. However, the number of pensioners subject to income tax has doubled since 2010, now exceeding nine million. In addition, the personal tax-free allowance was frozen at the Budget in March 2021 and will not rise until 2028, when the state pension is predicted to be £12,893. The rise in the full state pension to £11,502 this April has already brought many pensioners close to the £12,570 tax threshold, meaning that even a small additional income could trigger tax liability. Official figures show that approximately 80 per cent of pensioners supplement their state pension with income from private or workplace pensions. The Conservatives’ new proposal would align retirees’ personal tax-free allowance with the state pension increases, effectively creating a “quadruple lock.” This initiative is designed to prevent pensioners from being taxed on their state pension, addressing growing concerns over frozen tax thresholds that have left many retirees vulnerable to income tax. !function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}(); How will the 'triple lock plus' affect your pension? Under the Conservative plans, by 2028 the state pension will be £12,893, while the personal allowance for pensioners would be £13,710. The party has claimed that the “triple lock plus” could save an average pensioner around £100 next year, with potential savings increasing to £275 annually by the end of the next Parliament. Under the proposed policy, a pensioner receiving £31,300 annually - the amount deemed necessary for a \"moderate\" retirement by the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association - would save £228 in taxes each year. The changes come in addition to the existing triple lock, which is currently forecast to see the state pension rise by £430 next April and by around £1,700 a year by the end of the Parliament. Announcing the plan, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak emphasised his party’s commitment to ensuring financial security for retirees. \"I passionately believe that those who have worked hard all their lives should have peace of mind and security in retirement,\" he said. \"Thanks to the Conservatives' triple lock, pensions have risen by £900 this year, and now we will cut their taxes by around £100 next year.\" \"This bold action demonstrates we are on the side of pensioners. The alternative is Labour dragging everyone in receipt of the full state pension into income tax for the first time in history.\" The policy aims to bolster financial support for pensioners, countering the impacts of frozen tax thresholds. The Conservatives argue that their plan will prevent many pensioners from falling into the tax bracket on modest additional earnings, a growing concern for many amid high inflation . However, not all pensioners will benefit equally. Those in the additional rate tax band, earning over £125,140 annually, may see no advantage from this policy since they do not benefit from the personal allowance. How will the ‘triple lock plus’ be paid for? This new policy is estimated to cost the Treasury around £2.4bn per year and will be funded by existing plans to crack down on tax avoidance and evasion , which the party estimates will generate £6bn a year by 2030. But part of this £6bn - £1bn worth - has already been ringfenced to pay for the Tories’ other election announcement of introducing a new model of national service . The state pension is already expected to cost the Government £124bn in 2023-24, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Labour attacked the policy as being uncosted and accused the Tories of making spending announcements that do not add up. Shadow Paymaster General Jonathan Ashworth said the Conservatives have already “promised to spend tens of billions of pounds since this campaign began” and were already planning a “completely unfunded £46bn policy to scrap national insurance that threatens the very basis of the state pension”. \"Labour will protect the triple lock,” he added. “But Rishi Sunak is planning to reward Britain's pensioners for their loyalty by stabbing them in the back, just like he did to Boris Johnson and just like he has done to his own MPs.\"",

The attack took place on a bus going from Kozhikode to Bangalore. Sultan Bathery native Muhammad Ashraf was attacked by a five-member gang. Earlier, one among the gang came to board the bus but was not allowed entry since the seating was full and the bus didn’t entertain standing passengers. The man got angry over the incident and left the place only to soon park his car in front of the bus and confront the driver. Ashraf intervened in the issue and asked the gang to not create a ruckus. This agitated the other members who according to Ashraf pushed him aside which later resulted in physical torture. Police led by Thamarassery SI Shaji reached the spot following a complaint by the bus staff. The police have started an investigation to catch the dark blue Swift car used by the accused. The police have received information that the accused are natives of Thamarassery, Karadi.",

        "content": "Your pet's annual wellness exams are great to see if your pet has gained (or lost) any weight, discuss with your veterinarian the development of any medical or behavioral trends, and focus on keeping your dog as healthy as possible. A wellness visit also is a great opportunity for your dog to get up to date on their vaccines and to get medication to help protect them from parasites such as worms, fleas and ticks. What is a wellness exam? A wellness examination is a routine medical examination or checkup of your dog who appears healthy as opposed to an examination of a dog who presents for illness or accidents. Why are wellness exams important? Dogs can't communicate their feelings, and owners often are unaware of hidden or subtle changes occurring in their dogs, such as weight loss, dental disease or development of heart conditions and murmurs. A health condition may become advanced before a dog shows obvious signs that an owner recognizes. Regular wellness exams can help your veterinarian detect signs earlier so prompt medical attention can be focused to manage or correct a problem before it becomes severe enough to affect a dog's quality of life. Are wellness exams only necessary once a year? No. The frequency of wellness exams depends on a dog's individual age and health status. Puppies should get examined while they are getting their series of vaccines, often starting around 7 to 8 weeks of age and finishing up at 16 to 20 weeks. After that, if they are healthy, once a year should be sufficient unless any medical issues arise. With an average adult dog, annual wellness exams are usually sufficient until they become senior or geriatric dogs. At that point, a wellness exam every six months is usually recommended. The exact age when a dog becomes \"senior\" varies but is usually around 7 to 9 years of age, depending on the size and breed of dog. Largeand giant-breed dogs age more quickly than toy-and small-breed dogs. Your veterinarian is in the best position to recommend how often your dog should have a wellness examination. Is there anything I need to do to prepare my dog? Prepare yourself with some basic information, such as knowing the brand and type of food that your dog eats, any supplement you may be giving and a list of questions or concerns that you have regarding your dog's behavior or health. If your dog is a recent acquisition or adoption, bring in any past medical and vaccine records. What will my vet check during a wellness exam? Your veterinary clinic will usually request that you bring in a fresh sample of your dog's feces collected prior to the wellness examination. This sample will be processed and microscopically evaluated for the presence of parasite eggs. This is important for all dogs but especially important for puppies, because many puppies have intestinal parasites. Fecal samples should also be brought in to your veterinarian if your dog is having bouts of loose stool or diarrhea. During a routine wellness examination, your veterinarian will get a history by asking you questions about your dog's diet and appetite, exercise, how much they're drinking and urinating, bowel movements and if there have been any changes in your dog's typical habits or behavior. Your veterinarian will then perform a thorough physical examination of your dog. Based on your pet's history and physical examination, your veterinarian will then make recommendations for specific preventive treatments. In some dogs, especially older dogs, additional diagnostics might be recommended, such as radiographs of the chest or abdomen to assess organ shape and size.

        "content": "Jason and the Argonauts (1963) TCM, 8 p.m. Legendary stop-motion special-effects master Ray Harryhausen achieved what is probably his greatest triumph in terms of bringing the fantastical to thrilling life in this 1963 feature based on the ancient Greek tale about the hero Jason (Todd Armstrong), who leads the men of his ship the Argo in a quest to find the fabled Golden Fleece. The human characters and actors here are fairly \"meh\"; the gods, played by actors like Niall MacGinnis as Zeus and Honor Blackman as Hera, are more interesting and fun. But the real stars of the film are the various Harryhausen-created monsters that Jason and crew encounter and battle along the way in a series of spectacular set pieces that are still pretty thrilling to watch today. There are harpies; the multi-headed Hydra that guards the Fleece; Talos, the enormous, sword-wielding bronze statue that springs to life to pursue the men; and, of course, the iconic skeleton army, born from the teeth of the slain Hydra, that fights the Argonauts in an amazing, climactic battle that took Harryhausen and his team four months of painstaking attention to detail to pull off . All of the fantasy action is set to a rousing musical score by Bernard Herrmann. Get local news delivered to your inbox!",

        "content": "Dear Readers: I appreciate it when people give me \"updates\" on previously published advice. This update follows the Q&A, which was originally published in 2016. Dear Amy: I'm hoping for a career in art, specifically as an illustrator. Three years ago I graduated with an art degree and have been working to make that happen, doing a lot of research, building a portfolio and exploring my options. I work part time to keep myself fed, but otherwise I'm always drawing, painting and networking. My family and friends are supportive, which is wonderful, but there is a big problem. They don't understand why it is taking me so long. So they offer art advice, although they are not artists: advice on what to paint, how much to sell it for, whom to work for and so on. Sometimes the advice is ridiculous, if not insulting: \"Just go work for Disney,\" or \"Nobody wants to buy those kinds of paintings. Paint portraits; those will sell.\" Or, \"Do it for the exposure if you have to.\" They don't trust that I know what I'm doing, and they don't recognize how hard I'm working. It gets to the point where I don't want to talk about my art at all. I want to enjoy my family get-togethers again. How can I let on (politely) that I'm not interested in their bombardment of ill-informed advice? – Struggling Artist Dear Struggling: Everybody's an expert, and the less people know about your particular field, the more \"expert\" their advice becomes. What you are going through is akin to people telling a certain struggling writer (yours truly), \"You should write a book and get Oprah to endorse it!\" This sort of statement might actually be a vote of confidence from the person offering it; unfortunately, instead it highlights the fact that none of these spectacular goals has been met. It's a quick way to feel like a loser. Don't stop talking about your work (if you're asked) — or avoid or ignore this unsolicited advice — but look for effective ways to cope with it. \"You should work for Disney,\" could be met with \"That might be very cool. Do you know anyone there I can call?\" Remember that this is your fan club; they're just disguised as a chorus of know-it-alls. Dear Amy: I wrote to you as a struggling artist who was bombarded with bad career advice from family and friends. Well, I'm still a struggling artist and I'm still bombarded with ill-fitting advice, but I'm excited to say I've just received an offer. I am going to be a published children's book author/illustrator! The best thing I did was ask for advice from authors and illustrators. I joined the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators, and got involved with the local chapter. I'm lucky I found a kick-butt agent and a wonderful writing group. Meanwhile I let the bad advice from my family roll off my back. I know they mean well, and I'm sure they'll be thrilled to receive a copy of my picture book. My grandma, who taught me how to paint as a child, has dementia now and can't give advice anymore, but she giggles in delight when I doodle for her. She's still my biggest fan. – Soon to be Published Dear Soon to be Published: Your update is delightful. Your hard work has really paid off! I look forward to adding your book to my library.

        "content": "When the heat of summer sets in, I just want to eat meals that will cool me down. My relationship with soups, stews and basically anything that comes out of the oven is on hold for these next few months. I prefer easy summer dinners that come together quickly when I don't feel like cooking. Needless to say, this shrimp ceviche is on heavy rotation. Instead of relying on citrus juice to \"cook\" the shrimp, we're poaching the shrimp quickly in hot water. Poaching gently cooks shrimp for the best texture. Then, the shrimp are marinated in freshly squeezed lime and lemon juice with ripe summer tomatoes, red onion, jalapeno and fresh cilantro. Add creamy, diced avocado right before serving. It's tangy and refreshing, perfect for those hot summer days. Serve the ceviche with homemade tostadas, crunchy plantain chips or tortilla chips for scooping. Don't forget to make pitcher margaritas and invite some friends over. Here's how to make the best (and easiest) shrimp ceviche.

Submit any comments or questions to editorial@thekitchn.com . Easy shrimp ceviche Servings: 4 to 6 Ingredients ■ 1 pound peeled and deveined raw medium shrimp, thawed if frozen ■ 1⁄4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (from 2 lemons) ■ 1⁄4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice (from 2 to 3 limes) ■ 2 medium tomatoes, seeded and chopped ■ 1⁄2 small red onion, finely chopped ■ 1 medium jalapeno, seeded and finely chopped (about 3 tablespoons) ■ 1⁄2 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems ■ 1⁄2 teaspoon kosher salt ■ 1 medium avocado ■ Tostadas or tortilla chips, for serving (optional) Directions Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Turn off the heat, add the shrimp, and poach until the shrimp are opaque and just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the shrimp and set aside until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes. Chop the shrimp into 1⁄2-inch pieces and place in a large bowl. Add lemon juice, lime juice, tomatoes, red onion, jalapeno, cilantro and salt, and toss to combine. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 4 hours. Just before serving, dice the avocado, add to the ceviche, and gently toss to combine. Serve with tostadas or tortilla chips, if desired. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 day. Helpful swaps To save time, you can use frozen cooked shrimp instead of frozen raw shrimp. Thaw completely and drain well before using. For a spicier ceviche, use serrano peppers instead of jalapeno. Get local news delivered to your inbox!",

        "content": "No summertime spread is complete without a pot of baked beans. Tender beans slowcooked in a sweet and smoky sauce pair perfectly with mains from the grill. The trouble is, many baked bean recipes focus on the bacon rather than the beans. Luckily, if you're serving guests who abstain from pork, or are simply trying to entertain on a budget, there's a way to serve the classic side without adding any meat at all. By making a few smart pantry picks, it's simple to turn humble canned beans into the classic potluck side dish. Building flavors Baked bean recipes often rely on bacon for their savory, smoky flavor. In order to make vegetarian baked beans that don't sacrifice flavor, start by sautéing a diced yellow onion until it starts to brown. Here, the caramelization adds a rich depth of flavor that raw onion or onion powder cannot replicate. For even more savory flavor, add a splash of soy sauce or tamari — just make sure to choose the low-sodium version so that you have more control over the level of salt. Lastly, bittersweet molasses and smoked paprika provide that smoky flavor. Other tips These vegetarian baked beans can be prepared up to five days in advance if kept in the refrigerator. Baked beans thicken upon cooling, so make sure to add an extra splash of water to loosen them up before reheating on the stovetop over low heat until warmed through. Vegetarian baked beans Servings: 4 to 6; makes about 3 cups Ingredients ■ 2 (about 15-ounce) cans great northern, navy or pinto beans ■ 1 medium yellow onion ■ 2 tablespoons olive oil ■ 2 cups water ■ 1⁄4 cup ketchup ■ 1⁄4 cup molasses (not blackstrap) ■ 3 tablespoons packed light brown sugar ■ 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar ■ 1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce or tamari ■ 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed ■ 2 teaspoons smoked paprika ■ 1 1⁄2 teaspoons dry mustard powder ■ 1 teaspoon garlic powder ■ 1⁄4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper ■ 1⁄4 teaspoon ground cloves ■ 1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional) Directions Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 325 F. Drain and rinse cans of beans. Dice the onion. Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven or large cast-iron skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the beans, water, ketchup, molasses, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, soy sauce or tamari, salt, smoked paprika, dry mustard powder, garlic powder, black pepper, ground cloves and cayenne pepper, if desired. Stir to combine and bring to a boil. Transfer to the oven and bake uncovered until the liquid is reduced and the beans darken in color, stirring halfway through, 60 to 70 minutes total. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool and thicken slightly, about 5 minutes. Taste and season with more kosher salt as needed. Get local news delivered to your inbox!",

        "content": "GRETCHEN'S TABLE Kebabs are an easy way for home cooks to get meat and a variety of vegetables on the table at the same time. Plus, skewered food is just fun to eat, especially in the warmer months, when dining tends to be a little more casual. For this recipe, I used top sirloin, a cut that's leaner than ribeye but still full of beefy flavor. A quick bath in an acidic and garlicky marinade guarantees it will be tender. A few tips: Be careful not to thread the skewers too tightly; the heat won't be able to properly circulate if the meat and veggies are crowded together. Also keep in mind that meats and vegetables cook at different rates — you'll want to choose ones with similar densities. Produce that is extremely delicate (such as cherry tomatoes) or markedly smaller should be cooked on a separate skewer and taken off the heat earlier. I used bell pepper, Vidalia onion and zucchini for my kebabs, but you also could thread the skewers with mushrooms, eggplant or red onion — whatever floats your boat. For a less spicy sauce, reduce or omit the jalapeno pepper. Grilled steak kebabs with spicy cilantro sauce Servings: 4 For marinade ■ 1⁄4 cup olive oil ■ 1⁄4 cup soy sauce ■ Juice of 1 orange ■ 1 tablespoon honey ■ 1 scant tablespoon Dijon mustard ■ 2 garlic cloves, minced ■ 1 or 2 pinches dried red pepper fl akes ■ Pinch of dried oregano ■ Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper For kebabs ■ 1 1⁄2 pounds top sirloin steak, cut into chunks ■ 1 red or yellow bell pepper, seeded and cut into chunks ■ 1 large sweet onion, peeled and cut into wedges ■ 1 zucchini or summer squash, cut into chunks For cilantro sauce ■ 1 8-ounce container plain Greek yogurt ■ 1 generous handful cilantro, stems removed and chopped ■ Juice of 1 lime ■ 1 clove garlic, minced ■ 1⁄2 jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped ■ Pinch of salt For rice ■ 4 cups cooked rice ■ Juice and zest of 1 lime ■ 1 generous handful cilantro, stems removed and chopped Directions Prepare marinade by mixing olive oil, soy sauce, orange juice, honey, mustard, garlic, pepper fl akes, oregano, and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl or resealable zip-close bag. Add steak chunks, and stir/massage to combine and make sure all the meat is covered with marinade. Place in refrigerator for at least 1 hour or up to 4 hours. When ready to cook, preheat a grill over medium-high heat to about 425 F (I cooked over charcoal). Prepare cilantro sauce by placing all ingredients in a food processor or blender and blending until smooth; taste and add more lime juice or salt to taste. Set aside while you grill kebabs. Using metal skewers, or bamboo skewers that have been soaked in water, thread the marinated meat along with the veggies, alternating them on the skewer. (I divided everything among 4 skewers.) Be sure to keep a little daylight between the individual pieces — it'll help everything cook evenly on the grill. You'll also want to brush the skewers with some of the remaining marinade and discard the rest. Brush grill grates lightly with oil. Place kebabs on hot grill and grill until center of steak registers about 140 to 145 F for medium, turning kebabs occasionally, about 8 to 9 minutes. In large bowl, fl uff cooked rice with fork to separate grains, then add lime juice and zest and chopped cilantro. Toss to combine. Transfer rice to a large platter, and place kebabs on top. Serve immediately with cilantro sauce. Get local news delivered to your inbox!",

        "description": "Spain, Ireland and Norway said they will recognize a Palestinian state, a step toward a long-held Palestinian aspiration that came amid international outrage over the civilian death toll and humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip following Israel's offensive.",
        "content": "Spain, Ireland and Norway said they will recognize a Palestinian state, a step toward a long-held Palestinian aspiration that came amid international outrage over the civilian death toll and humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip following Israel's offensive. The almost simultaneous decisions by two European Union countries, and Norway, may generate momentum for the recognition of a Palestinian state by other EU countries and could spur further steps at the United Nations, deepening Israel's isolation. Previously, just seven members of the 27-nation European Union officially recognized a Palestinian state. Five of them are former east bloc countries that announced recognition in 1988, as did Cyprus, before joining the bloc. Sweden announced recognition in 2014. The Czech Republic, an EU member, said that the 1988 recognition by the former Czechoslovakia — of which it then formed a part — does not apply to the modern state. Slovakia's Foreign Ministry said the two sides confirmed their recognition as Slovakia was becoming independent in 1992-93, and that the Palestinian state has had a fully functioning embassy in Bratislava since 2006. EU members Malta and Slovenia are considering following suit, though not immediately. Some 140 of the roughly 190 countries represented in the U.N. have already recognized a Palestinian state. Here's a look at how and why the new European announcements could be important: Why does it matter? A U.N. partition plan in 1947 called for the creation of a Jewish state alongside a Palestinian state, but Palestinians and the wider Arab world rejected it because it would have given them less than half of the land even though Palestinians made up two-thirds of the population. The Arab-Israeli war the following year left Israel with even more territory, Jordan in control of the West Bank and east Jerusalem, and Egypt in control of Gaza. In the 1967 war, Israel seized all three territories, and decades of on-again, off-again peace talks have failed. The United States, Britain and other Western countries have backed the idea of an independent Palestinian state existing alongside Israel as a solution to the Middle East's most intractable conflict, but they insist Palestinian statehood should come as part of a negotiated settlement. There have been no substantive negotiations since 2009. Though the EU countries and Norway aren't recognizing an existing state, just the possibility of one, the symbolism helps enhance the Palestinians' international standing and heaps more pressure on Israel to open negotiations on ending the war. Why now? Diplomatic pressure on Israel has grown as the battle with Hamas stretches into its eighth month. The U.N. General Assembly voted by a significant margin on May 11 to grant new \"rights and privileges\" to Palestine in a sign of growing international support for a vote on full voting membership. The Palestinian Authority currently has observer status. The leaders of Spain, Ireland, Malta and Slovenia said in March they were considering recognizing a Palestinian state as \"a positive contribution\" toward ending the war. \"This recognition is not against anyone, it is not against the Israeli people,\" said Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez. \"It is an act in favor of peace, justice and moral consistency.\" Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide told The Associated Press that while the country has supported the establishment of a Palestinian state for decades, recognition is \"a card that you can play once.\" \"We used to think that recognition would come at the end of a process,\" he said. \"Now we have realized that recognition should come as an impetus, as a strengthening of a process.\" What are the implications of recognition? While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so, and it is unclear how much of a difference the move by the three countries will make. Even so, their recognition marks a significant accomplishment for the Palestinians, who believe it confers international legitimacy on their struggle. Norway said it will upgrade its representative's office for Palestine to an embassy but it was not clear what Ireland and Spain will do. Little would likely change on the ground in the short term. Peace talks are stalled, and Israel's hardline government has dug its heels in against Palestinian statehood. What is Israel's response? Israel, which rejects any move to legitimize the Palestinians internationally, reacted rapidly to May 22's announcement by recalling its ambassadors to Ireland, Norway and Spain. In a video statement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that \"the intention of several European countries to recognize a Palestinian state is a reward for terrorism.\" He said \"80% of the Palestinians in Judea and Samaria (West Bank) support the terrible massacre of October 7. This evil must not be given a state. This will be a terrorist state.\" He was referring to the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the abduction of over 250 others. Steps like the ones by the three European countries will harden the Palestinian position and undermine the negotiating process, Israel says, insisting that all issues be solved through negotiations. Israel often responds to foreign countries' decisions deemed as going against its interests by summoning those countries' ambassadors and also punishing the Palestinians through measures such as freezing tax transfers to the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority. Who recognizes a Palestinian state? Some 140 countries recognize a Palestinian state, more than two-thirds of the United Nations' membership. Some major powers have indicated their stance may be evolving amid the outcry over the consequences of Israel's offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said no recognition of a Palestinian state could come while Hamas remains in Gaza, but that it could happen while Israeli negotiations with Palestinian leaders were in progress. France indicated that it isn't ready to join other countries in recognizing a Palestinian state, even if it isn't opposed to the idea in principle. French Foreign Minister Stéphane Séjourné, in comments relayed by his ministry after a recent closed-door meeting with his Israeli counterpart, said that recognizing a Palestinian state must be \"useful\" in pushing forward a two-state solution and suggested that doing so now won't have a genuine impact in pursuing that goal. Germany, meanwhile, said it will not recognize a Palestinian state for the time being. A spokesman for Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Germany was hoping for a negotiated two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians that would lead to a separate Palestinian state but admits that that solution, while being the best one, is a long way off.

        "description": "NORTH KOREA | CULTURAL TRADITIONS",
        "content": "NORTH KOREA | CULTURAL TRADITIONS The portrait of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was publicly displayed along with those of his father and grandfather for the first time, sparking speculation about the message it sends. Portraits of leaders are at the core of North Korea's state-sponsored cult of personality that has buttressed the Kim family's rule since the country's foundation in 1948. Almost all homes and public offices in North Korea must have portraits of Kim's father Kim Jong Il and grandfather Kim Il Sung, but featuring that of the younger Kim hadn't yet been a requirement until recently. Here's a look at what it means and why now: What exactly happened? North Korea's state media recently released a photo showing Kim Jong Un's large portrait hung on the wall of a building alongside those of Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung, during his recent visit to the Central Cadres Training School of the ruling Workers' Party. Another state media photo showed the smaller portraits of the three Kims placed side by side in a classroom, where Kim Jong Un, seated in a chair, talked to officials who took notes on his remarks. Longtime North Korea watchers say it's the first time for North Korea to publicize images showing the portrait of Kim Jong Un installed together with those of the two late North Korean rulers since the younger Kim took power in late 2011. Is Kim boosting his personality cult? Placing his portrait next to those of his father and grandfather suggests he wants to elevate his status to a level similar to that of the past two leaders, who are the subject of a strong and loyal following and regarded like gods. By doing so, Kim Jong Un wants to announce the start of his own era, according to Kwak Gil Sup, head of One Korea Center, a website specializing in North Korea affairs. Few foreign experts question Kim's grip on power. But the 40-year-old has still avoided the same level of personality cult bestowed on his predecessors: they are memorialized in numerous statues and mosaics across North Korea, their birthdays are two of the country's biggest holidays and pins bearing their likenesses are worn by all North Korean adults. Kwak said Kim Jong Un's portrait will now likely be hung on the walls of all households while his birthday could also be designated an official holiday. The place where his portrait was recently hung is the highest education facility for ruling party brass. Kwak said it shows that \"Kim Jong Un wants to begin a new era with new people.\" Observers say Kim needs stronger domestic support of his leadership as he struggles to navigate his country past economic hardships and protracted tensions with the United States over his nuclear program. In January, Kim announced he will no longer pursue a peaceful unification with South Korea, a decadeslong policy cherished by his father and grandfather. Any problem with propaganda drive? Prospects for Kim's push aren't clear, though he likely thinks he has bolstered his power and built his nuclear and other military programs strong enough to elevate himself in the national mythology. Kim's headlong pursuit of a bigger nuclear arsenal has drawn punishing U.S.-led sanctions, which together with border closures during the COVID-19 pandemic were believed to have badly hurt the North's fragile economy. Kim subsequently admitted policy failures as his vow that North Koreans would \"never have to tighten their belts again\" remained unfulfilled. \"For regime propaganda to reach such a stage of personality cult suggests both impressive confidence and insecurity,\" said Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. \"However, this is also a political gamble, with Kim betting that ideology can buy time to address North Korea's economic struggles and social divisions,\" Easley said. Is his portrait prelude to another hereditary power transfer? Cheong Seong-Chang, an analyst at the private Sejong Institute in South Korea, said Kim's portrait is more likely associated with his possible bid to groom his preteen daughter, reportedly named Kim Ju Ae, as his heir. \"By hanging the portraits of all three — Kim Jong Un, Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung — I assess that North Korea is underscoring the need to extend the Paektu bloodline to justify another hereditary power transfer for Ju Ae,\" Cheong said, referring to the Kim family's lineage named after the country's most sacred mountain. Ju Ae, who is about 10, was the subject of keen outside attention as she accompanied her father on a series of high-profile events such as missile tests and military parades since late 2022. State media called her Kim Jong Un's \"most beloved\" or \"respected\" child while churning out footage and photos proving her soaring political standing and closeness with her father. In January, South Korea's spy agency said it saw Ju Ae as her father's likely heir apparent. Some experts say it's too premature to determine Ju Ae is Kim's heir, given her age and North Korea's male-dominated power hierarchy. Get local news delivered to your inbox!",

        "content": "Enforcement Directorate Kolkata: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) in its chargesheet on Monday stated that suspended Trinamool Congress leader Sheikh Shahjahan adopted innovative way to channelise illegal money that he earned through land grabbing. Sources told IANS on Tuesday that the ED has provided details on the innovative methods that Sheikh Shahjahan used to launder his illegal money and that of other politically-influential people in West Bengal According to the sources, the leader from Sandeshkhali in North 24 Parganas District first parked the unaccounted proceeds in comparatively smaller accounts in multiple banks that were held by his associates, and then, in due course that money was invested in legal businesses, the returns of which were shown as legitimately accounted for money. Sources added that all these details were mentioned in the chargesheet submitted by the ED at a special court of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in Kolkata on Monday afternoon. Sources said that the majority of the illegal money was laundered through Shahjahan’s fish export business and the company was registered in the name of his daughter. In the chargesheet, the ED has accused Shahjahan of collecting Rs 261 crore through illegal land grabbing in Sandeshkhali. On Monday, the ED had informed the special court that till now it had identified 59.5 acres of illegally-grabbed land. Besides Shahjahan, his brother Sheikh Alamgir and his close associates Didar Bux Molla and Siboprasad Hazra have been named as accused in the chargesheet. The ED has so far confiscated assets and property worth Rs 27 crore owned by Shahjahan.",

        "description": "ELECTION 2024",
        "content": "ELECTION 2024 Lara Trump is wasting no time rebranding the typically staid Republican National Committee in the image of her father-in-law, former President Donald Trump, and showcasing her own version of his pugilistic politics and brash management style. In an interview with The Associated Press, Lara Trump spoke about her famous family, the upcoming election and her vision for the party going forward. Here are four takeaways about the new RNC co-chair's first few months on the job. Merging with the Trump campaign When Lara Trump and Chairman Michael Whatley took the reins in March, they promised to enact sweeping changes. They did: They merged the GOP and the Trump campaign into a single operation. Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, told the AP the strategy is essential to ensuring Republican victories in November. \"By joining the two organizations together,\" he said, \"we are all rolling in the same direction to get President Trump elected, as well as to increase the majority of the House and the Senate.\" Lara Trump said party and campaign staff are \"all part of organizing the ground game, working on day-to-day operations.\" Critics say such a laser focus on the presidential election could mean less time, money and resources spent on state and local races. That could hurt the party in the long term. Lara Trump brushed off such critiques, saying the restructuring will ensure the RNC is supporting candidates in state and local races. \"It would be very silly of me to assume that only having the presidency would be able to achieve the goals of the Republican Party,\" she said. \"Obviously, that requires majorities in Congress, and that's our goal.\" Stepping into the spotlight Unlike some previous party cochairs, Lara Trump is embracing a very public role. She is doing television interviews and speaking on right-wing media outlets to promote her father-in-law's bid for reelection. Her public turn hasn't been without controversy: She's made a few public gaffes, including an appearance on Newsmax, a conservative cable channel, during which she said the RNC had filed lawsuits in \"81 states.\" Acknowledging a \"big, big learning curve,\" Lara Trump told the AP she has the requisite background to succeed, having worked on both of Trump's previous presidential campaigns. \"You'd be hard pressed,\" she said, \"to find someone who has had as much political experience as I have in any campaign right now, and that's kind of unique to be able to say.\" Fundraising turnaround Lara Trump appears to have already helped turn around the committee's anemic fundraising operation. Republicans say she is a sought-after speaker on the fundraising circuit and has helped excite donors. The RNC brought in $76 million in April and $65.6 million in March, compared with $10.6 million in February. The increase also reflects changes in donation limits after Trump, in March, became the party's presumptive nominee. The Democratic National Committee, by comparison, raised far less in April, $51 million, down from $72 million in March. The RNC's ability to pump money into the election could prove critical to Trump's chances, in part, because he is choosing to spend campaign donations on legal fees. The former president is facing dozens of federal and state criminal charges over his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election and retention of classified documents. He is currently on trial in New York, accused of making hush money payments to bury allegations of extramarital affairs. His political action committee, Save America, presidential campaign and other fundraising organizations have spent at least $76.7 million on legal fees over the past two years. Mail-in voting Lara Trump is hoping to encourage Republicans to adopt an election tactic that Trump and many of his supporters view with suspicion: mail-in voting. The former president and his closest allies have long criticized the voting method as being rife with fraud — an unfounded assertion. Sizable contingents of voters rely on this method, and Lara Trump sees value in making it as easy as possible for Trump supporters to cast their ballots. She said she supported a nationwide policy of not counting ballots after Election Day but declined to go into specifics, saying it wasn't her area of \"expertise.\" That strategy is unworkable. States set their own election laws, and many rely on postmarks to determine if a vote was cast in time. That's because it can take days — even weeks — for ballots cast on or before Election Day to arrive in the mail. Get local news delivered to your inbox!",

        "description": "PERSONAL FINANCE",
        "content": "PERSONAL FINANCE Homeowners have been spending more on home renovations in re-cent years, as high interest rates and stubbornly high inflation drove up costs for everything from flooring to refrigerators. The home improvement spree got particularly heated early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when Americans invested to make their homes better suited for remote work and learning. But the home improvement frenzy appears to be cooling. Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies' latest leading indicator of remodeling activity, or LIRA, suggests homeowner spending on renovations and repairs will fall to $449 billion this year. That would represent a roughly 7% drop from 2023. Spending on home remodeling was down 1.2% in the first quarter from a year earlier — the first annual decline in more than a decade. Historically, annual growth in home improvement spending has averaged 5%. Many factors are contributing to the slowdown, including elevated interest rates, stubbornly high inflation and a national home sales slump. Home sales are one of the biggest drivers of spending, with homebuyers typically investing most heavily in upgrades or repairs in the first three years after buying their home. \"Sales are just really critical for a lot of remodeling activity,\" said Abbe Will, a senior researcher at the JCHS. The housing market remains constrained by the inventory of homes on the market, mortgage rates and rising prices. Those trends suggest slower home improvement spending growth, at least through the first quarter of 2025, according to the JCHS report. \"We are projecting declines going into the first part of next year, but certainly our trend suggests that we might see a bottom to the market this year,\" Will said. For homeowners considering renovation projects, this means it may be easier to schedule a contractor, but don't bank on lower prices. Costs for construction, remodeling and labor will remain high, Will noted. Here are five ways to help keep a lid on costs in your next home improvement project: 1 Consider home value impact Sometimes less-costly upgrades like a new front door can offer a better return on investment than more expensive projects. A recent analysis by home construction industry tracker Zonda found that upgrading the outside features of a home, such as a garage door or front entrance, typically helps boost a property's resale value and the project's return on investment, or ROI. \"When it comes to adding resale value to a home, exterior replacement projects continue to make the most sense,\" said Clay DeKorne, chief editor of Zonda's JLC Group. \"Discretionary projects like an upscale bathroom or kitchen remodel will feel valuable to those who make the selections but won't provide nearly as much return to sellers.\" 2 Shop around Some projects, like painting a room, you may be able to do yourself. Major renovations will require more leg work to find the right contractor and get estimates on building materials, appliances or other needs. The more you know upfront, the better prepared you'll be to anticipate any potentially costly snags. 3 Factor plenty of time Delays happen. It could be a surprise repair detour when demolishing a wall to expand a bathroom in an older home, or the light fixture or window style you want isn't available for several weeks. Factor in more time than you think you'll need. 4 Prioritize maintenance Replacing siding or water-proofing the wood on an outdoor deck may not be the most exciting renovation, but it will save you money in the long run, says Heather Cook, a broker-agent with Real Brokerage in Charlotte, North Carolina. \"You need to take care of these maintenance items because they're going to creep up on you and cost you 10 times as much later,\" she said. 5 Check your insurance coverage Another potential cost you'll want to avoid: Expenses for fixing accidental damage to your home during a renovation. If you hire a contractor to do the work, get proof they're insured. And after the work is done, update your insurer so the upgrades are accounted for in your policy. Most insurers require that homeowners carry insurance for at least 80% of their home's replacement value to ensure full coverage for repairs or rebuilding after a loss, according to the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America.

        "content": "JINAN, China — Shi Mei and her husband earn a decent enough living by growing corn and millet on their small farm in eastern China's Shandong province. In 2021, they diversified by investing in solar energy — signing a contract to mount some 40 panels on their roof to feed energy to the grid. Now, the couple get paid for every watt of electricity they generate, harvesting the equivalent of $10,000 per year that Shi can track through an app on her phone. \"When the sun comes out, you make money,\" Shi said. The Shi family is on the leading edge of a solar boom in China, which has long dominated global solar manufacturing but didn't always install a lot of it at home. That's changing as the government focuses on the urgency of cutting its worst-in-the-world greenhouse gas emissions at the same time it grows its green economy. China wants one-fifth of its power to come from renewables by 2025, and it's offered a wide range of subsidies to local governments and businesses. The push — in both industrial solar and in rooftop installations like Shi's — is working so well that the grid now has more power than it can handle. Shi was fortunate to get in early; some cities across Shandong province, including her village, are halting new rooftop solar installations. Analysts and solar companies say the future remains bright if China can quickly adapt to the oversupply.Companies and utilities are scrambling to build battery capacity to store all of the power being generated. They'd like to see more flexible energy pricing that could shape demand to better match supply. And they'd like technology that makes it easier to start and stop coal power so it's not always the clean energy of solar power that gets \"curtailed\" — in industry jargon — when the grid can't take more supply. \"China has the great potential and opportunity to make its power sector achieve its carbon peak by 2025,\" said Grace Gao, a Climate and Energy senior campaigner at Greenpeace in China. \"I am looking forward to seeing Shandong truly become a leader in renewable energy and showcase its best practices to the rest of China.\" As with many infrastructure projects in China, it is installing solar at breakneck speed and scale. China added 216 gigawatts of solar in 2023, a little over half in large solar farms, according to the country's National Energy Administration. China's total is more than half of what the entire world added last year, according to research from the consultancy Wood Mackenzie. A gigawatt of solar is enough to supply the energy needs of about 320,000 Chinese households for a year, Gao said. Shandong province added about 14 gigawatts of solar in 2023, and the province now has the ability to produce more power than it can use at certain times during the day. It's the leading province for renewable energy capacity, but that also means it's the first to encounter the difficulties of rapid growth. \"Other provinces will also meet these problems, because there will be more and more solar energy,\" said Peng Peng, the secretary general of China New Energy Investment and Financing Alliance, an industry group. After China announced subsidies for both rooftop and industrial solar in 2014, Shandong, with an advanced manufacturing industry, was a good candidate to take the early lead in solar development compared to less populous provinces like Qinghai or Inner Mongolia. Wang Xingyong installs and maintains rooftop solar panels for clients ranging from villagers to factories, and said his business has doubled every year since 2016. \"In the beginning, maybe we'd just do a project for one client, a farmer, and it'd be worth ten thousand yuan, fifty thousand,\" he said. \"Later, we'd do a couple hundred thousand, millions, for just one project.\" The business model varies, but many companies like Wang's solicit villagers and factories for the chance to use their roofs. Villagers buy the systems and get payouts from selling the electricity to the grid. Wang gets paid to build and maintain the solar setups for factories that use the electricity they generate. Wang said the concept was a hard sell at first, with few people believing the government would pay them for generating electricity. Wang said he slowly won people over, starting with his family and friends, putting forward the money for the equipment himself, and then moving on to other villages with the results. While pitching, few talk about big concepts like the country's target to ensure carbon emissions peak at 2030. It comes down to cash in people's pockets. Shi, the farmer, said her neighbors installed solar panels on their roofs after seeing her investment do well. \"Compared to just putting your money in a savings account, the rate of return is higher,\" she said. A second model allows families to basically get paid rent to allow solar to be installed on their roof — as much as 3,000 yuan ($414) a month, said Liu Wenping, an investor in solar companies. They might also get a free air conditioner or refrigerator as an extra incentive, and get a small percentage from the electricity sold. Chinese battery companies, EV manufacturers and utilities are all racing to develop more advanced batteries to store the electricity from solar panels. Batteries are getting cheaper, but still affect the overall model's profitability. The Shandong provincial government is running a pilot program in Dezhou with lithium iron phosphate batteries that can store power during peak production and feed it to the province's grid later as needed.

        "content": "Consumer labels designed to help Americans pick smart devices that are less vulnerable to hacking could begin appearing on products before the holiday shopping season, federal officials said. Under the new U.S. Cyber Trust Mark Initiative, manufacturers can affix the label on their products if they meet federal cybersecurity standards. The types of devices eligible for labels include baby monitors, home security cameras, fitness trackers, refrigerators and other internet-connected appliances. The White House first announced the \"Cyber Trust\" labels last year and the Federal Communications Commission finalized the details in March, clearing the way for the labels to start showing up later this year. The labels will also include QR codes that consumers can scan for security information about their devices. Officials have likened the labels to the Energy Star program, which rates appliances' energy efficiency. HOME SALES: Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank last month, pushed down by high mortgage rates and rising prices. The National Association of Realtors reported that existing home sales fell 1.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.14 million from a revised 4.22 million in March. VEHICLE AGE: Cars, trucks and SUVs in the U.S. keep getting older, hitting a record average age of 12.6 years in 2024 as people hang on to their vehicles largely because new ones cost so much, according to S&P Global Mobility, which tracks state vehicle registration data. The average vehicle age grew by two months. Get local news delivered to your inbox!",

        "content": "Like many of us, Jessica Peoples has heard the warnings about excessive screen time at night. Still, she estimates spending 30 to 60 minutes on her phone before going to sleep, mostly scrolling through social media. \"Recently, I've been trying to limit the amount,\" says Peoples, a discrimination investigator with the state of New Jersey. \"I do notice that how much time I spend affects how long it takes to fall asleep.\" More than half of Americans spend time on their phones within an hour of going to sleep, according to a survey by the National Sleep Foundation. That's the very latest we should shut off devices, experts say. The brain needs to wind down long before bedtime to get the restorative deep sleep that helps the body function, said Melissa Milanak, an associate professor at Medical University of South Carolina specializing in sleep health. \"You wouldn't take a casserole out of the oven and stick it right in the fridge. It needs to cool down,\" Milanak said. \"Our brains need to do that, too.\" Upending your bedtime routine may not be easy, but insufficient sleep has long been linked to anxiety, obesity and other negative outcomes. Research shows smartphones are particularly disruptive to the circadian clock that regulates sleep and other hormones. \"There are a million and one ways screens create problems with sleep,\" said Lisa Strauss, a licensed psychologist specializing in cognitive behavioral treatment of sleep disorders. The brain, she said, processes electric light — not just a smartphone's much-maligned blue light — as sunshine. That suppresses melatonin production, delaying deep sleep. Even very little bright-light exposure in bed has an impact. It's not just the light that keeps you up Of course, doomscrolling through the news, checking emails or being tempted by ever more tailored videos on social media has its own consequences. So-called \"technostress\" amps you up — possibly even triggering the brain's fl ight or flight response. And algorithms designed to be engaging compel many social media users to scroll longer than they intended. \"Now it's 30 minutes later, when you wanted to watch a couple videos and fall asleep,\" Milanak said. Though much of the scientific research on online media focuses on adolescents and young adults, Strauss said most of her clients struggling with insomnia are middle-aged. \"People go down these rabbit holes of videos, and more and more people are getting hooked,\" she said. How to break the habit The issue is not just curtailing phone use in bed, but phone use at night. That means redesigning your routine, particularly if you use your phone as a way to decompress. It helps to create replacement behaviors that are rewarding. An obvious contender is reading a physical book (e-readers are better than phones but still cast artificial light). Milanak also suggests using that hour before bed to take a warm bath, listen to a podcast, make school lunches for the next day, spend time with family or call a relative in another time zone. \"Make a list of things you like that never get done. That's a great time to do stuff that doesn't involve screens,\" she said. Using a notepad to write down the to-do list for the next day helps keep you from ruminating in bed. Do those activities in another room to train yourself to associate the bed with falling asleep. If there's no other private refuge at home, \"establish a distinct microenvironment for wakefulness and sleep,\" Strauss said. That could mean sitting on the other side of the bed to read, or even just turning the other way around with your feet at the headboard. Finally, sequester the phone in another room, or at least across the room. \"Environmental control can work better than will power, especially when we're tired,\" she said. What if stopping doesn't feel realistic? There are ways to reduce the harm. Setting the phone on night mode at a scheduled time every day is better than nothing, as is reducing screen brightness every night. Hold the phone far from your face and at an oblique angle to minimize the strength of the light. Minimize tempting notifications by putting the phone on do not disturb, which can be adjusted to allow calls and messages from certain people — say, an ailing parent or a kid off at university — to go through. But none of these measures give you carte blanche to look at whatever you want at night, Strauss said. She also recommended asking yourself why checking social media has become your late-night reward. \"Think about the larger structure of the day,\" she said. Everyone deserves solitary moments to relax, but \"maybe be more self-indulgent earlier so you have what you need.\" Get local news delivered to your inbox!",

        "content": "TEHRAN, Iran — Iran's acting President Mohammad Mokhber addressed the country's new parliament Monday in his first public speech since last week's helicopter crash that killed his predecessor and seven others. His speech came as Iran prepares for a presidential election to replace the late Ebrahim Raisi in just a month, a vote that could see the previously behind-thescenes bureaucrat potentially run alongside others. Meanwhile, Iran's new hard-line parliament is expected to select its new speaker Tuesday. In his remarks, Mokhber praised Raisi's time in office, noting that Iran's crude oil production— a key source of hard currency for the country — climbed to more than 3.6 million barrels a day. That comes after Oil Minister Javad Owji said Sunday that Iran was now exporting around 2 million barrels a day, despite Western sanctions targeting the Islamic Republic. Mokhber also asserted that the country's economy remained stable under Raisi when Iran took military actions in Iraq, Israel and Pakistan in recent months. \"Three countries were hit. We hit Israel, people find that figures and indexes are the same in the morning when they wake up, price of hard currency is the same, infl ation is the same, liquidity is the same and the market is full of people's needs,\" Mokhber claimed. \"This strength, this settlement and this power is not a usual thing, they all were because of guidance by the supreme leader and the sincere eff orts of Ayatollah Raisi.\" The Iranian rial has tumbled from a rate of 32,000 rials to $1 at the time of Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Today, it stands around 580,000 to $1 in the wake of the U.S.' unilateral withdrawal from the accord and a series of attacks on shipping in the Mideast, first attributed to Iran and later involving Yemen's Houthi rebels as Israel's war against Hamas on the Gaza Strip began over seven months ago. Also on Monday, during his weekly press briefing, Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said despite Raisi's death, his country's support of \"the oppressed people of Palestine and resistance groups (pursuing) the unalienable rights of the Palestinians to the liberation of their land and standing against the usurping Zionist regime\" would carry on as usual. Kanaani also said eff orts to lift sanctions against the Islamic Republic would continue. \"There has been no change in the approach or the structure of our indirect talks (with the U.S.) within the framework of negotiations to remove unfair sanctions. We will continue diplomatic effort within the same framework and with the same approach.\" Hundreds of entities and people in Iran accused of materially supporting Iran's Revolutionary Guard and foreign militant groups such as Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are sanctioned mainly by the U.S. On May 20, rescuers recovered the bodies of Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and others in a mountainous region in northwestern Iran following a fatal helicopter crash. Iran will hold presidential elections on June 28 to replace Raisi. Meanwhile, Monday marked the first day for Iran's newly elected parliament. Get local news delivered to your inbox!",

        "content": "Fast food has long been a staple of American diets because it is — or was — so inexpensive. However, over the past five years, prices for popular menu items at chains like McDonald's and Taco Bell rose dramatically. The cost of a Big Mac or a Chalupa doubled since 2019, according to archived and current pages of the Fast Food Menu Prices online tracker. Restaurant inflation overall has been significant but much tamer by comparison, with dining-out prices up 30% on average since 2019. Between 2019 and 2024, the price of a medium fries order more than doubled from $1.79 to $4.79, and the price of a Big Mac Meal went from $5.99 to $12.69, according to the tracker at Fastfoodmenuprices.com . A BLT Footlong at Subway went from $5.50 to $8.49. A chicken burrito at Chipotle went from $6.50 to $10.70. As consumer angst boils over, fast-food sales are declining as customers look elsewhere for convenient meals. \"Across almost all major markets, industry traffic is slowing,\" McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski told analysts last month. \"We know our customers are looking for reliable everyday value now more than ever.\" In response, McDonald's recently announced it will add a $5 value menu, and Wendy's countered with a $3 breakfast deal. Both, however, will be around for just a limited time. About 90% of McDonald's locations in the U.S. have an ongoing $4 meal deal. Customers also can find deals in fast-food apps that companies rolled out as loyalty programs; some off er low-priced or free items for signing up. Subway, Chipotle and Taco Bell did not respond to a request for comment on higher prices. Fast-food executives point to increased wages and higher costs for ingredients as the cause for higher drive-thru bills in recent years. Individual franchisees typically have control over their pricing, which can vary widely across the country based on local wages. McDonald's said its restaurant profit margins returned to 2019 levels just as the price McDonald's pays for burgers, buns and wrappers fell to levels seen before the COVID-19 pandemic. It's the higher wages that are now propping up prices, Kempczinski said. Taco Bell has been able to sell more Crunchwraps, and keep profits afloat, despite higher prices for many menu items. About a third of recent transactions at Taco Bell now contain an item from the $3-and-under Cravings menu. \"You're seeing some low-income consumers fall off in the industry,\" said David Gibbs, CEO of Yum! Brands, which owns Taco Bell, KFC and other chains. \"We're not seeing that at Taco Bell.\" Gibbs told investors earlier this month that KFC, meanwhile, \"has been struggling.\" Get local news delivered to your inbox!",

        "content": "LAS VEGAS — They operate in places like an airport, a resort and a distribution center, tucked away from the public eye but close enough for easy access. They often emit laughter — and the sound of tumbling blocks, bouncing balls and meandering tricycles. They're child care centers based at workplaces. And in the fraught American child care landscape, they are popping up more frequently. Skyrocketing child care costs and staffing shortages have complicated arrangements for working parents. Some have left jobs after struggling to find quality care. Employers, in turn, view their entry into the child care realm as both a competitive advantage and a workplace morale booster. \"In the absence of government intervention and investment, a lot of businesses have been stepping up to make sure that their employees can access affordable child care,\" says Samantha Melvin, an assistant research professor at the Erikson Institute, an independent graduate school for early childhood education. Parents benefiting from child care at their work sites praise its convenience and affordability. Frances Ortiz, who works in accounting at The Venetian Resort Las Vegas, can't imagine a better option. She says her 3-year-old daughter has gained independence and language skills — with mom not far away — at the property's on-site child care center for employees. \"She runs in here,\" Ortiz says. \"She grabs my badge. She has to open the door for herself.\" In September, the Pittsburgh International Airport added an on-site child care. The center serves children of Allegheny County Airport Authority employees as well as those of select airport workers, such as food and beverage workers, ground handlers, and wheelchair attendants. Airport officials say the idea stemmed from wanting to bring more women and people of color into the aviation workforce. Plus, the airport sits 17 miles outside of downtown Pittsburgh, making child care logistics challenging for employees. So far, it's operating at about half capacity. \"It's certainly an important proof point to our team that we mean it when we say that we're invested in them and in what they need,\" says Christina Cassotis, CEO of the Allegheny County Airport Authority, which operates the airport. Child care costs can eclipse rent or mortgages, if parents can access care in the first place. Many find themselves on waitlists. Experts caution against an overreliance on businesses filling the void. Philip Fisher, director of the Stanford Center on Early Childhood, says doing so could undercut eff orts to recognize child care as a public good. \"There's a lot of well-intentioned people who are thinking this is a really good idea, and for those who would benefit from it, it could be,\" he says. \"Again, there are lots of downsides even in the short term.\" One of those potential pitfalls, he says, is instability if a parent suddenly loses their job and then has to find new child care and a new job. The assistance offered by public and private employers runs the gamut. Some run their own centers. Others outsource the operations and management. The financial arrangements also differ. Many companies and organizations don't disclose the exact discounts offered to employees. Walmart, for instance, recently opened an on-site child care center at its massive Bentonville, Arkansas, campus. The Little Squiggles Children's Enrichment Center charges a monthly rate of $1,117 to $1,258, based on the child's age, which company officials tell the Monitor in an email is \"at market rate or below regional levels for comparable care.\" Another method gaining steam: employers providing subsidies for families to use toward child care options within their own communities. KinderCare, a large child care operator with locations nationally, partners with more than 600 businesses and organizations to provide employee-sponsored child care, up from 400 in 2019, says Dan Figurski, president of KinderCare for Employers and Champions. Those employers represent the technology, medical, banking, academic, and public service industries, among others. In Nevada, The Venetian Resort's child care center, run by KinderCare, sits in a back-ofhouse hallway steps away from the Las Vegas Boulevard. All employees can enroll their children, as long as space allows, at a cost that's generally 35% to 40% lower than KinderCare's normal rate, says Matt Krystofiak, the Venetian's chief human resources officer. The company also offers subsidies for employees who want to enroll their children in an off-site KinderCare closer to their homes. \"We're doing this because this is what our team members want,\" Krystofiak says. \"This is what our team members need.\" Some businesses view investments in child care as a reflection of their company culture. Patagonia's foray into child care began in 1983 when some of the company's original employees started having children. As the clothing retailer grew, so did its child care footprint. Nowadays, it operates three child care centers — two in southern California and one in Reno, Nevada — serving roughly 200 children. The company charges employees in each location what leaders describe as an \"average market rate.\" Subsidies are available based on household income, says Sheryl Shushan, Patagonia's director of global family services. The child care teachers are employed by Patagonia, so they receive corporate benefits as well. At the outdoor classroom at Patagonia's distribution center in Reno, children spend hours digging in sand, riding bikes, playing with water, or climbing natural and human-made objects. Patagonia leaders say the benefits on their end are stronger employee retention, a can-do spirit in the workplace, and a greater sense of community. For Alyssa Oldham, a classroom manager in Reno, the job and child care benefit meant rethinking her family size. She and her husband originally envisioned being a one child family, given child care costs. Now she comes to work with her 4-year-old son and 1-year-old daughter. \"Working here, I was like, 'We could have another child,'\" she says. Get local news delivered to your inbox!",

        "content": "There was a surge in inflation, and that has prompted central banks around the world to raise interest rates. While this is a necessary step to combat rising prices, it casts a shadow of uncertainty over the booming tech industry. Startups, the lifeblood of technological innovation, are heavily reliant on venture capital and debt financing to fuel their growth. Let’s discuss how rising interest rates could create a funding squeeze, impacting the ability of startups to thrive and potentially hindering the overall progress of the tech sector. What Is The Funding Squeeze? The rising interest rates cause two-sided damage to startups that are seeking funding options. As interest rates climb, the cost of borrowing money for startups increases significantly. This directly impacts startups that rely on debt financing to fuel expansion, such as taking out loans for equipment purchases, hiring talent, or marketing campaigns. With higher interest rates, the cost of servicing these loans becomes more burdensome, potentially eating into profits and limiting future investments. Higher loan payments can strain a startup’s already tight cash flow. This can force them to make tough decisions, such as delaying critical investments, reducing marketing spend, or even laying off employees, all of which can hinder growth and innovation. Rising interest rates don’t just affect loans; they also influence investor behavior. When interest rates rise, investors tend to become more risk-averse. This means they might be less willing to invest in high-growth startups with unproven track records and a higher risk profile. Venture capitalists might become more selective, focusing their investments on established companies with a clearer path to profitability. With a safer alternative available (investments with guaranteed returns due to higher interest rates), investors might shift their focus towards less risky ventures. This could lead to a decline in funding available for early-stage startups with innovative ideas but limited financial history. The combined effect of increased borrowing costs and investor caution creates a funding squeeze for startups, making it more challenging to secure the capital needed to achieve their growth potential. The Impact On The Growth Of A Startup The funding squeeze caused by rising interest rates can have a major ripple effect on a startup’s growth pace. You might be wondering how it is associated. With tighter access to capital, startups might have to scale back on their growth ambitions. This could lead to delays in crucial investments needed for expansion. Hiring talented people is essential for a startup’s growth. However, rising interest rates can force startups to delay or even reduce hiring plans. This can hinder their ability to develop products, scale operations, and reach new markets. Product development is a cornerstone of success for any tech startup. However, with limited funds, startups might be forced to delay product features, postpone product launches, or even shelve promising R&D projects altogether. Rising interest rates can fundamentally shift a startup’s focus. Previously, the tech industry prioritized rapid user acquisition and growth, even if it meant operating at a loss. However, with the funding squeeze, profitability becomes paramount. Startups will likely prioritize strategies that generate revenue quickly, potentially sacrificing aggressive user growth tactics. We might see changes in how startups generate revenue. Subscription models with recurring income could become more prevalent compared to freemium models that prioritize user base first and monetization later. Startups might also explore alternative pricing strategies or premium features to increase their revenue streams. To maintain financial stability, startups might have to implement cost-cutting measures. This could involve renegotiating contracts with vendors, streamlining operations, or even resorting to layoffs. While these measures can help improve cash flow, they can also impact employee morale and potentially hinder innovation in the long run. Can Tech Adapt? Or Will Tech Adapt? While rising interest rates pose a significant challenge, the tech industry is known for its resilience and resourcefulness. Tech startups are inherently innovative and adaptable. They often operate with lean structures and are adept at finding creative solutions to problems. This adaptability will be crucial in finding new methods to guarantee the security of funding and deal with the challenges of a tighter financial sector. Many tech startups address real-world problems and offer compelling value propositions. During economic downturns, companies with solutions that demonstrably improve efficiency or add significant value are likely to attract investors even in a risk-averse environment. With traditional funding avenues becoming more restrictive, startups might explore alternative sources. Platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo allow startups to raise capital directly from the public. Besides, if you have extra bucks, you can diversify your investment, for example, by creating a tool like Bit sprix AI that offers real-time data feed for the investors. This option can be a good deal for startups with innovative products or passionate user communities. High-net-worth individuals looking for high-growth potential might still be interested in investing in promising startups. Collaboration with established companies can provide access to funding, resources, and market reach. Startups can explore joint ventures, licensing agreements, or revenue-sharing models with larger companies. This method involves relying on internal resources and revenue generation to fund growth. Startups might become more focused on achieving profitability earlier and utilizing their own funds for expansion. These methodologies emphasize building a minimum viable product (MVP), testing it with users, and iterating rapidly. This will further allow startups to validate their thoughts and potential market fit with limited resources. By leveraging their inherent adaptability, exploring alternative funding avenues, and embracing bootstrapping and lean methodologies, tech startups can navigate the challenges of rising interest rates and emerge stronger as a result. Final Thoughts The rise in interest rates presents a significant hurdle for startups, tightening the grip on their access to capital. Increased borrowing costs and investor caution create a funding squeeze, potentially hindering the growth trajectory of these innovative companies. However, the tech industry is not without its advantages. Startups are known for their adaptability and resourcefulness. By focusing on innovation, value creation, and efficient resource allocation, they can potentially find new ways to navigate the funding squeeze. Exploring alternative funding sources like crowdfunding, angel investors, or strategic partnerships can also provide some relief. Additionally, a return to bootstrapping and lean startup methodologies might become more common as startups prioritize building sustainable and profitable businesses. In conclusion, while rising interest rates pose undeniable challenges, the tech industry’s ability to adapt and innovate should not be underestimated. By embracing resourcefulness and exploring alternative avenues of growth, startups can emerge stronger and more efficient. The future of tech startups in a higher interest rate environment will likely be marked by a shift towards profitability, a focus on genuine value creation, and the exploration of creative solutions to overcome funding hurdles. This period of economic uncertainty could ultimately foster a more resilient and sustainable tech ecosystem in the long run.",

        "description": "TRADE | ANALYSIS",
        "content": "TRADE | ANALYSIS WASHINGTON — As president, Donald Trump imposed a 25% tariff on foreign steel, which hurt Clips & Clamps Industries, a Michigan auto supplier — raising its materials prices, making it harder to compete with overseas rivals and costing it several contracts. Jeff Aznavorian, the company president, thought he might enjoy relief once Joe Biden entered the White House. Instead, Biden largely preserved Trump's tariff s — on steel, aluminum and a mass of goods from China. \"It was a little surprising that an ideologically different administration would keep the policies so intact,'' Aznavorian said. Trump and Biden agree on essentially nothing, from taxes to immigration. Yet on trade, they have embraced surprisingly similar approaches. Which means that whether Biden or Trump wins the presidency, the United States seems poised to maintain a protectionist trade policy. This month, in fact, Biden announced some new tariff s, on Chinese electric vehicles, advanced batteries and other products, that he said would keep Beijing from flooding the United States with cheap imports. The protectionist tilt reflects the widespread view that opening the nation to more imports — especially from China — wiped out American manufacturing jobs,, a potent topic in the Midwestern industrial states that will likely decide who wins the White House. \"If you look at the election, it's obvious,'' said William Reinsch, a former trade official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"Where are the deciding states? Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin — right there, you can see that trade is going to have an outsize role.'' In their own ways, the two candidates have ditched a U.S.commitment to frictionless trade — low barriers and scant government interference — that were a bedrock of American policy after World War II. Yet trade protectionism carries economic risks. It can raise costs as the nation struggles to tame inflation. It can prop up inefficient companies. It provokes retaliation against American exports. And it sours relations with allies and adversaries alike. Trump, who brazenly labeled himself \"Tariff Man,'' tried to pummel America's trading partners with import taxes, vowing to shrink America's trade deficits, especially with China. He did pressure Mexico and Canada into rewriting a North American trade deal that Trump insisted had destroyed U.S. manufacturing jobs. He also persuaded China to agree to buy more American farm goods. But his efforts didn't revive the manufacturing base — factory jobs make up a smaller share of U.S. employment than they did before his presidency — or permanently shrink America's trade deficits. Trump has vowed more of the same in a second term — a 10% tariff on all imports and a 60% tax on Chinese goods. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, warns that Trump's tariff plans \"would spark higher inflation, reduce GDP and jobs and increase unemployment, all else equal.\" A year after the import taxes were imposed, Zandi estimates, average consumer prices would be 0.7 percentage points higher than they would otherwise be. Biden favors subsidizing such U.S. key industries as chipmaking and EV manufacturing to give them a competitive edge. It's a stance that reflects worry that China's rising military and technological might imperils America's national security. As the rcecent announcement showed, Biden isn't averse to new tariffs, either. \"The laissez-faire economic model of trade wasn't working for the United States,'' said Elizabeth Baltzan, a senior adviser to U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai. \"We want to correct for that. The measures you take in order to get a fairer (economy) may involve measures that could be labeled protectionist.'' Dani Rodrik, a Harvard economist who was an early critic of globalization, views Biden trade policies more favorably than he does Trump's approach. \"Trump's was knee-jerk and incoherent; there is little evidence that his trade restrictions on China did any good to workers or the middle class in the U.S.,'' Rodrik said. By contrast, he said, \"Biden's approach is strategic and based on rebuilding U.S. manufacturing capacity and investing in the green transition, so fundamentally strengthening the U.S. economy rather than crass protectionism.\" Either way, a consensus has formed in recent years that U.S. trade policy had to change. David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and two colleagues concluded that from 1999 to 2011, cheap Chinese imports wiped out 2.4 million American jobs. More recently, China's rise as America's No. 1 geopolitical rival has created a bipartisan effort to reduce America's reliance on Beijing for supplies of everything from pharmaceuticals to \"rare earth'' minerals used in electric cars and cellphones. The sea change in policy started with Trump. One of his first presidential acts was to dump a free trade agreement the Obama administration had negotiated with 11 Pacific Rim countries. Then Trump imposed taxes on foreign washing machines, solar panels, aluminum and steel. Finally, he hammered $360 billion of Chinese products with tariffs for Beijing's efforts to surpass U.S. technological supremacy through illicit tactics. China lashed back with retaliatory taxes. Did Trump's tariff war achieve anything? A study by Autor and three colleagues concluded that Trump's import taxes failed in their goal to return jobs to the American heartland. The tariffs, the study found, \"neither raised nor lowered U.S. employment'' where they were supposed to protect jobs. If Trump's trade war fizzled as policy, though, it succeeded as politics. Autor's study found that support for Trump and Republicans rose in the industrial areas most exposed to the import tariffs. After entering office, Biden retained many of Trump's trade policies. He made no effort to revive Obama's old Pacific Rim trade pact. He kept Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs, while letting some trading partners avoid them until they reached a quota. He retained the China tariffs. Biden turned up the heat on Beijing by restricting its access to advanced computer chips and the equipment to make them. The United States seems unlikely to reverse its move toward protectionism anytime soon. China, struggling to revive its own economy, is trying to export its way out of trouble, threatening to overwhelm world markets with cheap EVs and other products. When it comes to China and other U.S. adversaries, Aznavorian said, he's convinced that protectionist trade policies are \"definitely here to stay.'' Get local news delivered to your inbox!",

        "content": "SHIPPENSBURG – East Pennsboro's Breckin Swope made a promise to Panther alumnus Payton Morris, the 2018 PIAA Class 3A pole vault champion who recruited Swope to pick up a pole and try the event many years ago. He promised he wouldn't walk around wearing a medal unless it was state gold. And so Breckin Swope stood on the Seth Grove Stadium infield Friday afternoon, silver medal in hand, after the final competition of his high school career on the first day of the PIAA Track and Field Championships. Swope, the Class 3A runner-up, cleared 15 feet, 6 inches. Lower Dauphin's Drake Risser cleared 16-0 on his first attempt to claim the title. \"It sucks that I never get to wear it around my neck and never get to show it off,\" Swope said of his silver medal, an improvement over the bronze he earned as a junior and a sixth-place finish as a sophomore. \"But it's been cool to jump with the guys one last time.\" Swope's pole vault silver headlined the first day of the state meet for Sentinel-area athletes. Trinity's Jeremiah Hargrove earned a trip to the medal stand with a fourth-place finish in the Class 2A javelin, the Cumberland Valley and Carlisle boys earned berths in Saturday's 4x100-meter relay final, and West Perry's Marcus Quaker qualified for the Class 3A boys 300-meter hurdles final. SILVER FOR SWOPE Swope, who came into the competition with the bar at 15-0, cleared that and 15-6 on his first two attempts. Risser, the Mid-Penn champion and Palmyra's Mason Bucks, another Mid-Penn standout who won District 3 Class 3A Saturday, were the only other competitors left. The triumvirate had occupied the medal stand together throughout the last two years, and the order for Friday's state championship would be determined at 16-0. Risser made it. Swope and Bucks both clipped the bar on their first attempts. Swope opted to pass on his final two attempts at 16-0 in an all-or-nothing attempt to go for the gold. \"Some people settle for second,\" Swope said. \"I'm not that kind of guy. I've never been that kind of guy. I don't think I'll ever be that kind of guy. He made it, and I feel like I'm the guy who, when there's more pressure, I stand out.\" Bucks missed his remaining attempts at 16-0. Risser and Swope attacked the bar at 16-6. Neither could clear it on their remaining attempts, sealing their placements on the podium. \"I've got to be grateful,\" said Swope, who plans to continue his vaulting career at Penn State – along with Bucks – while pursuing a career in physical education. \"I know I can't be too upset about myself because not too many people in this world get to say they got second place at a state meet.\" HARGROVE'S BIG OPENER Hargrove, making his first trip to the state meet since 2022 and his first as a javelin thrower, opened with a mark of 188-10. It was the leading distance through one round of throws before Danville Area's Bronson Krainak took the lead and never looked back with his second throw that went a winning distance of 215-7. Central Columbia's Lincoln Huber sealed second place with a mark of 193-9, and Minersville Area's Luke Stevenosky hit 193-1 on his third throw of the trials for third place. \"It was really satisfying knowing that I got to come here and compete with the best people in the state,\" Hargrove said. \"Fourth place was maybe not the outcome I wanted, but, hey, I'm just glad to be here again.\" In his attempt to catch the leaders, Hargrove launched a consistent series of throws on his next four attempts that ranged from 176-0 to 183-4. His final attempt, an all-or-nothing effort, hit 168-8. \"As I went into it, I was just thinking, 'Keep going. Keep pushing. It's all right if I don't get a bigger throw,'\" he said. \"I stayed consistent, which I'm happy about.\" It's been a season of consistent progress for Hargrove, who worked with new Trinity throws coach Issy Stence and extended his range throughout the season. \"It shows a lot of progress, coming from throwing 170 earlier in the year to 180 to 189,\" Hargrove said. \"It's a lot, and that just doesn't come out of nowhere. It takes practice and time and effort, and I'm really happy with that.\" SCHOOL RECORD FOR SHORE In Friday's only track final of the day, the 1,600-meter run, Trinity's Lila Shore finished second in the opening second and 10th overall in Class 2A, clocking in at five minutes, 12.65 seconds to break her own school record. Carlisle's Ana Bondy broke the five-minute mark (4:59.05) to take 15th place in the Class 3A girls final, and Cumberland Valley's Andrew Hampton finished 30th overall in the Class 3A boys final at 4:24.33. The Class 3A boys champion, Butler's Drew Griffith broke the meet and national records with a time of 3:57.08. EAGLE, HERD RELAYS ADVANCE Ke'Aune Green felt good about his performance in the Class 3A boys 100-meter dash trials that saw two sprinters break the meet record. Green finished third in his heat and ninth overall at 10.71 seconds, a personal record that broke the Cumberland Valley school record he had broken six days earlier in the District 3 finals. \"I was just a little disappointed that I didn't qualify for finals,\" he said. \"Other than that, it was perfect.\" Green carried that disappointment as fuel when he received the baton from teammate Seth Beardsley in the final exchange of the 4x100-meter relay trials almost two hours later. Green shot past the two sprinters ahead of him and surged to the finish line to give the Eagles – who also had contributions from Rukie Efeturi and Owen Bramblett – the win in 42.31 and a spot in Saturday's final. \"I just knew that we wanted to go to finals,\" Green said, \"and if we would have finished in third, we probably wouldn't have. I had to get up there and get first.\" Green said he felt first place open up to him about 25 meters into his 100-meter segment. \"Once I saw myself catching them,\" he said, \"I was like, 'All right, this is going to be good.' I knew we were going to get some good time.\" Carlisle's Darian Crim, Parker Smith, Paulie Pretopapa and Javani Mosley followed their Cumberland County rivals to the finals with a second-place finish in the ensuing heat at a qualifying time, and a school record, of 42.36. The Herd quartet had tied the previous record of 42.49 at the Mid-Penn championships. \"We've been on that 4x1 record, like, the whole year,\" Smith said, \"and we knew this could be our last time running it. So we told each other that if we drop the baton, we'll at least do it pushing, so we just pushed through, and we got it.\" Crim, Mosley, James Millare and Smith later broke their own school record in the 4x400-meter relay, finishing 101th overall at 3:19.94. TRIALS RECAP Beardsley finished in a tie for 10th place in the Class 3A boys 110-meter hurdles with a time of 14.54 in the trials. The Eagles' Quincey Robertson took 12th place in the Class 3A girls 400-meter dash after running a season-best time of 57.88 in the trials. West Perry's Marcus Quaker qualified for Saturday's Class 3A boys 300-meter hurdles final by posting the third-best time in the field (38.49) and finishing second in his heat to Parkland's Andrew Beers (37.93). District 3 champion Tyler Burgess of Palmyra ran 38.21, the second-fastest time overall. Northern's Annika Barrett finished 16th overall in the Class 3A girls 300-meter hurdles at 45.99. She joined Alexa Rank, Anna Lehman and Cassidy Brunner in a ninth-place finish in the Class 3A girls 4x400-meter relay (3:56.20). Cumberland Valley's Jilana Graziano, Catherine Tiday, Greta Dwyer and Robertson finished 16th (4:00.95). The Eagle boys – Kern Singh, Matthew Stier, Khish Patel and Beardsley finished 14th in the Class 3A boys 4x400 at 3:23.94. FIELD NOTES A trio of Trinity high jumpers competed on the infield Friday. In the afternoon's Class 2A boys competition, the Shamrocks' Jaydon Gist cleared 6-0 to finish 16th overall. Earlier, Trinity senior Julianna Prokop cleared 4-10 to finish 19th overall while teammate Ashley Berkheimer missed 4-10, the opening height, in the final attempts of her sophomore season. Before contributing to the Thundering Herd's record run in the 4x100, Smith finished 13th overall in the Class 3A boys triple jump with a mark of 43-4. Teammate Xavier Campbell finished his junior season with 21st place and a mark of 424.25. Both Carlisle jumpers had their days' best marks on their final attempts. In the throwing circle Friday, Mechanicsburg's Maria Clark took 12th place in the Class 3A girls shot put, hitting 37-1.5, her best mark of the day, with her final throw. Trinity's Emma Holloway landed a mark of 110-0 in the Class 2A girls discus to also finish 12th. Northern's Spencer Siegel, another thrower making his state shot put debut, rounded out his series with a mark of 48-6.75 to finish 20th in the Class 3A boys competition. West Perry's Caleb Gutshall fouled on all three of his attempts. The state championship meet continues Saturday with the remainder of track and field finals scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. Tim Gross is the sports editor at The Sentinel and cumberlink.com .

        "content": "EDITOR'S NOTE — This story includes a discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org . Grayson Murray's parents said Sunday their 30-year-old son took his own life, just one day after he withdrew from a PGA Tour event. The family asked for privacy and that people honor Murray by being kind to one another. \"If that becomes his legacy, we could ask for nothing else,\" Eric and Terry Murray said in a statement released by the PGA Tour. Murray, a two-time PGA Tour winner, spoke in January after winning the Sony Open in Honolulu about turning the corner in his life, his golf and battles with alcoholism and mental health. He died Saturday morning. Murray had to go through the Korn Ferry Tour to get his PGA Tour card back. And then he birdied the last hole at the Sony Open to get into a playoff, and made a 40-foot birdie putt on the first extra hole for an emotional win. \"It's not easy,\" Murray said immediately after winning. \"I wanted to give up a lot of times. Give up on myself. Give up on the game of golf. Give up on life, at times.\" Murray tied for 43rd last week in the PGA Championship, which enabled him to hold his position among the top 60 to earn a spot in the U.S. Open next month at Pinehurst No. 2 in his native North Carolina. He shot 68 in the opening round at Colonial. The next round, he was 5 over and coming off three straight bogeys when he withdrew citing an illness. PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan said he spoke with Murray's parents about halting play at Colonial and they insisted the golf tournament continue. Monahan flew to Fort Worth, Texas, to be with players. Many of them wore black-and-red pins on their caps Sunday in honor of Murray. Those are the colors of the Carolina Hurricanes, his favorite NHL team. \"We have spent the last 24 hours trying to come to terms with the fact that our son is gone. It's surreal that we not only have to admit it to ourselves, but that we also have to acknowledge it to the world. It's a nightmare,\" his parents shared in their statement. \"We have so many questions that have no answers. But one. Was Grayson loved? The answer is yes. By us, his brother Cameron, his sister Erica, all of his extended family, by his friends, by his fellow players and — it seems — by many of you who are reading this. He was loved and he will be missed. \"Life wasn't always easy for Grayson, and although he took his own life, we know he rests peacefully now.\" Grayson was a raw talent after taking up golf at age 8. He won his age division three straight years at the prestigious Junior World Championship in San Diego. But he struggled to fit in at college, going to Wake Forest, East Carolina and then Arizona State. His first coach was Ted Kiegel in North Carolina, who like so many others was devastated. \"Words cannot express the tragedy of this moment,\" Kiegel said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \"Grayson came from something that was ordinary and made it EXTRAORDINARY. ... He burned bright for the 30 years he gave us.\" Murray won as a 22-year-old rookie at the Barbasol Championship in Kentucky, and frustration began to set in as he didn't improve as quickly as others whom he routinely beat as amateurs. He was always open about depression and anxiety, and his bouts with alcohol. One of his darker moments was at the Sony Open in 2021 when he was suspended for an incident in a Hawaii bar. Murray took to social media to say, \"Why was I drunk? Because I'm a (expletive) alcoholic that hates everything to do with the PGA Tour life and that's my scapegoat.\" He also accused the tour of not giving him proper help, which the tour denied. Monahan said Saturday at Colonial that he called Murray right after that posting and subsequently spent a lot of time with him. \"I think one of the elements of his legacy is his resiliency,\" Monahan said. \"So you think of going back to 2017, winning the Barbasol Championship, going back and forth between the Korn Ferry Tour and the PGA Tour. ... self-assessing, coming back, becoming in his own eyes a stronger human being, and then winning three times in the past year. \"To me, that's a level of resiliency that is extraordinary.\" Get local news delivered to your inbox!",

        "content": "SHIPPENSBURG — The sun above Shippensburg University Saturday morning bedeviled Mechanicsburg's Maria Clark and the rest of the Class 3A discus throwers throughout their competition on Day 2 of the PIAA Track and Field Championships. But later, when she stood on the Seth Grove Stadium infield's award stand with a shining silver medal around her neck, the Wildcat senior didn't mind soaking in the warmth of the sun and the support of the throwing community around her for a brief final moment. Clark's second-place performance in the Class 3A discus capped her high school throwing career, and it headlined the Sentinel-area girls performances on the final day of the state-championship meet. Trinity's Adeline Woodward tied for sixth place in the Class 2A pole vault, and Carlisle's 4x800-meter relay team finished seventh to round out the local medal-winning performances Saturday. Clark's rise Clark, the District 3 champion who finished eighth in state's Class 3A discus throw as a sophomore in 2022 and fourth as a junior, hit a leading mark of 132 feet, 2 inches. It stood until McCaskey's Genesis Castro took the lead with a throw of 134-11 on her final attempt in the trials. The race was on. \"It was definitely a positive vibe,\" Clark said. \"I know me and Genesis were duking it out. We really love each other and wanted each other to succeed, but we wanted to kick each other's butts.\" Castro capped her gold-medal performance with a final pair of marks that landed at 138-8. Clark wound up for one final throw that felt good out of her hand but landed outside the sector. \"I know I definitely wanted gold,\" Clark said, \"but having moved up each year and progressing, I'm proud of that, even if I didn't get first. Having the big mark in a beginning was definitely a relief.\" Also providing relief was a group of throwers gathered around her, fellow competitors Clark has appreciated getting to know during the course of her career who have helped bring out her personality. After hopping off the award stand Saturday, still in the warm sun at Seth Grove Stadium, Clark shook as many of their hands as she could. \"We're always there to support each other and cheer each other on,\" Clark said, \"and I think that matters more than any medal or distance anyone could ever do.\" Clark also qualified for the state shot put competition for the first time in her career, finishing 12th overall in Friday's event. She plans to continue her throwing career while studying chemistry at Kutztown University. But the finality of her performance Saturday hadn't hit her while she stood in the sun and soaked in the atmosphere. \"It hasn't sunk in yet,\" she said, \"but I know on the van ride home, it will.\" Woodward reflects On the eve of her final high school competition, Woodward's father dared her to wear all of her medals during Trinity's graduation Friday night. The Shamrock obliged. \"I had 20 medals around my neck,\" she said. \"It was really heavy, but it was awesome. It hit me how lucky I am to have these experiences.\" Woodward added one more medal, and one more experience, to her collection. After a miss on her first attempt, she cleared 10-6 and 11-0 on consecutive vaults, securing a tie for sixth place with Knoch's Kara Fennell in an event won for the second year in a row by Bermudian Springs' Lilyana Carlson, who cleared 13-0. Woodward took sixth place in the state competition as a sophomore and earned silver while challenging Carlson for last year's title. She was hoping to clear 12-0 Saturday to match her season-best performance. \"I think I just let the nerves of this being my last meet and the emotion get to me,\" she said. \"But it's OK. I'm not upset about how I did. I'm not going to dwell on it.\" Trust fuels herd Carlisle anchor Ana Bondy wasn't sure what place the Thundering Herd occupied when entered the home stretch of the Class 3A 4x800-meter relay, but she knew some of the teams in the previous section had posted medal-worthy times, and she couldn't afford to lose any ground with the rest of the field closing in on her, including North Penn's Gemma Chevoor. \"I was like, 'If I drop this one place, and if she beats me, we might not medal,'\" Bondy said. \"I hit a wall in that last 100, I was just trying to go to my form, and I tried to out-lean her. I've never out-leaned someone before.\" Chevoor beat Bondy to the line, but the Carlisle junior held off Owen J. Roberts' Jane Kratz for fifth palce in the section and seventh place overall for herself, Emily Leatherman, Sophia Julias and Eliasbeth Bordner at 9:21.22, a school record and the punctuation to a high school season that included Mid-Penn gold and District 3 silver. They broke the Carlisle record of 9:21.79 set in 2019. \"We can all trust each other,\" Bondy said, \"and know that even if I don't have my best race, the rest of them will be there for me.\" The four girls are neighbors in Carlisle and friends off the track. The trust they built helped them hold their own against the top teams in the state, including Upper Dublin, which won the title in 9:01.43. In the open 800-meter finals, Leatherman posted the top local time (2:17.24) to finish 16th overall in Class 3A, just ahead of Northern's Anna Lehman, who finished 18th (2:17.75). Trinity's Lila Shore won the opening section and finished 10th overall in Class 2A with a time of of 2:22.86. Field notes Boiling Springs' Molly Kimmel finished in a tie for 19th place in the Class 3A high jump. She cleared 5-0 on her first attempt and 5 feet, 2 inches after two misses Saturday morning. ... Cumberland Valley's Aubrey Orsinger finished her junior season with a 25th-place finish in the Class 3A javelin with a mark of 105-2.

        "description": "LEADING OFF",
        "content": "LEADING OFF YOUR GUIDE TO THE WEEK IN MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL The Dallas Mavericks are one win away from the NBA Finals, and the Stars are still in the mix for the Stanley Cup. It's enough to push the Texas Rangers — the reigning World Series champions — onto the back burner in the Metroplex. Not that the Rangers have done much to compete for attention lately. In the middle of all that basketball and hockey hoopla, Texas hosts the Arizona Diamondbacks this week in a rematch of the World Series. Both teams are under .500, costing the matchup some of its luster. For the Rangers, injuries to prominent starting pitchers are just part of the problem. Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer haven't pitched at all this year, and Nathan Eovaldi and Jon Gray are on the injured list now as well. Despite all that, Texas' starters have an ERA of 3.65, which is in the top half of baseball. The bullpen, however, has the second-worst ERA in the game at 5.09, with eight blown saves in 17 chances. Offensively, the Rangers were expected to receive a boost from top prospects Evan Carter and Wyatt Langford, but Carter is batting .188. Langford is at .224, and he's currently on the IL. The good news for Texas is that entering Monday's games, only Seattle (28-26) is above .500 in the AL East at the moment, and the Mariners lead the Rangers by just three games. The whole division is in negative territory in terms of run differential. Texas manager Bruce Bochy has shown time and time again that all you need to do is make the playoff s to have a shot at winning it all, and the Rangers have plenty of time left to turn their season around — and try to add to this impressive run for Dallas-area sports. TAKING STOCK Last year, 10 of the 12 teams that were in playoff position as of Memorial Day went on to make the postseason. The year before, it was eight out of 12. A fast start that's lasted this long is generally enough to put a team in very good shape. The postseason odds at FanGraphs already have the Dodgers (98.7%), Phillies (98.6%), Yankees (98.1%) and Braves (95.7%) as near-locks to make the playoff s. The Orioles (88.8%) aren't far behind. Of the teams not currently in playoff position, FanGraphs gives the Astros (53.1%) the best shot to get in. TRIVIA TIME The last two times both defending league champions finished under .500 were in shortened seasons: It happened to the Astros (29-31) and Nationals (2634) in 2020 and the Blue Jays (55-60) and Phillies (54-61) in 1994. When is the last time it happened in a full season? LINE OF THE WEEK Baltimore's Kyle Bradish struck out 11 in seven no-hit innings as the Orioles beat the Chicago White Sox 4-1 on Sunday. Bradish left after 103 pitches and Danny Coulombe immediately allowed a home run to Danny Mendick, but that was the only hit of the game for Chicago. COMEBACK OF THE WEEK Pittsburgh trailed by four runs in the bottom of the ninth against San Francisco last Tuesday night before rallying to tie it. Nick Gonzales then hit an RBI single in the 10th to give the Pirates a 7-6 win. The Giants had a win probability of 99.4% in the ninth, according to Baseball Savant. That was the start of a wild week for San Francisco. The Giants overcame deficits of 5-0 and 6-2 to beat the Pirates in their next two games. Then they beat the Mets after being down 6-2 on Friday night and 2-1 in the ninth inning Saturday. New York finally returned the favor Sunday, scoring three runs in the ninth to beat San Francisco 4-3. TRIVIA ANSWER The Royals beat the Cardinals in the 1985 World Series. In 1986, Kansas City went 76-86 and St. Louis was 79-82. Get local news delivered to your inbox!",

        "content": "Vincent Kompany's likely move to Bayern Munich was initially greeted with ridicule and disbelief. A more balanced view has since emerged but there is no escaping the incredulity when a coach relegated with Burnley is set to walk into one of Europe's biggest jobs. The German giants did not come calling for Sean Dyche when he finished seventh in the Premier League. Their views on Stan Ternent and Steve Cotterill are unconfirmed. But Kompany is regarded as a gamble worth taking, a coach of vast potential. There are many factors involved, not least Bayern's own fraught recruitment process. But choosing Kompany also highlights the changing view of what makes an elite coach, a growing willingness to look beyond results and towards a style that could transfer. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Kompany, it should be acknowledged, has plenty else going for him. As a player, he captained club and country, winning the Premier League with Manchester City under Pep Guardiola. That brings instant respect and a relationship that imbues a certain shine. The trend in modern management is towards those disciples of Guardiola. Mikel Arteta has emerged as his biggest challenger in the Premier League, Xabi Alonso has just triumphed in the Bundesliga. Enzo Maresca has followed Kompany in winning the Championship. The connection with Guardiola, widely regarded as the outstanding coach of his generation, is particularly significant at Bayern. Some frame his work there as unfinished without a Champions League win but he wowed with his ideas. There is a legacy there. For Kompany, other intangibles include his own playing spell at Hamburg - he is a fluent German speaker - and his reputation for being articulate, intelligent and measured. But the top line in all this can hardly be avoided. There is the matter of that relegation. Get Sky Sports Stream big moments with NOW Football features Transfer Centre LIVE! Kompany came into the Premier League wedded to the approach that had helped garner 101 points in the Championship, winning Burnley praise for their enterprising play. They boasted the best attack and the best defence as they stormed to the title. The swiftness with which he transformed the style, after a decade of doing things so differently under Dyche, caught the eye. It was a testament to his ability to manage change that their possession stats were the highest since Championship records began. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player But despite significant investment in the summer, his team were unable to adapt to the Premier League. The passing game that had been too good for the Championship was undone by the speed and skill of those sides at the higher level, soon undermining confidence. The inequality within the Premier League was viewed by some as a mitigating circumstance. But, in the aftermath of a 3-0 defeat at Crystal Palace that would be followed up with a 2-0 home reverse to Bournemouth, Roy Keane had less sympathy for Kompany's side. \"Do you know what, they have been dreadful. They have been dreadful,\" Keane told Sky Sports. \"We talk about teams having a style of play in the Championship and trying to compare it to the Premiership, it is chalk and cheese. It is impossible. \"They look weak physically. The goals they are giving away, it is schoolboy stuff. I admire managers who have a philosophy and a style of play, but you have got to adapt. You have got to give yourself a chance of winning football matches.\" Only two teams in the Premier League made more errors leading to shots than Burnley and the contrast with the risk-free football of the Dyche era became a stick with which to beat him. Thousands more passes brought little reward, only encouraging more mistakes. It is worth noting that even in his first managerial role at Anderlecht, Kompany's methods had been questioned. The attempt to mimic Guardiola had been a concern for some in Belgium, one expressed in strong terms by the former Anderlecht manager Aad de Mos. \"In football, you do not have to copy another coach,\" said De Mos. \"Kompany wants to do the same thing as Guardiola at City and that makes me sick. City have players like Sergio Aguero and Kevin De Bruyne. Anderlecht needs to get by with more modest players.\" Bayern bosses might feasibly agree with that assessment while coming to the opposite conclusion. Perhaps they take the view that they do possess the quality of player capable of delivering this football - they just need someone who is willing and able to coach it. With one of the weakest squads in the Premier League, Kompany floundered. But with one of the best squads in the Championship, he flourished. Bayern's status within the Bundesliga, relative to the rest, is much more akin to the latter than the former. If Kompany struggles then Bayern will be criticised. If he thrives their imagination will be lauded. Whatever happens, Kompany has been vindicated in sticking to his principles. It raises intriguing questions about how coaches should approach their work. Dyche is an obvious contrast but for him it feels more like ideology than compromise. Other examples are more pertinent. Julen Lopetegui and Thomas Frank are two that come to mind - coaches who opted to adapt but now find that could be a mark against them. Lopetegui's appointment at West Ham was met with a lukewarm response. In part, that was because his rescue job with Wolves - lifting them from rock bottom to 13th in the table - was not achieved with the necessary swagger to excite, even if it did save them. Frank played a progressive game to help Brentford win promotion but, unlike Kompany, successfully switched to a more direct style to keep them there. Now, he finds some questioning whether those long throws make him suitable for a role at an elite club. For Kompany, the stain of relegation is more easily erased than a stain on his style. This move shows that coaches, like players, can be upwardly mobile regardless of results. And that a man questioned at Burnley can somehow be seen as the answer for Bayern.

        "content": "The 2024 Minor League Baseball season is in full swing. Here's a look at how Sentinel-area athletes are faring. Benny Montgomery (OF) Team: Hartford Yard Goats (Colorado Rockies, Double-A) Last week's stats: N/A Notes: According to MLB.com 's Thomas Harding, Montgomery underwent left shoulder surgery May 9. In an interview with Colorado Rockies' director of player development Chris Forbes, it was stated the Red Land graduate \"hurt his left shoulder on a dive — dislocated it and did some damage to the shoulder capsule and labrum.\" Forbes added that if Montgomery were to return to the field this year, it would be at the end of the season. The former 2021 first-round selection was batting .283 with four doubles, two home runs and 10 RBIs prior to the injury. Hayden Seig (P) Team: Rocket City Trash Pandas (Los Angeles Angels, Double-A) Last week's stats: 0-0, 3 IP, 4 H, 1 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 2 K Notes: Seig improved his season earned-run average to a 1.21 last week with a pair of strong relief appearances. The Mechanicsburg product threw a combined three innings, scattering four hits on one unearned run while striking out two. Beck Way (P) Team: Northwest Arkansas Naturals (Kansas City Royals, Double-A) Last week's stats: 0-0, 2 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 5 K Notes: Way kept the opposition off-balance last week, tossing two scoreless innings. The Cumberland Valley alumnus allowed one hit in two relief appearances and fanned five batters. His ERA dipped to a 1.33. Michael Morales (P) Team: Everett AquaSox (Seattle Mariners, High-A) Last week's stats: 1-0, 6 IP, 2 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 3 BB, 6 K Notes: Morales delivered another quality start Saturday and picked up his fourth win of the season. The former East Pennsboro ace went six innings, permitting a run on a pair of hits while walking three and punching out six. His record sits at 4-1 through nine starts and his ERA improved to a 2.81. Jake Madden (P) Team: Modesto Nuts (Colorado Rockies, Single-A) Last week's stats: 0-0, 2.1 IP, 2 H, 1 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 1 K Notes: Madden bounced back last week, spinning a sharp 2 1/3 innings. The East Penn grad surrendered two hits and one unearned run in two relief appearances while striking out one. His ERA fell to a 2.89.

        "content": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. — The NFL has awarded the 2026 draft to Pittsburgh with the Steelers ready to tap Pennsylvania's deep football tradition trying to meet the new standard for host cities. League officials announced the decision Wednesday as part of the NFL spring meetings. Owners chose Pittsburgh after reviewing the bid along with the advisory committee. The three-day draft will be held at Point State Park and the Steelers' home at Acrisure Stadium. The NFL set a record with more than 775,000 fans attending the 2024 draft in April in Detroit, and Green Bay will be hosting the 2025 draft at Lambeau Field on April 24-26. Pittsburgh owner Art Rooney II said Detroit and Kansas City helped set a very high bar for hosting one of the NFL's premier events. He said the Steelers look forward to following that tradition tapping into the roots of pro football in a state that sent the likes of Mike Ditka, Dan Marino and Joe Montana to the NFL. \"We think it'll be the largest visitor event in the history of Pittsburgh hosting hundreds of thousands of people and really football fans from all over the country,\" Rooney said. \"Certainly, the Steelers nation from all over the country we think will come for a visit. So we just look forward to hosting that.\" The NFL began rotating its annual draft around the country in 2015 starting in Chicago after holding the event in New York between 1965 and 2014. Philadelphia hosted in 2017 followed by Dallas in 2018, Nashville in 2019, Cleveland in 2021, Las Vegas in 2022 and Kansas City in 2023. The Steelers are excited for Pittsburgh to get its turn at hosting the NFL draft. Long snapper Christian Kunitz can't wait for this opportunity as a Pittsburgh native. \"It's always been in a massive city like Vegas or somewhere like that or just for the Yinzers to experience that, it's going to be awesome,\" Kunitz said.

        "content": "Vincent Kompany's likely move to Bayern Munich was initially greeted with ridicule and disbelief. A more balanced view has since emerged but there is no escaping the incredulity when a coach relegated with Burnley is set to walk into one of Europe's biggest jobs. The German giants did not come calling for Sean Dyche when he finished seventh in the Premier League. Their views on Stan Ternent and Steve Cotterill are unconfirmed. But Kompany is regarded as a gamble worth taking, a coach of vast potential. There are many factors involved, not least Bayern's own fraught recruitment process. But choosing Kompany also highlights the changing view of what makes an elite coach, a growing willingness to look beyond results and towards a style that could transfer. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Kompany, it should be acknowledged, has plenty else going for him. As a player, he captained club and country, winning the Premier League with Manchester City under Pep Guardiola. That brings instant respect and a relationship that imbues a certain shine. The trend in modern management is towards those disciples of Guardiola. Mikel Arteta has emerged as his biggest challenger in the Premier League, Xabi Alonso has just triumphed in the Bundesliga. Enzo Maresca has followed Kompany in winning the Championship. The connection with Guardiola, widely regarded as the outstanding coach of his generation, is particularly significant at Bayern. Some frame his work there as unfinished without a Champions League win but he wowed with his ideas. There is a legacy there. For Kompany, other intangibles include his own playing spell at Hamburg - he is a fluent German speaker - and his reputation for being articulate, intelligent and measured. But the top line in all this can hardly be avoided. There is the matter of that relegation. Get Sky Sports Stream big moments with NOW Football features Transfer Centre LIVE! Kompany came into the Premier League wedded to the approach that had helped garner 101 points in the Championship, winning Burnley praise for their enterprising play. They boasted the best attack and the best defence as they stormed to the title. The swiftness with which he transformed the style, after a decade of doing things so differently under Dyche, caught the eye. It was a testament to his ability to manage change that their possession stats were the highest since Championship records began. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player But despite significant investment in the summer, his team were unable to adapt to the Premier League. The passing game that had been too good for the Championship was undone by the speed and skill of those sides at the higher level, soon undermining confidence. The inequality within the Premier League was viewed by some as a mitigating circumstance. But, in the aftermath of a 3-0 defeat at Crystal Palace that would be followed up with a 2-0 home reverse to Bournemouth, Roy Keane had less sympathy for Kompany's side. \"Do you know what, they have been dreadful. They have been dreadful,\" Keane told Sky Sports. \"We talk about teams having a style of play in the Championship and trying to compare it to the Premiership, it is chalk and cheese. It is impossible. \"They look weak physically. The goals they are giving away, it is schoolboy stuff. I admire managers who have a philosophy and a style of play, but you have got to adapt. You have got to give yourself a chance of winning football matches.\" Only two teams in the Premier League made more errors leading to shots than Burnley and the contrast with the risk-free football of the Dyche era became a stick with which to beat him. Thousands more passes brought little reward, only encouraging more mistakes. It is worth noting that even in his first managerial role at Anderlecht, Kompany's methods had been questioned. The attempt to mimic Guardiola had been a concern for some in Belgium, one expressed in strong terms by the former Anderlecht manager Aad de Mos. \"In football, you do not have to copy another coach,\" said De Mos. \"Kompany wants to do the same thing as Guardiola at City and that makes me sick. City have players like Sergio Aguero and Kevin De Bruyne. Anderlecht needs to get by with more modest players.\" Bayern bosses might feasibly agree with that assessment while coming to the opposite conclusion. Perhaps they take the view that they do possess the quality of player capable of delivering this football - they just need someone who is willing and able to coach it. With one of the weakest squads in the Premier League, Kompany floundered. But with one of the best squads in the Championship, he flourished. Bayern's status within the Bundesliga, relative to the rest, is much more akin to the latter than the former. If Kompany struggles then Bayern will be criticised. If he thrives their imagination will be lauded. Whatever happens, Kompany has been vindicated in sticking to his principles. It raises intriguing questions about how coaches should approach their work. Dyche is an obvious contrast but for him it feels more like ideology than compromise. Other examples are more pertinent. Julen Lopetegui and Thomas Frank are two that come to mind - coaches who opted to adapt but now find that could be a mark against them. Lopetegui's appointment at West Ham was met with a lukewarm response. In part, that was because his rescue job with Wolves - lifting them from rock bottom to 13th in the table - was not achieved with the necessary swagger to excite, even if it did save them. Frank played a progressive game to help Brentford win promotion but, unlike Kompany, successfully switched to a more direct style to keep them there. Now, he finds some questioning whether those long throws make him suitable for a role at an elite club. For Kompany, the stain of relegation is more easily erased than a stain on his style. This move shows that coaches, like players, can be upwardly mobile regardless of results. And that a man questioned at Burnley can somehow be seen as the answer for Bayern. Correctly predict six scorelines for a chance to win £250,000 for free. Entries by 3pm Saturday.",

        "description": "INDIANAPOLIS — Rain was not Kyle Larson's friend Sunday.",
        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS — Rain was not Kyle Larson's friend Sunday. Larson was determined to complete the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600, but didn't get a chance to run a single lap in the NASCAR race. Storms swept through Indianapolis Motor Speedway and delayed the start of the race, ruining Larson's chance at finishing all 1,100 miles in a single day. But after driving his No. 17 car to an 18thplace finish in his debut in \"The Greatest Spectacle in Racing\" — despite a pair of rookie mistakes — the NASCAR star nevertheless headed to Charlotte. After two helicopter rides and about an hour-long flight, Larson arrived for the 400-lap race that Justin Allgaier had started in his place. Just as he arrived, weather brought the race to a halt with 151 laps left, giving Larson time to climb into the No. 5 car. But he never got to turn a lap at Charlotte as the race was called after a two-hour rain delay, with Christopher Bell getting the victory. \"I would definitely love to be back next year,\" Larson said about the Indy 500. \"Feel like I learned a lot. Made a couple of mistakes early there with the restart — not sure what I did there. Feel like I did a really good job after that and was able to learn a lot.\" Larson started fifth and spent most of the Indy 500 — won for the second time in a row by Josef Newgarden — hanging with the leaders. But he made a minor mistake going through the gears on an early restart and lost about 10 spots, then made a major one later in the race, when Larson locked up the tires entering pit road and was caught speeding. Larson was sixth at the time but had to drive through pit road again to serve the penalty, shuffling him outside the top 20. He managed to pick up a couple of spots over the last 70 laps but never got a caution that could have given him a chance. \"It killed our opportunity,\" Larson said of the pit-road mistake. \"Could have executed better.\" Arrow McLaren fielded the car for Larson in a partnership with Hendrick Motorsports. With rain in the forecast all week, the big question entering Sunday was whether NASCAR team owner Rick Hendrick would pull the plug on the effort and send Larson to Charlotte early so that he could race for stage points and help his chances in the Cup Series playoffs. But when the rain ended, a spokesman for Hendrick Motorsports confirmed that the Indy 500 would be the priority. \"I think it would be fantastic to have him back,\" said Larson's teammate, Pato O'Ward, who finished second after Newgarden made a last-lap pass for the win. \"I think he did a phenomenal job. I didn't see quite where he finished, but when I was playing around with him out there, playing in traffic, I think he did a phenomenal job.\" Hendrick was on hand in Indianapolis to watch the race, along with Jeff Gordon, the vice chairman of Hendrick Motorsports who largely grew up in Indiana and once dreamed of running the Indy 500. They were joined by hundreds of other fans who gathered around the No. 17 car when it was pushed to the grid about an hour before the drop of the green flag. The storm that swept through Sunday wasn't the first to disrupt Larson's plans. He had several days of practice washed out — partially or entirely — earlier in the month, limiting the amount of time he was able to spend in the car. Larson's attempt at \"The Double\" captivated those within the racing world. Most of his Hendrick Motorsports team flew to Indianapolis on Friday to watch the final practice on Carb Day, and drivers back in Charlotte were watching the start of the rain-delayed Indy 500 before heading to their own cars and getting ready for the start of the Cup Series race. \"I'm excited from the NASCAR side, but I'm more excited from the sprint car side, to see another sprint car guy go to the Indianapolis 500,\" NASCAR driver Chase Briscoe said. \"It's kind of the origins of Indy. You had these sprint car guys who would go and run — you had A.J. Foyt, Parnelli Jones, Jack Hewitt, Bryan Clauson recently — and that was always the thing. If you were the best sprint car guy, you wanted to run the Indy 500. That was the dream. So it's cool from that standpoint.\" Get local news delivered to your inbox!",

        "content": "Big Spring's softball team held its end-of-season banquet Wednesday night on the eve of the Bulldogs' District 3 Class 4A quarterfinal against top-seeded Hamburg. The players had about 45 minutes between the end of their practice and the start of the banquet. Many of them took a detour. \"Practice is over,\" head coach Mike Gutshall said. \"And there are six of them up in the cage, hitting. They don't care about getting dressed up for the banquet. I mean, we all went, but that's just the dedication they've shown, and it has come together.\" The product of that dedication has been a pair of wins on the road for the ninth-seeded Bulldogs (15-7), who went on to blank Hamburg 4-0 after opening the district tournament with an 8-2 win at Berks Catholic. Next up is another bus ride to Kennard-Dale and a semifinal showdown with the Rams scheduled for 4:30 p.m. Tuesday. It's the Big Spring program's fourth appearance in the district semifinals, one that – on the outside – might have looked even farther out of reach than the miles on the bus rides the Bulldogs have logged to get there. Halfway through the season, the Bulldogs sat with a 6-4 record. They had lost the four games by a total of six runs. A fifth loss – a 4-2 setback to Waynesboro April 23 – effectively knocked them out of title contention in the MidPenn Colonial Division, and back-to-back defeats against Greencastle-Antrim added to their slide in the District 3 power rankings. The Bulldogs had slid into ninth place with two regular-season games remaining. Only 10 teams in Class 4A advance to the tournament. \"We had a down period about three weeks ago,\" Gutshall said. \"We lost to West Perry. We lost to Waynesboro. They could've folded up then. We had a good talk, and they had a talk among themselves, and since then, they've worked hard at practice and got better every day, and this is the result. Here we are.\" THE REVENGE TOUR The Bulldogs cited a rigorous regular-season schedule as a source of their belief. Their Colonial Division gantlet included two games each against Class 5A competition in Greencastle, last year's Mid-Penn Conference champion, and Northern, which won district and state titles last spring. Big Spring's eightteam tournament during the regular season featured the likes of division rival Shippensburg (a District 3 Class 5A semifinalist), Northern Lebanon (a Class 4A semifinalist), Central York (Class 6A quarterfinalist), Chambersburg (Class 6A semifinalist) and State College (District 6 Class 6A champion). \"I told them out there that the schedule we play gets us ready for games like this,\" Gutshall said after the Bulldogs' quarterfinal win. The Bulldogs also have payback on their minds in the first two rounds of the district tournament. Berks Catholic eliminated them in last year's quarterfinals and Hamburg defeated them in 2022 for the district title in Big Spring's only championship-game appearance. The Hawks' commemorative sign hung on the fence in center field during Thursday's quarterfinal. \"I was ready to get revenge,\" senior pitcher Maeve Hurley said. \"We've been calling it the revenge tour.\" Big Spring and Kennard-Dale have only met once in the postseason, a 4-0 win for the Rams in 2007. While the revenge factor might have cooled, the Bulldogs can feel the momentum while they sit one win away from their second district final in three years. One more district win also punches their ticket to the state tournament. \"We played Greencastle twice and lost both times, which kind of gave us all anxiety,\" Hurley said. \"It gave me anxiety. I thought my season was over. But these girls really shocked me this year. I'm really proud of them.\" A POSTSEASON FORMULA The Bulldogs have checked three key boxes – pitching, defense and timely hitting – required for postseason softball success. In Thursday's quarterfinal win, Hurley had a breakthrough in the pitching circle. The senior southpaw had hit a fourth-inning wall in all of her previous starts. Against Hamburg, she allowed three hits in a complete-game shutout. She struck out five, walked one and hit one. After grinding through three three-ball counts in the first three innings, Hurley threw ball three once in the final four. \"When she falls behind (in the count), that's when she gets in trouble,\" Gutshall said. \"It's really not which pitch. When she throws strikes and gets ahead, she can do this. I've been telling her that all season.\" Big Spring's defense has also brought its support to the postseason, particularly on the left side of the field, where Victoria Rinaldii at shortstop, Aubree Frehn at third base and Izzy Fry in left field accounted for 12 of the 16 outs that weren't strikeouts. \"From the time we got off the bus, our defense played well,\" Gutshall said. \"Through our warm-up, and then through the game, I mean, wow. In my 12 years, this is our best defense, even statistically. We have caught the ball this year.\" The Bulldogs averaged 14 runs per game in their 13 regular-season wins, relying on big swings and crooked numbers. Their lowest run total in a win before Thursday was seven. But 10 timely singles and a set of strategic bunts helped the offense scratch across enough runs for the win. The extra time in the cage before the banquet paid off. \"This wasn't us during the season,\" Gutshall said. \"We had 10 singles. We manufactured runs today where normally, we're hitting two or three home runs.\" The pitching, defense and timely hits have all fed another key factor in postseason success: confidence. \"It's all confidence,\" Gutshall said. \"It is. The high school season is a long season, and right now, these girls, to be playing at the level they're playing right now, they're confident. They're ready to play.\" Tim Gross is the sports editor at The sentinel and cumberlink.com . email him at tgross@cumberlink.com and follow him on Twitter at: @ByTimGross 1 Get local news delivered to your inbox!",

        "content": "PIAA TRACK AND FIELD SHIPPENSBURG — Carlisle's relay teams had already broken the school's 4x100and 4x400-meter records at the PIAA Track and Field Championships when Thundering Herd senior Darian Crim stepped to the starting line – four times thanks to restarts and anxious leadoff runners – for Saturday's Class 3A 4x800-meter final. The field finally got a clean start, and Crim, followed by Kolbin Heberlig, Josh Blanton and James Millare, took their turn at securing a piece of school history. The Carlisle quartet finished second in the Class 3A 4x800 in a school-record time of seven minutes, 44.11 seconds. It was the top finish among Sentinel-area boys on the final day of the state meet. Carlisle also finished seventh in a Class 3A 4x100-meter relay final that saw Cumberland Valley's team match a school record in a third-place performance. West Perry's Marcus Quaker won the only local individual medal of the day, taking third place in the Class 3A 300-meter hurdles final. Herd history The stops and restarts at the beginning of the 4x800 final drew a few groans from the crowd as the tension increased at the starting line. Crim kept his cool. \"Them making us restart almost gave me more confidence,\" he said. \"Everybody kept jumping off the line, and I just stood there. I was composed.\" When the sound of the electronic starting gun beeped across the stadium, uninterrupted, Cim shot to the front of the pack and held on for first place at the first exchange. For the next six laps, Heberlig, Blanton and Millare took turns jockeying with runners from Council Rock North, the eventual champion (7:38.73), and Souderton (7:44.67), whose anchor pushed Millare all the way to the finish line. \"Once I got past him, I didn't expect him to catch me,\" said Millare, who posted a split time of 1:52.60. \"I didn't even notice if he was close or not. I was just focused on catching the next guy if I could.\" Millare later finished 30th in the Class 3A open 800-meter championship finals (2:03.00). He and Blanton, sons of Army War College students, expect to continue their high school careers elsewhere after the season. Crim is set to graduate. They plan to compete together in the distance medley relay at nationals June 1316. They're satisfied with their final performance in the 800, which took down the previous Carlisle record of 7:44.20 in 2009. \"I'm glad we got to pull it together in our last relay together as a team,\" Blanton said. Eagles take flight Cumberland Valley's 4x100-meter relay team clocked in under 43 seconds for the first time in an April 30 dual meet with State College. Since then, Rukie Efeturi, Seth Beardsley, Owen Bramblett and Ke'Aune Green have taken flight individually and as a team. It all culminated with Saturday's record-matching bronze medal run in the Class 3A finals. The Eagles surged into third place at 42.00 seconds, matching the school record set in 2001. \"Once we broke 43, almost every race we had was a PR,\" Beardsley said. \"We've been practicing our handoffs and getting precise. Our coach does a good job of making our steps perfect.\" Coatesville clocked in at 41.45 for the title. Souderton won silver at 41.66. Green, who broke the school's individual 100-meter dash record by running a 10.71 in Friday's preliminary heats, picked off runners as he surged through the home stretch. Bramblett, who handed him the baton, turned to see the times pop up on the Seth Grove Stadium scoreboard and clapped his hands when he saw the result. \"I just had a lot of fun,\" Green said. \"This morning, it was a really nice vibe because everybody was excited to come here and perform.\" Efeturi, Bramblett and Green hope to continue the momentum next season despite losing Beardsley, the relay team's lone senior, to graduation. \"Obviously, we're going to miss Seth,\" said Efeturi, a MidPenn 100-meter dash finalist this spring. \"He's very fast, and he's a great second leg, but this race gives us hope that we can become even better in the future.\" Carlisle's Crim, Parker Smith, Paulie Pretopapa and Javani Mosley broke Carlisle's 4x100-meter relay in their preliminary heat Friday. They broke the previous record (42.49) again in Saturday's final to take seventh place at 42.40. Quaker the quick Quaker has sported a soft cast on his left hand throughout the postseason, waiting to find out whether he'll need surgery on his thumb. It was the latest injury in a series of setbacks that had hindered the West Perry senior throughout the spring season. He pushed through regardless. Citing his Christian faith and his commitment to working through the adversity, Quaker finished third in the Class 3A 300-meter hurdles Saturday after missing the final and placing 12th overall last spring. \"To be top three in the state is a blessing,\" he said. Tyler Burgess, who won the 110-meter hurdles final earlier, completed the double-gold performance at 37.47. Parkland's Andrew Beers pulled into second place at 38.17. Quaker, who plans to play football and study business management at Mansfield in the fall, knew he had to make up ground in the race from his spot in Lane 2. \"I noticed Lane 1 was passing me,\" he said, \"and Lane 3 was passing me, so I had to start going. Once I hit the 100-meter mark, I saw Burgess and Beers in front of me, and I just took off.\" Field notes Quaker and Pretopapa also competed in Friday's Class 3A javelin throw, finishing 11th (1732) and 18th (156-1). In the afternoon's Class 3A discus throw, Shippensburg's Derek Lynch took 11th place (150-5) while East Pennsboro's Josh Angelo and Logan Newman finished 15th (146-3) and 16th (145-8). Trinity's Jeremiah Hargrove took ninth place in the Class 2A triple jump (43-5.75). Camp Hill's Liam Murphy cleared the opening height of 12-0 to finish 17th in the Class 2A pole vault. Coatesville claimed the Class 3A team title with 27 total points, one more than Palmyra and Butler, which had 26 each. Slippery Rock Area earned the Class 2A crown with 41 points.

        "description": "Whether Puerto Rico should be granted statehood is a hot topic in Washington. That's because, if the island became America's 51st state, it would likely result in two more Democratic senators and a handful of new Democratic representatives.",
        "content": "Whether Puerto Rico should be granted statehood is a hot topic in Washington. That's because, if the island became America's 51st state, it would likely result in two more Democratic senators and a handful of new Democratic representatives. In 1898, after the Spanish-American War, Puerto Rico was officially designated as an \"unincorporated territory.\" This matters because unincorporated territories, unlike incorporated territories, are not considered potential states. Alaska and Hawaii, on the other hand, were granted the status of incorporated territories in 1912 and 1898, respectively. As such, both were granted statehood in 1959. More important, it would be unwise to make Puerto Rico the 51st state because the island is an economic basket case. Puerto Rico is drowning in tens of billions of dollars of debt. If Puerto Rico were to become a state, that financial burden would be absorbed by the U.S. government and added to the $34.5 trillion national debt. The United States spends close to $1 trillion a year on interest payments on the national debt. We cannot afford any more debt. Unfortunately, the average per-capita income in Puerto Rico is $24,560, according to Statista. This is significantly lower than the per-capita income in the United States ($65,423) and well below the per-capita income of Mississippi ($48,110), which ranks as the poorest state in the nation. So if Puerto Rico were granted statehood, many of the 3.2 million people living on the island would become eligible for federal benefits such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. This would add a huge new load to programs that are already overburdened and skyrocketing in cost. Many social and political problems also are associated with Puerto Rican statehood. For instance, many Puerto Ricans don't speak English, and many identify more with their Puerto Rican heritage. Some Puerto Ricans prefer independence to U.S. statehood. Moreover, if Puerto Rico were to become a state, it would incentivize other territories and the District of Columbia to pursue statehood. This would further upset the delicate balance of political power because it would likely result in total Democratic control of Congress and the executive branch. As then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in 2019, when the issue of Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico statehood reached an apex in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives: \"They plan to make the District of Columbia a state — that'd give them two new Democratic senators — Puerto Rico a state, that would give them two more new Democratic senators. So this is full-bore socialism on the march in the House. And yeah, as long as I'm the majority leader of the Senate, none of that stuff is going anywhere.\" McConnell is right. If Puerto Rico became a state, it would likely result in decades of Democratic political control. We also must recognize that granting statehood is an arduous process that necessitates several steps, including a referendum among the people, passage by both houses of Congress and the signature of the president. Given that Puerto Rico is not an incorporated territory, that the people of Puerto Rico seem mostly apathetic on statehood, that Congress is unlikely to agree and that presidential authorization isn't guaranteed, Puerto Rican statehood is a pipe dream. Talgo is the editorial director at The Heartland Institute. He wrote this for InsideSources.com .

        "description": "Compared to other areas in town, Leicester Road was quite late in being developed with West End Villas, a pair of three-storey semi-detached villas, opposite Aldi car park being the first houses to be built around 1880.",
        "content": "The builder, Robert Weaver, lived in one of them with his wife Dorothy, and the other was occupied by Rev Joseph Twidale and his wife Catharine, of the Baptist Church, now the United Reformed Church. The lake behind the villas, and what is now a vehicle storage yard, is known as Weaver’s Lake and was most probably dug to provide earth for the railway embankment running across the bottom of the grounds.

A few years later, in the late 1880s, a new property known as Seedsfield House was erected on Leicester Road and this was built for Joseph Dickinson, a pork pie and cheese producer. Only a few years earlier, Joseph had submitted a claim for injury to his seeds field. The claim was made up of two items: the award of his valuer, £2 10s and 15s for man’s time rolling and seeding down the portion damaged. Maybe the house was built on that very field, hence the name. No more houses were built on Leicester Road until the 1930s when the Melton Urban District Council built the Lake Terrace estate. Around the same time, the owners of Seedsfield House had decided to build a smaller more modern property on vacant land next door and in the late 1930s, a new Seedsfield House was built. Advertisement Advertisement Consequently, the old Seedsfield House was put up for sale and purchased by the St Mary’s Church for use as a vicarage. The first vicar to take up residence was the Rev Canon Harold Bates and his wife, who moved from the original vicarage (Blakeney Institute) opposite St Mary’s Church. Harold Bates was the vicar at St Mary’s from 1937 until he died in 1945. He was a veteran of WW1 and helped the Reverend Tubby Clayton set up Talbot House, Toc-H in Poperinge Belgium. During WW2, Harold could quite often be seen at night patrolling around his beloved St Mary’s. In 1962, the Church purchased a new property at 67 Dalby Road for use as a new vicarage, resulting in Seedsfield House being sold off and becoming known as The Old Vicarage.",

        "content": "For 107 years, Puerto Ricans have lived as second-class U.S. citizens. Just last month, the U.S.Commission for Civil Rights' Puerto Rico Advisory Committee released a memorandum highlighting the subjugation of Puerto Rico and revealing continuing disparities faced by its 3.2 million U.S. citizens. The memo exposed a sad yet undeniable reality: Puerto Ricans have been subjected to structural and racial discrimination at the hands of Congress and the Supreme Court due to territorial status. This includes Puerto Ricans' diminished federal voting rights, Medicare, Social Security and veterans' benefits. Congress can solve this territorial oppression by supporting the Senate and House versions of the Puerto Rico Status Act. The U.S.Commission on Civil Rights' Puerto Rico Advisory Committee was established in 2022 to investigate civil rights issues affecting residents of Puerto Rico. Its memorandum included testimony and insights from the island, including constitutional law scholars, veterans, civil society leaders and citizens. The document shines light on the systemic political discrimination faced by Puerto Ricans, which includes having no vote for president, no representation in the Senate nor a voting member of the House of Representatives — despite having a population greater than 19 states. The memorandum also exposes how the Supreme Court has legislated from the bench by denying Puerto Rico's path to statehood and justifying Congress' discrimination under federal laws and programs. Underneath this dark web of century-old federal case law, Puerto Rico residents are seen as \"alien races\" unable to understand Anglo-Saxon forms of government. The committee plans to investigate these disparities and present recommendations to end inequality and civil rights violations stemming from Puerto Rico's territory status. My recommendation is simple: Congress must pass the Puerto Rico Status Act to give the 3.2 million U.S. citizens a binding vote to choose their political future outside of the colonial territory status. The situation in Puerto Rico is dire, with more than 700,000 people leaving due to inequality and lack of opportunities, tearing apart families and communities. If any state experienced a 12% drop in population due to legal subjugation, it would be a national scandal. One cause of this outmigration is Puerto Rico's unequal treatment under Medicare. Local health care professionals receive reimbursement rates 43% below the national average, according to the memorandum. This has led thousands of doctors, nurses and other health care professionals to move stateside, leaving elderly residents of Puerto Rico and those with disabilities even more vulnerable. Meanwhile, retired Brig. Gen. Victor Pérez outlined how dignity is being denied to the U.S. citizens on the island. His testimony notes how pride in America has driven more than 250,000 Puerto Ricans to serve in the U.S. military, historically on a higher per-capita basis than many states. But the common sentiment among Puerto Rican veterans is often disillusionment after bravely serving America, only to return home and find themselves denied basic rights and equal treatment. As Puerto Rico works to recover from devastating natural disasters and fiscal and political crises, all Americans must notice the pressing need to address the civil rights violations. Voters in Puerto Rico have spoken at the polls, demanding change and an end to the territory status three times in the past decade. Congress should listen to voters on the island by passing the Puerto Rico Status Act, which would allow America to reconcile its colonial history with Puerto Rico. All Americans who believe in the fundamental promises of American democracy should support this legislation. The civil rights of your fellow U.S. citizens depend on it, and so does the future of American democracy.

        "content": "HARRISBURG — Pennsylvania lawmakers want Gov. Josh Shapiro's Department of Aging to disclose more about the shortcomings it finds when it evaluates whether county-level agencies are properly investigating complaints about the abuse or neglect of older adults. The effort comes as Republican state lawmakers have pressed Shapiro's administration to do more to investigate the deaths of older adults who are the subject of an abuse or neglect complaint after Pennsylvania recorded a steep increase in such deaths. Rep. Louis Schmitt, R-Blair, introduced legislation Wednesday requiring the department to publish the compliance status of each of the 52 county-level agencies that it's supposed to inspect annually, and to publish a report on the findings. \"The public needs to know. The public deserves to know. The public has a right to know,\" Schmitt said in an interview. \"You cannot hide if you're going to conduct public business, especially public business that affects the health and safety and welfare of seniors in Pennsylvania.\" The department told lawmakers earlier this year that it had deemed seven of the agencies to be noncompliant. The year before that, 13 were noncompliant when lawmakers asked. In a statement Thursday, the Department of Aging said it looked forward to working with Schmitt. The department said it expects to introduce a new performance evaluation process beginning in June and will post results on its website. The department has recently declined requests by the Associated Press for two sets of documents: one in which the department outlines to county-level agencies the shortcomings it found and another in which the county-level agency must explain how it will fix those shortcomings. The department, under Shapiro's predecessor, former Gov. Tom Wolf, had provided such documents unredacted to the AP. Those refusals come after a January evaluation of Philadelphia's agency found that its protective services bureau had improperly handled 16 — or one-third — of 50 closed cases that were picked at random for the review. The details of complaints, investigations and the identity of the person whose situation is in question are kept secret. The Philadelphia Corporation For Aging declined to comment. A letter the department sent to the agency didn't describe the problems or how the agency planned to fix them. Asked about the fate of the 16 adults, the department said none of their cases \"required a referral to law enforcement or a report to the coroner's office.\" The department also said it is taking steps to help the Philadelphia agency, including by encouraging the agency to seek out a broader pool of applicants for caseworkers and supervisory staff and expanding training. The department has contracts with 52 county-level \"area agencies for aging\" — nicknamed triple As — across Pennsylvania to field and investigate abuse and neglect complaints and, ultimately, ensure the older adult is safe and connected to the appropriate social services. Some are county-run and some are privately run. Sheri McQuown, a protective services specialist who left the Department of Aging last year after almost seven years, said there is no reason the department cannot publish the findings from its evaluations and the local agencies' corrective action plans. \"The public should know what they're paying for, what they're getting for their money, and older adults should know which triple As are effective and which are not,\" McQuown said. How the Philadelphia agency handles complaints has stoked repeated concerns. At one point, the state stepped in to handle investigations. McQuown questioned whether the Department of Aging has the spine to hold the county-level agencies accountable. High numbers of deficiencies has long been the norm for Philadelphia and some other agencies, she said. The county-level agencies do not always comply with state requirements that limit caseworkers' caseloads, set deadlines to resolve cases and set timelines within which caseworkers must promptly see potential victims. The agencies also decide which complaints to investigate, and state data has long shown disparities between the agencies in how often they deemed a complaint to be worthy of action.

        "content": "PHILADELPHIA — A Commonwealth Court decision striking down a directive that allowed students with disabilities to remain in school until age 22 — and a subsequent appeal — has left potentially hundreds of families in limbo, as districts are making independent decisions on whether to cut or keep services. In the wake of last Thursday's ruling, numerous districts have informed parents whose children are turning 22 in the coming academic year that they will no longer be able to attend school — an abrupt termination for families who had anticipated remaining enrolled until as late as next spring. \"We feel like the rug was just pulled out from underneath us,\" said Carolyn Kelly, whose 21-year-old daughter attends the Council Rock School District and was informed on Monday that her services would soon be ending. Meanwhile, some districts say they will continue to provide services until students turn 22. They cited the Pennsylvania Department of Education's appeal, which officials said stayed the ruling. What led to the latest decision? Before last year, Pennsylvania had only guaranteed services for students with disabilities through the school year in which they turn 21. But advocates for students with disabilities said federal law already requires services through a student's 22nd birthday — citing language from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, that refers to students \"between the ages of 3 and 21, inclusive.\" Courts have forced some other states, including Connecticut and Rhode Island, to provide services until students turn 22. In July, lawyers sued Pennsylvania on behalf of a Lower Merion student, arguing that the state was illegally depriving a vulnerable population of needed services. As part of a settlement agreement, the education department announced the next month that it had revised its policy, and that any students who had turned 21 and exited in the previous school year could reenroll in their district. The Pennsylvania School Boards Association and three districts — including Central Bucks and Upper Darby — then sued to block the change. The districts argued the education department didn't have the authority to unilaterally make the decision, and also said they hadn't been given time to budget for the reenrolled students. \"Our members were neither consulted about nor prepared to implement such a change,\" said a spokesperson for the association, Mackenzie Christiana. What did the decision say? On Thursday, the Commonwealth Court sided with the districts, finding that the education department's directive was void and \"unenforceable.\" The department needed to follow a formal rule-making process in order to institute the change, the court said, rejecting the department's contention that it had only issued \"guidance\" rather than a new regulation. The court, however, said it did not consider \"whether the New Age-Out Plan is necessary for the Department to comply with the IDEA, just that the Department must promulgate the change in accordance with\" state rule-making laws. A spokesperson for the education department said it appealed the ruling Monday. \"The Shapiro administration is committed to ensuring that every Pennsylvania student receives a high-quality education — and PDE believes that its guidance, which helps to ensure students with disabilities receive the services to which they are entitled, is consistent with federal law,\" Casey Smith said. Smith said the appeal meant the court's decision was \"stayed pending resolution of the appeal or further order of court.\" How are school districts responding? While Smith said the department had notified districts that it believes its guidance last year \"is consistent with IDEA\" — meaning, students would be entitled to receive services until 22 — districts have been taking different approaches since the ruling. As of Tuesday, the Public Interest Law Center — which was involved in filing the case against the state last July — said it had heard from parents in 10 districts that services were being cut off for their children next year. \"They're telling parents the court has invalidated\" the directive, and \"we're required to graduate you,\" said Claudia De Palma, a staff attorney at the law center. But \"our position is that federal law\" requires services provided through age 22. At least one district reversed course. Central Bucks on Tuesday informed families of 23 students that in light of the education department's appeal, \"we will honor their current IEP and continue to provide service to age 22,\" acting Superintendent Jim Scanlon said. Upper Darby — another district that had challenged the education department's policy — said Wednesday it was still reviewing the court's decision and department's appeal, \"and we will comment when it is best for all involved,\" spokesperson Aaronda Beauford said. What does it mean for families? Two parents told the Inquirer they had been notified by their districts that their children's services would be ending in light of the court ruling. \"It was really just a two-sentence email,\" said one parent, whose 21-year-old child attends the Norristown Area School District. The parent, who asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation, said the district told her the court had \"overruled\" the age-22 policy, and her child's services would now end next month — rather than when he turns 22, nearly a year from now. Now she's scrambling to get her child work through the state Office of Vocational Rehabilitation, which she first signed up for in 2022. \"The queue is very, very long,\" she said, though she was able to get a meeting with a case manager scheduled for June. She's worried about what will happen if her son can't obtain services in time. \"It means my child would sit home and watch TV, 24 hours a day every day,\" she said. She and her husband have been discussing who might quit their job to help care for him. Jillian Williamson, a spokesperson for the Norristown district, said the district \"must follow the law and abide by all legal rulings regarding student enrollment.\" She said the district \"will support our students and families to the greatest extent possible while remaining in compliance with our legal requirements as a public school district as this matter continues to be litigated.\" Kelly, the Council Rock parent, didn't know there was litigation over the age-out policy until Monday, when she heard from the district \"out of the blue\" that her daughter's services would be ending. Her daughter won't turn 22 until next May, and \"we don't have anything with respect to a job lined up for her,\" Kelly said. \"Any transportation, any speech therapy or occupational therapy she was getting at school — all of that stuff just goes away in June, for her, with less than a month's notice to us.\" She's started the process of trying to get her daughter a waiver from the state for adult services, but there are waiting lists. Most providers \"don't have vacancies,\" said Josh Fields, executive director of the Next Step Programs in Bucks County, who said he got calls from \"afraid and frustrated\" families after the ruling. \"We don't really know how this is going to play out,\" said Fields, who has been encouraging parents to work with county offices and case managers.

        "content": "Entrepreneur and former chairman of CBI Wales, Michael Plaut, has been appointed to the board of the BBC. Cardiff-born Mr Plaut, whose other roles include chairing the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama - part of the University of South Wales where is he also a board member - joins the board of the public service broadcaster as nations director for Wales. He will take up his new role on June 1 on a four-year term. The nations director role for Wales was previously held by Elan Closs Stephens. His appointment was confirmed by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Mr Plaut, who began his career in investment banking in London, has international export experience through running family-owned business Northmace. Chair of the BBC board, Samir Shah, said: “I’m thrilled to welcome Michael Plaut to the board. “His experience across business, governance and the arts in Wales will make him a valuable addition, and I look forward to working with him.” BBC board members receive a base payment of £33,000 a year. For chairing a committee there is an additional payment of £5,000. The board is responsible for ensuring the BBC fulfils its mission and public purposes as set out in the Charter. Its oversight includes setting the strategic direction of the broadcaster, its budget and ensuring value for money and a strategy and governance arrangements for its commercial activities. The BBC board consists of 14 members, including the chair. Four non-executive members are appointed by the UK Government to represent each of the nations of the UK. As well as Mr Plaut for Wales, they are for Scotland, Muriel Grey, Robbie Gibb for England and Michael Smyth for Northern Ireland. Mr Plaut, who lives in Cardiff, was awarded an OBE for services to business and entrepreneurship in 2019.",

        "content": "For a few years now I’ve been teaching a class on erotic writing. Most of it follows the same structure of any creative-writing class—we discuss character and motivation—but the content, you can imagine, takes on a different slant. It’s both a fun and hard class to teach; hard because the students are immediately thrown into vulnerability, immediately figuring out how much of themselves they’re willing lay bare before strangers, and fun in realizing that everyone else in the class is embarrassed in exactly the same way, and that everyone is always, always, a little bit of a freak. A few interesting observations: good sex in the bedroom does not automatically make for good sex on paper; there’s no position that’s sexy enough to work without us knowing why the characters want to fuck; and even when you’ve figured out the why, having only an external motivation (“he’s HOT”) or only an external hurdle (“our PARENTS won’t LET US”) is not enough. The text needs to work to get us to the same level as the characters themselves, to feel their desire as our own. A good sex scene has you teetering between experience and voyeurship: you’re seeing what’s happening, and you’re feeling it yourself. This is why sex translated from real life tends to fall flat on the page: writers stick to the order of events, movements, and forget the reader isn’t entering the text with the lust they felt in the moment. It all comes down to creating tension through stakes. A reverse cowgirl, unfortunately, is not stakes enough. Most literary text, whether erotic or not, will try to create some kind of tension with the reader. First of all through language, through small exercises in metaphors. The IKEA effect on the page: language as a puzzle for us to solve—wait, how may bolts are in the package? Where does the short rod go?—and in having the meet the text halfway we have come to feel invested in the result. Look, I put this one together! I figured it out! Consider Raven Leilani’s sexy and confusing 2020 novel, where contrasting language pushes the narrator’s desires forward: She is, I suppose, sexy in the way a triangle can be sexy, the clean pivot from point A to B to C, her body and face breaking no rules, following each other in a way that is logical and curt. Of course, in motion, when she turns and stoops to open the oven, the geometry is weirder. The work we have to do to comprehend what Luster means with the sexiness of a triangle feels like flirting, like half game half tension; the inherent contrast between the word “sexy” and “triangle” creates that same tension within the text. We can apply the same logic on a broader level, to scenes and movement on the page. Take, for example, Elaine Castillo’s scorching hot : Hero had been told before, not always in a complimentary way, that she was loud when she came—near-silent panting all the way through, and then deafening, devouring cries when it happened. Since arriving in California she’d toned it down, couldn’t let herself go, thought she’d changed....But when she finally came, slick-lipped, lifting her hips to grind her clit shamelessly against Rosalyn’s finger...she felt Rosalyn physically startle at the volume of her cry, fingerhold briefly slipping, before she rallied and rubbed Hero through it. When Hero’s cries petered out to a whine, Rosalyn slowed down to a bare flutter, just for a few seconds, only to gently wind Hero back up again, circling, no mercy, so it didn’t take long for Hero to give it up a second time, growling, annoyed—at how good it was, at how much she’d missed it, at how much more she wanted. Shit. We have the tension in the language itself, negative contrast walking us through the first three sentences (“near-silent” vs “deafening, devouring cries” vs “couldn’t let herself go”) followed by an outpour once Hero comes; the text mimics the climax, goes into staccato rhythm, and we end on a single sentence with ten commas, followed by a single word: The movements of the character are in tension: what she expects to happen once she comes (silence), and what does happen (a cry). We as readers are swung back and forth between witnessing the pleasure and wondering at its impact: words like “give up” and “annoyed” and “want,” the knife’s edge between desire and reluctance. How pleasure in our own bodies can sometimes feel invasive. The game that is writing a good sex is one of knowing when to pull the tension tight and when to slacken it. In other words: don’t let the reader get too comfortable. It’s a play of balance between allowance (the narrator allowing our presence, the character allowing pleasure) and discomfort (our own discomfort at being voyeurs, but also the character’s potential discomfort in relation to their own desires). I have this exercise that I do with my students, where I walk them through this one poem by Ellen Bass— Figs—and then ask them to keep track of which words feel soft and welcoming, which feel uneasy for platonic reasons, and which uncomfortable because of their sudden erotics. It starts out easy: “Bring me your pain, love. Spread / it out like fine rugs, silk sashes, / warm eggs, cinnamon / and cloves in burlap sacks.” The soft words are obvious: fine rugs, silk sashes, cinnamon. No one likes the warm eggs. Everyone always makes a face at the warm eggs. And I ask why, and then the associations start rolling: why are they warm, what made them warm, the yolky slimy runny—you get the idea. We continue: “Show me / the detail, the intricate embroidery / on the collar, tiny shell buttons, the hem stitched the way you were taught, / pricking just a thread, almost invisible.” Tiny shell buttons, intricate embroidery—lovely. And then the word “pricking,” a tiny jolt in an otherwise harmless stanza. “Unclasp it like jewels, the gold / still hot from your body. Empty / your basket of figs. Spill your wine.” And we return to the heat, the warmth, and now we have a culprit: the body. No, body. The demand: empty your basket of figs (!), spill your wine. The possessive is arresting, here—what are figs? What is wine? The literal fruit, the literal drink, or something that comes from within me, something more bodily? Which brings us to the point where everyone starts shifting in their seats, where the discomfort sets in: “That hard nugget of pain, I would suck it, / cradling it on my tongue like the slick / seed of pomegranate.” Nugget of pain! Suck it! Slick seed of a pomegranate! It’s the contrast that makes it land the way it does, how we start with sweet embroidery and shell buttons, to then enter the body fully: putting things in our mouths, sucking them, weaving it around the word, “pain.” And for the final crescendo, we start out gently once more—”I would lift it, / tenderly, as a great animal might / carry a small one”—only to end with the danger of love baring its teeth, offering them as protection: “in the private / cave of the mouth.” Once, after reading the poem out loud to the class, a student took a deep breath and said, Bass’s poem is the tamest and most PG-rated text we read in my class, and it always seem to have this effect—to leave everyone blushing and quiet for a second. And that’s the magic of erotica. What makes it work isn’t the act of sex, but the tension the text manages to create, within itself and within you. It’s the stakes the text has created for the characters, for their desires; it’s the discomfort that it’s putting you through. The discomfort that you then choose to push through, or perhaps sit with. Or perhaps to simply enjoy. Take a breath, hold it. Exhale. ______________________________ .",

        "content": "Former PBA import Chris McCullough will be one of the imports of Strong Group when it competes in the 43rd William Jones Cup in Taipei, Taiwan slated July 13 to 21. This as McCullough signed up to the play for the Athletics – five years since he last played for the San Miguel Beermen. He left the country with lots of fond memories as he helped the Beermen won 2019 PBA Commissioner’s Cup. He hopes to provide SGA the same passion and fire when they play in Taipei. It can be recalled that the 6-foot-9 McCullough, 29, reportedly offered his services to Gilas Pilipinas but things did not work out well. For McCullough, who once suited up for the Brooklyn Nets, it is always a pleasure to don the country’s tricolors. “After so many years, it’s truly surreal to be returning to the country (Philippines). Even though it’s just for a short while,” said McCullough. “The experience of flying back, training, and being in the Philippines again is going to be amazing,” he added. After his SMB stint, McCullough hopped from one team to another that saw him play for Anyang KGC (South Korea), Rytas Vilnius (Lithuania), Al-Ahli (Bahrain), and Gigantes de Carolina (Puerto Rico). He last played for the Formosa Dreamers in the P.League+ where he averaged 18.8 points and 12.5 rebounds and led them into the semifinals. Thanks to Chris Ross, he was reconnected to SGA head coach Chris Tiu. “I also want to give a shoutout to Chris Ross for assisting in connecting us.”",

        "content": "PREDIKSI dan sifat hujan bulanan menunjukkan kondisi selama akan mendominasi hingga September 2024. Untuk itu, daerah dengan potensi curah hujan bulanan sangat rendah, kurang dari 50 mm/bulan, perlu mendapatkan perhatian khusus untuk mitigasi dampak kekeringan. “Daerah tersebut meliputi sebagian Lampung, pulau Jawa, Bali, NTB dan NTT serta sebagian Sulawesi Selatan dan Sulawesi tenggara,” kata Kepala Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi dan Geofisika ( ) Dwikorita Karnawati, dalam konferensi pers yang diselenggarakan secara virtual, Selasa (28/5). Sementara itu, pada September 2024, curah hujan di bawah 50 mm/bulan masih berpeluang terjadi di pulau Jawa, Bali, NTB dan NTT. Oktober 2024, yakni curah hujan di bawah 50 mm/bulan diprediksi terjadi di sebagian Jawa Timur, NTB dan NTT. “Jadi tampaknya, Jawa Timur, NTB dan NTT mengalami kondisi curah hujan sangat rendah atau kurang dari 50 mm/bulan itu dimulai pada bulan Juni. Berlangsung terus hingga Juli bahkan Agustus juga masih, September juga, dan Oktober. Jadi ini yang perlu diwaspadai,” beber Dwikorita. Ia menyatakan, berdasarkan pemantauan, kini el nino yang memengaruhi iklim di Indonesia sudah berada di level netra. Hingga dasarian kedua, 10 hari kedua di Mei 2024, pemantauan anomali iklim global di Samudera Pasifik indeks enso dalam kondisi 0,21 atau dalam kondisi netral. “Kondisi indeks enso sudah berada pada indeks netral selama dua dasarian, dan diprediksi akan terus netral sampai Juni Juli 2024,” beber dia. Lalu Juli, Agustus, September enso netral diprediksi akan beralih menuju fase la nina lemah yang akan bertahan hingga akhir tahun 2024. “Fenomena la nina lemah diprediksi tidak berdampak pada musim kemarau yang akan segera terjadi,” ucapnya.

        "content": "I have heard stories of artists and writers being enormously productive during periods of war, plague, and national crisis, but I wasn’t one of them. Just before lockdown began, I had published my first book and begun working on a second—a novel about a queer woman photographer and a nonbinary journalist who decide to do an ambitious art project together. But as hundreds of thousands of people were dying, anything that happened in the mind now seemed like a fucking joke. I thought. . On one of the many nights at home, I rewatched that great work of American cinema, (2002). It’s about four female friends surfing in Hawaii, although two of them don’t really matter. The two who do are Anne Marie—white, blond, incapable of wearing a shirt with sleeves—and Eden—Latinx, board shorts, drives a jet ski. Anne Marie is established as the more talented of the two, so Eden assumes the role of her trainer. When AM gets involved with an NFL player visiting Hawaii on vacation, jeopardizing her training by ordering pancakes post-coitus and swimming in the ocean in a cocktail dress, Eden is pissed—possibly about AM throwing away her talents, possibly something else (I am not the first to suggest that this movie is very, very gay) but ultimately Eden is there, watching from the shore, as AM makes her big bid for surfing stardom. I loved Michelle Rodriguez as Eden—she seemed hungry throughout the whole movie. She seemed starved. There was also something in the movie that reminded me of the untouched book project: a story of something more than friendship, more than romance, and more than being artistic collaborators; it was all three. I became obsessed with the character of Eden. I wanted to see her face. No, more than that, I wanted to her face, to make her face appear out of nothing, and in so making, I wanted to understand the essence of her hunger and of my own disdain for the idea of being the one who doesn’t do the making of the great thing but instead plays second fiddle. I could not have written Eden’s face. I could have painted it or drawn it, I guess, but I can’t paint or draw. I remembered that I had led feelings-forward collage workshops for teenage girls in southeastern West Virginia. I cleared my shitty wooden table and procured a small plastic scissor, a decrepit paintbrush, magazines, and crusty jar of Mod Podge—a form of glue that can go both over and beneath your creations. I began with the general shape of her face and finding chunks of magazine that were the right colors for her skin and hair. I worked from a photograph of Michelle Rodriguez—I am no great conjurer. Then I moved the bits of paper around and added darker and lighter places for a long time. For a while, no face emerged. Then suddenly, one did. Collage works in layers that are both similar to and totally unlike drafts of writing: nothing is erased; things are only added. I found it was easier in collage than in writing to move toward a hypothesis without knowing if the hypothesis would be supportable, to be attracted to color or shape simply for its aesthetic pleasure. The ghost of your process is always there in collage, physical and feel-able when you run your fingers over it. I worked toward the hypothesis of Eden’s eyes, that Eden’s watching her friend/beloved was the animating force of her face. As I worked, I understood that it can be a sacred experience to watch someone you love out there on the ocean, making something beautiful, even as you are yourself are still on the shore. On the hunt for more imbalanced artistic duos, I rewatched (2013). Frances, a fledgling dancer, and Sophie, a more established book editor, are codependent friends in Brooklyn, sharing a bed. “The story of us,” Frances calls it when Sophie tells it–they will love each other and be successful artists together forever. As Sophie becomes increasingly serious about her boyfriend, a man improbably named “Patch,” she and Frances drift apart. Frances becomes broker and makes more and more “unhinged” decisions, while Sophie becomes ever more hinged until she finally moves to Japan for Patch’s job. Frances is devastated. I liked the early stage of my Frances collage best—the one with no eyes. Unlike Eden, Frances isn’t watching Sophie, she wants to be watched Sophie, she wants to be witnessed, and comes unraveled without that witnessing. As I collaged, I worked towards a different hypothesis of why some people need to be the beloved—it was the story. Frances wasn’t capable of telling a solo story, only a story in relation, and without the story of Sophie and Frances, there was no story of Frances alone. This is, I think, a thing that really happens to people, an interesting thing that is worthy of being depicted in a book from the inside. I began to return to the tricky character in my novel to see if this might be true of her too. As I wrote, just little notes, I realized I had a new question: I began to think that my novel would feature not just an imbalance in love but an imbalance in notoriety, the beloved, who was now named Bernie, achieving more fame and success than her friend, Leah. How, I now wanted to know, does that external force act upon the intimacy of a couple? I found just such a test site in Robyn Crawford, the “longtime companion” of Whitney Houston–what a strange thing, to be, forever, an “of” of someone!—her best friend, ex-girlfriend, assistant, scheduler, fixer, caretaker. It was summer now, and I walked around Cobbs Creek Park sweating and listening to Crawford narrate her 2019 memoir, . Crawford and Houston met when they were 19 and 17 respectively and they had a romantic relationship for several years before Houston signed her first record contract and told Crawford that their relationship could no longer be sexual. After that, Crawford says, being close to Houston looked like loving and supporting Houston emotionally and logistically however was most needed. There was pleasure there, and enjoyment, and jokes and common interests—the two apparently loved dancing, basketball, and doing drugs together. What broke them seems not to have been Crawford’s resentment at being sidelined but rather Houston’s ultimate inability—heightened by her family and by homophobia—to accept Crawford’s care. I found, as I tried to conjure the immense light and glow in Crawford’s face with tiny bits of paper (it took me a long time to get the color luminous enough), that equality was the wrong paradigm, the wrong thing to be looking for in every intimate connection between two people. Crawford wasn’t just close to Houston’s genius, proximate to it, she it, she created the conditions under which it was possible. “I really feel,” R&B and Houston’s husband Bobby Brown said in 2016, “that if Robyn was accepted into Whitney’s life, Whitney would still be alive today.” That too, I saw, is a kind of art. I studied many loving second fiddles during that first part of the pandemic, but these are the ones that come back. As summer turned to fall and then finally into winter, I kept collaging and something new settled inside me. I felt able now to see the thing which was no longer a hypothesis, that good art is often made in the unique forcefield that rises up between two people rather than inside one person alone. As I began to write into the novel in earnest, I listened over and over again to “For What It’s Worth” by Stevie Nicks: “I got to sing, I got to dance/I got to be a part of a great romance...What you did was: you saved my life/I won’t forget it.” Aha, I thought! I had arrived, in the “I” of the lover. I kept going. The fiddles became . __________________________________",

        "content": "In November 1960, almost a year to date after William Koshland, longtime staffer at Knopf, delivered the manuscript of the book that would become to editor Judith Jones, he stopped by her desk with another book in hand. This one was slim—a collection of poetry, Koshland said. Judith’s love of verse was almost as well-known around the office as her interest in food. Koshland said the volume was the poet’s debut. It had just been published in the UK by Heinemann; it wanted to know if Knopf would be interested in purchasing the American rights and publishing the book in the States. Koshland asked Judith if she’d give it a look. Judith set aside the work she’d been doing, opened to the first poem, and read: / The collection was called . Its author was Sylvia Plath. Knopf had had their eye on Plath since 1953, when she’d done a stint as a guest editor at during her summer break from Smith College (whence Julia Child had graduated two decades before). Plath, who’d been placing her stories and poems in national publications since she was a teen, had won her place at the magazine “for smart young women” by submitting a work of short fiction the year before. That piece, which Plath had entered in ’s annual Guest Editor contest and which won first prize and was published therein, had caught the attention of Harold Strauss, at the time, Knopf ’s editor in chief. He’d written to Plath, asking her to keep him abreast of her future work. He said he hoped that one day she would pen a novel Knopf could publish. Plath was flattered but said that, as a student on scholarship, she worked summers to help pay her way, and was “not in the position to concentrate on any sustained writing project as yet.” She thanked Strauss for his confidence in her writing and assured him that, if and when the time came, she would happily submit her novel to Knopf. “I hope within the next few years,” Plath wrote. ’s annual college issue of August 1953 contained three pieces by twenty-year-old Sylvia Plath: an article about notable poets teaching on college campuses; an interview she’d conducted with Knopf author, Elizabeth Bowen; and an original poem titled “Mad Girl’s Love Song”: / / . Plath had suffered from depression and wrestled with mental illness all her life. In her journals and letters, she described that summer of 1953 as one of “pain, parties, and work.” Plath was thrilled to be in the thick of things; she was also overwhelmed. In August, she attempted to take her own life, swallowing a large dose of her mother’s sleeping pills. “I blissfully succumbed to the whirling blackness that I honestly believed was eternal oblivion,” she later wrote. But having taken too many pills, she “vomited them, and came to consciousness in the dark hell.” After her attempted suicide, Plath underwent “therapeutic” treatments of the talk, electroconvulsive, and insulin-shock kinds. Then she returned to Smith for spring term of 1954. She put on a good face, writing an honors thesis on Dostoyevsky and graduating summa cum laude in June 1955. Before graduating, she learned she’d been awarded a Fulbright to study literature at Cambridge starting that fall. There, at a launch party for a student magazine in which she’d published some of her poems, Plath met Ted Hughes. Plath described their first encounter as “cataclysmic.” The couple married in June 1956, less than four months after meeting. Plath and Hughes were both ambitious poets, but in their marriage, Hughes’s work as an artist was prioritized. In addition to writing, Plath also kept house: “chicken & squash ready in the oven for her husband’s return from the library, back achey,” she noted in her journal. Plath enjoyed cooking but resented the scarce time it left her with to write. “Whoa, I said to myself. You will escape into domesticity & stifle yourself by falling headfirst into a bowl of cookie batter,” Plath wrote soon after she and Hughes wed. But in spite of her “disease of doldrums,” and the couple’s geographic upheaval—they moved to the States in 1957 and returned to the UK two years later—Plath kept the plates spinning and muscled on, determined to write. In April 1959, Plath completed her first book of poems and began looking for a publisher, “A much more difficult job for a poetrywriter than a novelist or a children’s book writer,” she wrote in a letter to a friend. That June, she submitted it to Knopf, making good on her word to editor Harold Strauss. Strauss knew little about poetry, and the manuscript was promptly given to Judith. Judith passed on Plath’s collection but was “impressed enough,” Judith later wrote, “to write her, although I did not think she was ready for a collection—at least one that we could do.” That summer, Plath and Hughes moved back to the UK and settled in London’s Chalcot Square. From overseas, following Knopf ’s rejection, Plath submitted her collection to the Viking Press and Farrar, Straus and Cudahy in October 1959. Neither house bit. Plath switched tack to focus on finding a British publisher for her book, while preparing for the arrival of her first child. The writer was twenty-seven when Frieda Rebecca Hughes was born in April 1960. On Halloween of that year, with Frieda just seven months old, Heinemann published Plath’s . When the house sent a copy of the British edition to Knopf for consideration, Koshland promptly handed the collection off to Judith, who he knew had seen the poet’s earlier submission, to assess. Judith spent a month with Plath’s poems, letting the verse sink in. She took it home and shared portions of it with her husband, the writer Richard Evan Jones, who went by Dick. Poetry, like food, was a shared passion of theirs. Often, after dinner, the two would read poems aloud. In December 1960, Judith wrote a report to her colleagues at Knopf about Plath’s book: “This girl is a poet, there is no question about it,” she said. “I think one of the most exciting ones that has emerged in a long time.” Judith was inclined to endorse Knopf ’s acquisition of , but thought they ought to try to get hold of some of Plath’s recent short stories, too. “It would be a sounder investment to launch her if we felt we were getting a potential fiction writer as well.” Publishing poetry was always a risky investment; the form had literary clout, but rarely sold well. Judith did have one reservation about . She felt that “Poem for a Birthday” hewed dangerously close to her former teacher—and lover—Theodore Roethke’s “The Lost Son.” “The birthday poem” seemed “so deliberately stolen,” Judith wrote, “that I would almost fear the charge of plagiarism.” The editor, still gaining confidence at Knopf, suggested that “a pro,” in the field of poetry, “someone like Stanley Kunitz,” be asked to weigh in. Kunitz, who’d won a Pulitzer for his the previous year, knew his friend Roethke’s body of work intimately. Judith wanted to know if Kunitz saw the “imitativeness” in Plath’s poem that she did. In January 1961, Judith sent to Kunitz along with a note: “‘Poem for a Birthday’ at the end of the book is the one I am so uneasy about.” It took Kunitz two months to reply, but when he did, he agreed with Judith both about the collection’s promise and the trouble with the particular poem. With that, Judith felt she had what she needed, and got her superiors’ go-ahead to move on the book. In March 1961, she wrote to Plath. “I feel I have lied [ ] with these poems for a long time now,” she said. “I am convinced that they are remarkably fresh and exciting and vigorous. In fact, I cannot remember when I have been as impressed by any collection of a young poet.” She included her concern about “Poem for a Birthday,” too. “The feeling,” Judith explained, “is that both in terms of imagery and rhyming structure it is so close to Theodore Roethke’s ‘Lost Son’ that people would be likely to pounce on you.” She would hate, Judith said, “to see your book reviewed and have almost all the critics use this as an opening wedge.” She urged Plath to consider cutting the poem for the American edition, and wondered whether she might want to “weed out some of the more uneven poems” while she was at it. “If so, I would be glad to discuss which ones we might sacrifice.” Judith signed off: “I shall be looking forward to hearing from you very anxiously indeed.” Plath was surprised at Judith’s willingness to reconsider her work, and over the moon at the prestigious house of Knopf ’s offer on her book. To her mother, Aurelia, Plath wrote, “GOOD NEWS GOOD NEWS GOOD NEWS...ALFRED KNOPF will publish in America! It is an immense joy to have what I consider THE publisher accept my book for America with such enthusiasm.” When she responded to Judith, Plath conceded, without a whiff of defensiveness, that Judith was right about “Poem for a Birthday.” It was, she admitted, “written under the undiluted influence of Roethke, and I now feel it is too obviously influenced. There are, however,” she added, “two sections of the poem I wonder if you would reconsider and perhaps be willing to publish on their own—‘Flute Notes from a Reedy Pond’ and ‘The Stones.’” Those poems, the poet wrote, had been “written separately and much later than the other five...and have been published as separate poems in America where the others have not.” As for cuts, Plath included a list of the poems she was inclined to cull; it would bring the collection down from the fifty poems in the British edition to forty for the American one, “a good and reasonable number,” she wrote. “I’m eager to hear what you think of these suggestions. As for the rest, I couldn’t be more in agreement with you. Sincerely yours, Sylvia Plath.” Judith concurred with most of Plath’s proposed cuts, although on two, she suggested alternatives instead. “Do think about it,” Judith wrote, “the final decision must, of course, be yours.” Judith wrote that she liked Plath’s idea of printing a trimmed version of “Poem for a Birthday,” too. “I am pleased that our opinions seem to coincide so closely,” Plath responded in May 1961. Their back-and-forth had helped her be more objective about her own work, Plath said, “and will result, I think, in a much stronger and shorter book in America.” So pleased was Plath with her “lady editor”—as she referred to Judith in a letter home, and her astute handling of her work—that she called the collection’s British edition “a trial run.” In August, when ’s contracts were, at last, fully executed, Judith wrote to Plath, “hastening...to let you know that we are scheduling the book for Spring, April 1962 and are ready to put it into production. I am delighted that we are finally underway.” Judith felt the satisfaction of things beginning to click into place. At last, her editorial instincts were coalescing into something real, a work she would be able to hold in her hands and rightfully claim as her own. Judith was still working largely at the Knopfs’ behest, helping support authors given her by Blanche and Alfred and editing under their names. But, quietly and off to the side, Judith was nurturing her own ambitions as well; with Sylvia Plath and Julia Child, she had begun to build her list. The two writers were strategic choices on Judith’s part: low-profile authors whose work, in poetry and food, respectively, existed outside the literary mainstream. As such, Judith was able to work with Plath and Child as she saw fit, with very little oversight from Knopf ’s higher-ups. As long as she fulfilled her obligations to Blanche and Alfred, no one at the house questioned what Judith did with the rest of her time. “I was allowed to do [my] own thing,” Judith told me. Still, she was keenly aware that the reception of Plath’s and ’ cookbook would largely determine her ability to pursue more authors independently. The future of her career at Knopf hinged on her books’ success. And so Judith committed to doing everything in her power to help those books, those authors—and, thus, herself along with them—get ahead. __________________________________",

        "content": "Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to tell business leaders that, having brought business back to Labour , the party can now “bring growth back to Britain” if she gets into No 11. In her first major campaign speech, she will tell voters Labour can be trusted with the economy and that she wants to lead the most “pro-growth Treasury in UK history”. Speaking from Derby, she will stress the need for a partnership with business and workers, saying that a Labour government will offer “a government that is pro-worker and pro-business”. Her remarks come after Labour faced a backlash over an apparent rebranding of its “ New Deal for Workers ”, with Britain’s largest trade union Unite warning that the party must “stick to its guns” on workers’ rights. It comes as the Conservative party is set to unveil a new plan for pensioners in a bid to boost their incomes with a “triple lock plus” pledge . If the Tories are elected, the deal would guarantee that the basic state pension rises by the highest rate of inflation or 2.5 per cent, whichever is the largest increase.",

Disaster management and police officials said that ten bodies have been recovered so far and several others are still trapped under the debris, that collapsed in the morning. District management officials and workers, police and other local people were trying hard to rescue the trapped people. Heavy rain and intense wind speed were affecting the rescue operations, a disaster management official said, adding that they were unaware of how many were still trapped under the debris. According to the officials, seven of the victims are locals, while the remaining are from outside the state. The rain-triggered landslides were reported in several other districts and at least two persons have died elsewhere and disrupted the movement of vehicles between the districts. Several buildings, houses, roads and bridges were swept away due to the landslides and the heavy rain. Mizoram's capital Aizawl has been cut off from the rest of the country due to multiple landslides on National Highway 6, the lifeline of the mountainous state. Chief Minister Lalduhoma held an emergency meeting with state Home Minister K. Sapdanga, Chief Secretary Renu Sharma and other senior officials and reviewed the situation. Mizoram Chief Minister has announced a fund of Rs 15 crore to provide relief to the affected people and an ex gratia of Rs 4 lakh each would be given to the kin of those who died in the landslides. All schools were closed and government employees, except those involved in providing emergency and essential services, were asked to work from home.",

        "content": "The Department of Parliamentary Services boss, Rob Stefanic, has denied having a romantic relationship with his then subordinate, telling Senate estimates he formally declared a conflict of interest only due to “gossip” and “rumour”. Senate estimates heard on Tuesday that Stefanic declared a conflict due to his personal relationship with Cate Saunders, a former deputy secretary in the department, in August 2022. The hearing was told Stefanic remained her boss for eight months until she was seconded to another agency. Saunders was on secondment at Services Australia until she accepted a $315,126 incentive payment for her retirement from the public service on 1 October 2023, the hearing was told. The exit package was approved by the Department of Parliamentary Services. Stefanic told the hearing he was not involved in its signoff. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Appearing at estimates on Tuesday, Stefanic initially declined to respond to questions about his personal life. Citing a report in The Australian, the One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts asked Stefanic whether he had had a romantic relationship with Saunders. Stefanic said: “I’ll give you a simple answer, senator, and that is no.” Stefanic told the Senate the media’s reporting of the allegations amounted to a “repeated violation” of his personal life and that he had “unsuccessfully tried to communicate to members of the media that I’ve taken all reasonable steps to declare all conflicts of interest as appropriate”. Under questioning by senators, Stefanic said he made a formal declaration of conflict to the then Australian Public Service commissioner, Peter Woolcott, in regards to the personal relationship with Saunders in August 2022 but said there was no documentation of it to his knowledge. The Greens senator Barbara Pocock queried how Stefanic and Saunders continued to work together for a period of eight months after the declaration was made and before Saunders left the DPS. Stefanic told Senate estimates the process to make alternative arrangements, including to move Saunders elsewhere, “took time” and was not “a matter of simply moving someone on day two”. “So, for the eight months where you were the manager in this relationship, how did you manage the conflict of interest within that eight-month period?” Pocock asked. Stefanic responded that the working relationship between the secretary and deputy secretary was “transactional” and that his dealings with Saunders as her boss during that period were “purely administrative in nature”. Stefanic said those administrative matters were mostly to do with the approval of personal leave. Asked by the Liberal senator Jane Hume why he had made a formal conflict of interest declaration if there had been no romantic relationship, Stefanic said: “I thought it was necessary given that I anticipated that that gossip and rumour would at some point come out in this forum. “And I felt it was important procedurally that – it was probably time for me to seek some advice.” He added that there were “perceptions of a close relationship” and that rumour “morphs into fact in people’s eyes”. Hume asked: “So you were declaring that others thought that there was a relationship, but there wasn’t one?” Stefanic responded: “What there was is a close friendship.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She was later made the deputy secretary in 2020 but left the DPS for a temporary secondment at Services Australia in April 2023. The DPS is exempt from freedom of information laws. According to a leaked conflicts of interest policy document for DPS employees, seen by Guardian Australia, senior officials, including the secretary and the parliamentary librarian, are required to submit written declarations to parliament’s presiding officers for assessment. “Avoiding all conflicts of interest, real or apparent, is not always feasible. Where conflicts of interest are identified, they should be handled in an open and transparent way that can be understood and defended,” the document reads. “In rare circumstances, employees may need to consider changing roles within DPS or DPS may need to reassign the employee to other duties.” Asked by Guardian Australia if all processes were followed correctly last year, the presiding officers – the Senate president, Sue Lines, and the speaker, Milton Dick – said they “have sought advice from the Australian Public Service commissioner on the matters that have been raised”. “The commissioner was satisfied that all processes were followed,” Lines and Dick said in a statement last week. A DPS spokesperson told Guardian Australia Stefanic “maintained a professional working relationship with Ms Saunders for a number of years” before her move to Services Australia. “The secretary declares all relevant relationships in the appropriate manner. No formal complaints have been made in relation to the above-referenced conflict of interest,” the spokesperson said in early May. – Additional reporting by Josh Butler",

        "content": "UK holidaymakers are being left baffled by mobile roaming charges in the European Union - risking hefty bills abroad. A study of 2,000 mobile phone users found 63 per cent are confused by the cost of using their phone abroad, with 59 per cent of these not knowing how much data they use. 55 per cent don't know how texts and calls are charged and 54 per cent don't know if roaming charges are already covered in their mobile plan. 58 per cent are confusedby how they will be charged and if it’s a daily cost or a cost per gigabyte they use. It means over half are paying £24, on average, for using their phone abroad on a single trip. But one in 20 (four per cent) have ended up with a bill exceeding £120. Sarah McGarr, chief digital officer at the travel eSIM provider, said: “Everyone loves jetting off on holiday, but it’s evident people like to keep in touch with what’s going on back home and in the world around them wherever they are, and that they rely on data for all sorts of holiday essentials – from maps to translations to transport. So our mobiles really are crucial while abroad. READ MORE Brits in Spain and Portugal told to prepare for 'dramatic' shift starting today “But it’s hard to know what you’re going to need your phone for until you reach your destination so it’s easy to be unprepared and not consider how much it might end up costing you.” Sarah from Sim Local added: “Our research paints a clear picture – travellers are increasingly perplexed when it comes to understanding the complexities of roaming and data usage abroad. “With people jetting off more than ever, getting your data plans sorted before you travel is almost as important as remembering to pack your passport. Otherwise, the lasting memory of what should have been a highlight of the year, is actually the costly pitfalls you came home to. “eSIMs are an increasingly popular way to avoid any pitfalls as they allow you to automatically switch between cost-effective mobile networks without replacing your physical SIM card. In fact, eSIM use globally is predicted to rise by almost 440% by 2028.\"",

        "content": "It’s almost impossible to grasp how deeply theater was woven into the fabric of American life, from coastal cities to frontier towns, before the rise of Hollywood. It helps to see this through the eyes of a young woman, born in 1873, who grew up in Red Cloud, Nebraska, went to college in the state capitol, Lincoln, and as an undergraduate began reviewing local productions for the . Lincoln had fallen on hard times in the 1890s, its population dropping sharply from fifty‐five thousand to forty thousand in the course of that decade due to an extended drought and a nationwide economic depression. Despite financial hardship, a great many people in Lincoln continued to flock to the theater, frequenting the Funke Opera House as well as the newer Lansing Theatre. The two houses could hold well over three thousand playgoers, and there were smaller venues in town as well. Remarkably, for a rural and mostly agricultural state with just over a million inhabitants, Nebraska had more than fifty playhouses in 1890, with new ones being built as rail service made transportation faster and more dependable, enabling some of the finest talent in the country to tour the state. That young theater reviewer in Lincoln was the future novelist Willa Cather, later celebrated for her portrayal of frontier life. In the course of one especially busy week in April 1894, Cather reviewed five plays: (one of America’s earliest musicals), (another New York transfer, which played to “uttermost capacity”), (“the best comic opera of this or of many seasons,” that also played to “a packed” house), (by Martha Morton, one of America’s first women playwrights), and (a “ponderous and patriotic” melodrama). On top of that she took in a minstrel show at the Lyceum Hall. Cather reports that the run of plays seems to have lifted spirits in town: “Despite the sleepiness which is a necessary result of attending five good plays in one week everyone seems more cheerful for the dissipation.” Twenty‐five hundred playgoers could cram into the Lansing for a standing‐room‐only show, paying from twenty‐five cents to a dollar. With at least two packed shows and three at half capacity, it’s likely that eight thousand tickets were sold that week at the Lansing (the aging Funke, which would soon be refurbished, was dark). If you subtract the third of the population not yet fifteen years old, so likely too young to spend an evening at the theater, and subtract as well those too old or infirm, you are left with roughly thirty thousand adults who could go to the theater (and many, like Cather, went more than once). So it’s likely that as many as one in four adults in Lincoln went to a play that week, a percentage approaching a theatergoing intensity not seen since London in Shakespeare’s day. Lincoln was not exceptional; playgoing was a national pastime. In 1896 Julius Cahn published the first of his annual . Cahn listed every town in every state that had a playhouse, and provided information on train schedules, hotel accommodations, stage dimensions, admission charges, and much else. Cather’s reflections on the recent season in Lincoln in 1894, in which dozens of companies had passed through town, convey the effect of this touring on rural America: “There were poor companies here, but there were also good ones,” and she writes excitedly about the international stars of the stage, including Sarah Bernhardt, who reportedly “will play in all the smaller cities of America and will, of course, include Lincoln in her dates.” A local historian recalled that a “list of the names of the players who came to Lincoln in those days reads like a Who’s Who of the American stage.” Acting companies touring Nebraska knew that even small towns had their own theaters; Red Cloud, where Cather grew up, with a population of two thousand, had its own opera house that could seat eight hundred. Looking back years later, Cather recalled how her town’s “opera house was dark for most of the year, but that made its events only the more exciting. Half a dozen times each winter—in the larger towns more oftener—a traveling stock company settled down at the local hotel and thrilled and entertained us for a week.” Theater connected Americans, and Cather took care to keep her readers abreast of the latest news about actors and plays from California and Texas to Chicago and New York. For Cather, “the people of this century have a right to demand something that is close to them, something that touches their everyday life,” and touring companies provided that. Cather, who kept one eye fixed on the stage, the other on the audience, provides a rich sense of the social cohesion that theater was forging, which rival forms of entertainment (including college football, then in its infancy in Nebraska) could not match. Those of different social classes mingled and interacted, often noisily, in the playhouse. She describes nights when “the sons and daughters of toil greatly predominated,” the “kind of people who know how to enjoy themselves and who are thoroughly uncorrupted by any suspicion of taste,” who felt “at liberty at any time to call out the approval or disapproval in not unmistakable terms.” For those born abroad (and at this time perhaps a quarter of those living in Nebraska were European immigrants, for many of whom English was not their native language), theater helped overcome this barrier. There weren’t many Black people living in Lincoln at this time, but Cather’s reviews—in one of which she describes the reaction of “a big happy negro” sitting in the front row of the Lansing balcony—confirm that casual racism persisted, and that its theaters were integrated. Cather also describes amateur performances, including one by members of the Nebraska National Guard, the Lincoln Light Infantry. And the wall between town and gown was breached when a “full standing capacity” crowd at the Lansing came to see students from the university perform plays by Plautus and Sophocles in the original Latin and Greek. It’s hard not to feel the infectiousness of playgoing in Lincoln at this time, across the social spectrum, captured by Cather in her description of those who came to see a song‐and‐dance revue, , at the Lansing in late September 1894. It was, she wrote, “one of the happiest crowds ever gathered in Lincoln. It was of course top‐heavy, the gallery element predominating. The gallery was full, so full it could not contain itself....It was a glorious audience, downstairs and up...the kind that can’t stand a specialty performance without something elevating and classical, something Shakespearean....It was a wildly enthusiastic audience; it enjoyed itself and it got its money’s worth.” Even as automobiles were replacing the horse and buggy, movies were displacing theatrical performances across America. In 1900, nearly four hundred acting companies crisscrossed the country; two decades later that figure had dropped to forty‐two, and by 1935, half that. One of the most knowledgeable writers on theater at the turn of the century, William Winter, recalled that in 1880 there had been as many as five thousand theaters in 3,500 locales. If Winter’s estimate is accurate, roughly a third of American towns and cities had hosted theaters, quite a few of them, like Lincoln, more than one. Close to half these theaters had resident stock companies, a cohort of local actors who were a bedrock of the local arts community. While there had been roughly 2,000 permanent stock companies in 1910, by 1923 only 133 remained, a hollowing out of local culture. By 1925, according to , the number of playhouses outside major cities had dropped to 674. Many had been turned into cinemas. A decade later, Thomas Gale Moore writes in , “the total of stock, repertory and tent theaters had dwindled to 110.” Outside of big cities, playgoing was fast disappearing, and part of the decline was self‐inflicted, grounded in the conviction that theater, as Alfred L. Bernheim writes at the time in , is “necessarily commercial,” so it was natural for there to be a drive to consolidate control of the industry in the hands of the few, in this case the powerful Theatrical Syndicate, established in 1896, a monopolization of power and profit that rendered the entire system vulnerable. The bottom seems to have fallen out in 1910 or so, the year in which Julius Cahn stopped publishing his annual guides. That year nearly 30 million Americans were going to the movies every week; admission was seven cents, a fraction of what a theater ticket cost. Those attendance numbers doubled by 1927 and nearly doubled again to 110 million in 1929 after talkies were introduced (at which point admission, now that serious competition from plays was gone, had risen to a quarter). It meant that on the eve of the Depression, on average, nearly every American—the population in 1930 was 123 million—went to the movies once a week. Even during the depths of the Depression that figure only dipped to 80 million or so. Hollywood soon elbowed its way onto Broadway, bankrolling shows at a loss, using theaters to try out plots and talent‐hunt for actors, writers, and directors. In 1929, reflecting on how film “has put an end to the old‐fashioned road companies which used to tour about in country towns,” Cather lamented what was lost. Having witnessed these changes, and having been so marked by theater herself, she was sensitive to the cost of Hollywood’s triumph. For her, film didn’t quite measure up: “Only a living human being in some sort of rapport with us, speaking the lines, can make us forget who we are and where we are, can make us (especially children) actually live in the story that is going on before us, can make the dangers of that heroine and the desperation of that hero much more important to us, for the time much dearer to us, than our own lives.” “Cinematic “pictures of them, no matter how dazzling, do not make us feel anything more than interest or curiosity or astonishment.” It was the touring actors who embodied for Cather “the old glory of the drama in its great days,” and “why its power was more searching than that of printed books or paintings because a story of human experience was given to us alive, given to us, not only by voice and attitude, but by all those unnamed ways in which an animal of any species makes known its terror or misery to other animals of its kind.” She would find herself studying the audiences who went to the movies, even as she had once watched fellow playgoers, and put her finger on the difference: “I see easy, careless attention, amusement, occasionally a curiosity that amounts to mild excitement; but never that breathless, rapt attention and deep feeling that the old barnstorming companies were able to command....Only real people speaking the lines can give us that feeling of living along with them, of participating in their existence.” When, in 1936, the Federal Theatre “brought the theatre back to the people” of Nebraska and, as the added, “filled, to some extent, the gap that was made when the movies took over,” it was for many something new and strange: “Our actors” in Nebraska, Hallie Flanagan writes, “found that 90 per cent of their audience had never seen a play and could not believe that the actors were not moving pictures. After each performance they would wait in the doorway to see ‘whether the people are real.’” It’s hard to determine how many Americans still earned a living in theater in the early decades of the twentieth century or how many had drifted away into other jobs before the Depression hit. Even in the best of times, there were always actors looking for work. In 1920, the U.S. Census counted 48,172 “actors and showmen,” of which 28,361 were actors, including, presumably, those employed in film. No unemployment figures were given. A decade later, the 1930 census lumped together “actors and showmen,” reporting that there were over 75,000, with 64,695 currently employed. If the proportion of actors and showmen remained the same, that meant there were roughly 38,000 actors. In 1932, more than 22,000 of them, hungry for work, had registered with Hollywood casting bureaus, though few would find employment, almost all as extras. It wasn’t just actors who had depended on theater for their livelihood; there were also playwrights, prop makers, musicians, prompters, stagehands, producers, ushers, designers, managers, carpenters, bill posters, advertising agents, scenic artists, electricians, dancers, and costume makers. Thirty‐five separate unions represented these and other workers, from the Ushers, Doormen and Cashier’s Union to Actors’ Equity. With theater in decline, many no doubt used their skills to seek employment in other fields, including film and radio, which was still possible when the national unemployment rate remained, on the average, around 5 percent from 1900 to 1929. But when that percentage spiked to nearly 16 percent in 1931, and then climbed to an unprecedented 25 percent in 1933, there were very few jobs of any kind available. In New York City that year, impoverished actors lined up for clothing, cash, and the three hundred thousand meals dispensed by the Stage Relief Fund and the Actors’ Dinner Club. Several things, all of them unprecedented, had to fall into place before this crisis would lead to the creation of the Federal Theatre. The first was a radical shift in relief policy, providing jobs for the unemployed rather than, as in the past, putting them “on the dole.” “Work relief,” an oxymoron for many, was a new concept, driven largely by the emerging influence of social workers whose experience of the early years of the Depression had convinced them, as one put it, that if you give “a man a dole and you save his body and destroy his soul,” but “give him a job and pay him an assured wage, and you save both the body and the spirit.” But, since work relief cost more than handouts, there had to be political will to legislate it, and a leader and a political party bold enough to dispense funds, given the entrenched hostility to such policies by business interests fearful of their impact on the labor market. Taxpayers and legislators then had to be convinced of the value of giving a paycheck to unemployed violinists to perform concerts and actors to stage plays, rather than, as one unnamed congressman put it, handing them shovels and expecting them to dig ditches. Concerns about the government getting into the theater business—especially from unions worried about lower salaries and those who ran commercial theaters opposed to subsidized competition—also had to be allayed. The only time in American history that all these factors aligned, briefly, was the mid‐1930s. __________________________________",

        "description": "Kafka claims in a letter to Milena Jesenská, his girlfriend and first translator, that the emotional cohesion of “The Judgment” is evident in “every sentence, every word, every—if I may say so—music.” Kafka could hear that “music” in Jesenská’s Czech translation, although he would have initially preferred to hear the voice of his beloved: “I [...]",
        "content": "Kafka claims in a letter to Milena Jesenská, his girlfriend and first translator, that the emotional cohesion of “The Judgment” is evident in “every sentence, every word, every—if I may say so—music.” Kafka could hear that “music” in Jesenská’s Czech translation, although he would have initially preferred to hear the voice of his beloved: “I wanted to hear from you and not the voice from the old grave, the voice I know all too well.” His high praise of Jesenská’s translation could only have come from a polyglot writer, who spoke Czech in addition to his native German, had a sophisticated understanding of the translator’s task, and whose writing straddles linguistic and cultural boundaries. Anyone who attempts a new translation of Kafka owes a great debt to the work of Willa and Edwin Muir, who created the remarkably elegant, and, for the better part of the twentieth-century, canonical English-language translations of Kafka. As first translators, the Muirs needed to introduce their unsettling author to English-speaking readers and creatively adapted some of Kafka’s stylistic idiosyncrasies. We latter-day translators of this now classic modern writer are perhaps a little freer to stretch English in our inevitably less than successful attempts to echo Kafka’s austere music, his singular voice, and his rhythmic accumulation of logically sequenced detail. For, as Milan Kundera reminds us in an essay on French translations of “every author of some value transgresses against ‘good style’ and in that transgression lies the originality (and hence the raison d’être) of his art.” I would add that we translators, and indeed readers, too, need to pay close attention not only to the surface of Kafka’s stories, but also to what he, in a letter to Jesenská, calls their “subterranean passages.” Although Kafka absorbed the work of an eclectic assortment of classical and modern writers—Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Heinrich von Kleist, Adalbert Stifter, Charles Dickens, Gustave Flaubert, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Robert Walser—he developed a unique style, which owes something to the precise, limpid prose that he honed in his official reports at his day job as a lawyer. In his fiction, he manages to sound at once dry and impersonal while retaining many of the idiosyncrasies that are familiar to readers of his diaries and letters. His is often a diffident voice which keeps questioning itself, retracting even hesitant assertions. His style in these stories ranges from the stately prose in the opening lines of “The Judgment” to the dramatic and almost cinematic as well as occasionally bureaucratic style of “The Transformation” through the painful precision and evasive obfuscation of “In the Penal Colony” to an ape’s humorously pedantic and slightly stilted speech in “A Report for an Academy.” In translating the stories in , I have resisted the temptation to make the English more vivid, expressive, and colorful than Kafka’s plain and understated German. That plainness was a deliberate choice, a rejection of the “high-flown stuff” (almost none of which has survived) that he wrote as a youth while he still was, as he put it, “mad about grand phrases.” Kafka’s usually clear and dispassionate tone—Samuel Beckett, who read in German, called it “almost serene”—heightens the uncanniness of the events depicted in his stories while also enabling us readers to detach ourselves from the protagonist and to perceive layers of irony and, yes, humor hidden in the interstices of his sentences. A translator’s effort to recreate the disparate effects of these styles is at least partly foredoomed by the distance between languages, even those so closely related as are English and German. Take, for instance, syntax: Kafka, and indeed German literary convention, is famously partial to long sentences, which I have tried to mimic, even though they challenge contemporary English-language preferences. Kafka’s blurring of the line between the perspective of the generally unobtrusive narrator and that of the main character, through whose point of view many of the stories in this selection are largely told, poses another challenge for the translator. Even within the same sentence Kafka can switch back and forth between those two perspectives, and the narrator’s drily impersonal diction often gives way to the more colloquial language that conveys the protagonist’s thoughts and ruminations. In stories told in the first-person, there are some abrupt changes of tense, from past to present, which are as startling in German as they are in English. I have also tried to reflect, at least partly, Kafka’s shifting choices when it comes to punctuation: while sparse and mostly reliant on commas in some stories, in others such as “The Transformation” it can be quite heavy, with abundant semicolons. Another challenge for the translator is how to render little words informally known as “flavoring particles,” which carry a range of possible meanings, such as (perhaps, probably, indeed) and (however, but, indeed, after all). Whereas careless writers of German sprinkle such words into their writing with abandon, Kafka deploys them with characteristic precision and so the translator needs to figure out from the context which of the multiple meanings of those little words makes the most sense. The stories, arranged in the sequence in which they were written, include some of Kafka’s best-known tales and others which are not quite so familiar. The emphasis is on stories written between 1912, the year in which he wrote “The Transformation” (usually translated as “The Metamorphosis”) and “The Judgment,” and 1924, the year of Kafka’s premature death of tuberculosis at the age of forty. My translation generally follows the German critical editions, which have removed the stylistic varnish, as it were, added by Max Brod, Kafka’s close friend, posthumous editor, and first biographer. While working on this project, I kept discovering new things about Kafka that I had missed in four decades reading, teaching, and writing about his work. My hope is that readers of will also make their own discoveries as they find their way through those “subterranean passages.” ______________________________",

        "description": "Its corporate plan sees these 35 store closures continuing for much of the next two years.",
        "content": "To turn around Pick n Pay and restore profitability, the group will shut 35 stores and convert another roughly 70 to the mass-market Boxer brand (in areas where this makes sense) or to PnP franchise operators. ALSO READ: SA Inc can learn from Pick n Pay’s Ackerman In total, more than 100 stores will be converted or closed. This is a sizeable chunk of its current footprint – it only has 300 company-owned PnP supermarkets in South Africa. The closures amount to approximately 10% of its owned store base. In just the coming months, it will shut at least 14 supermarkets, with another “more than 10” to be converted to Boxer. Its corporate plan sees these 35 store closures continuing for much of the next two years. However, its franchise store footprint of nearly 200 supermarkets in SA will mean that its overall number of stores – as experienced by its customers – won’t decrease as drastically. ALSO READ: Ackerman family steps back from majority control of Pick n Pay In total, it owns 982 stores in the country, but this includes Clothing and Liquor outlets. Pick n Pay rebrand QualiSave is dead and these stores are being rebranded back to Pick n Pay. The core problem is that the range of goods in these outlets was cut too severely which negatively impacted margins, which then led to them turning unprofitable. ALSO READ: Pick n Pay technically insolvent, but new strategic plan will turn the ship Some of these QualiSave stores are obvious candidates for conversion to Boxer, which operates at a structurally lower cost base in each store. He says that, in general, its franchisees have been able to get “another 10% to 15% in revenue” out of one of their stores (versus a corporate one) and that these tend to be 33% to 50% smaller than corporate supermarkets. This means far better trading densities, and profits. Summers concedes that stores that turn over between R8 million and R10 million a month are “not particularly profitable for us” but for franchise operators with their “own skin in the game” this is different. ALSO READ: Pick n Pay recalls peanut butter due to high levels of aflatoxin Pick n Pay “fell behind in keeping stores fresh and modern,” says Summers. Falling behind saw its “spirit diminished over time”. In effect, he says, this caused a breach of trust: “Pick n Pay broke its relationship with the consumer.” This is what it is determined to repair. The group will “reverse” certain decisions that have been taken in recent years and plans a renewed focus on bakery, butchery, produce and deli. Customer service Some cuts that have been made to support functions over the last five to 10 years have been very damaging, says Summers. “If you show me an unhappy store, I’ll show you poor leadership and support.” It is no secret that it has to fix service and the perceptions around customer service at its stores. It will retrain frontline staff and ensure that customer service managers have a constant presence in store. Tied to this is driving accountability across roles. ALSO READ: Pick n Pay takes another thumping from Checkers Summers says Pick n Pay has already seen a turnaround, but that it remains early days. What he and the executive team are looking for is “significant, consistent and sustainable change”. In the first 12 weeks of this financial year – from March onwards – like-for-like sales at Pick n Pay stores are up (overall, there has been a slight decline due to store closures). It describes this as a “material improvement” versus the drop in the same period last year. This turnaround will take three years, by which time Summers will depart, and a clear succession path is in place for the group’s leadership. In this financial year, it still sees the group burning R1 billion in cash (after capex), less than half the R2.4 billion rate from last year. ALSO READ: Pick n Pay reports substantial losses, declares no dividend In FY26, it is targeting breakeven on a cash flow basis (after costs related to capex and the restructuring plan), while in the year to February 2027 it is targeting Pick n Pay to deliver a trading profit. Rights issue The rights issue and the IPO of Boxer will raise between R10 billion and R12 billion. After getting rid of its R6 billion in net debt and the R1 billion in cash it will need this year, it will spend the remainder on the restructuring plan and its PnP store estate. Summers describes the competitive landscape – with the formidable and arguably ‘unstoppable’ Checkers that has consistently been taking market share – as “fast evolving”. He stresses that PnP won’t be dragged into a race to see who can have the most stores. He says the group needs “profitable, meaningful stores” that serve communities in which they operate on a sustainable basis. Currently, some areas are “horribly over-traded”.

Writing on his personal X account (28 May),...The post Everton make approach to sign Bundesliga attacker, transfer is planned - Sky Sports appeared first on Goodison News.",
        "content": "Writing on his (28 May), the Sky Sports Germany journalist reports that the 25-year-old is expected to leave his current club this summer in a deal worth around £5.9million. Villarreal, Fiorentina, Geona and Galatasaray have also made inquiries for the winger, who registered eight goals and 13 assists in the Bundesliga this season, but the player’s preference is to stay in Germany’s top flight. The Toffees had a good season in 2023/24 when full context is considered, as they avoided relegation with three games to spare despite having eight points deducted from their total. They also went on a run of just one win in 15 games at one point too, but Dyche helped them to claim several wins that weren’t expected and now they will look to push on further this summer. The main problem the club had was their lack of goals in attack with Dominic Calvert-Lewin going on a barren run of over 20 games without a goal, and now both Jack Harrison and Arnaut Danjuma’s loans have ended meaning the squad is even weaker. 🔴 A transfer in the summer is still planned for Jan-Niklas ! ➡️ Contract until 2025. Discussions are ongoing. Specific inquiries from: , , , and ! ➡️ However at this stage, the 25 y/o winger (8 goals/13 assists)... Dyche is said to be keen to re-sign Harrison on a season-long loan once more from Leeds, but bringing in Beste would provide extra quality and depth and for a relatively cheap fee too. He is clearly very creative and has a good eye for goal, and at 25 he has got plenty room for further improvement too. This could be a shrewd bit of business if they can get it over the line.

        "description": "Over the past year, India has found itself at the epicentre of Western allegations, coupled with old friend camaraderie with Pakistani",
        "content": "New Delhi: Over the past year, India has found itself at the epicentre of Western allegations, coupled with old friend camaraderie with Pakistani generals accusing Indian officials of undermining the sovereignties of nations by purportedly engaging in the termination of terrorists in Canada, the US, and Pakistan. This intimidating interest in alleged Indian clandestine security operations, raises pivotal questions about the underlying motives and the broader global dynamics at play. Concurrently, it signals India's ascendance in the realm of global security as a revitalised and influential force, unsettling the traditional West-centric world order. In an era where the global threat landscape is increasingly complex, global and interconnected, India's extraordinary criminal justice measures to neutralise terrorists over the past decade - such as the September 29, 2016 surgical strike on terror launchpads across the Line of Control in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, and the 2019 airstrike on the Jaish-e-Mohammed training camp in Balakot, Pakistan - are particularly significant. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , these operations had shed the \"outdated and reluctant\" image of Indian security agencies of the past, showcasing new India's capability and resolve. The operations were conducted with a notable degree of professionalism, responsibility and transparency, as the Indian PM informed his Pakistani counterpart before disclosing them to the world. These actions not only announced Bharat's arrival as a formidable security force, but also challenged the traditional West-centric world order. Recent Western allegations, devoid of substantive evidence as seen in opinion-heavy reporting of 'The Guardian' claiming India's role in tens of terrorist terminations in Pakistan, a covert unseen Five Eyes network intelligence report regarding the killing of Canadian terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar and subsequent local vote-bank influence as evidenced in Canada, along with the case involving the alleged attempted assassination of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, the US-based face of the proscribed terrorist entity Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), appear to be part of a broader strategy aimed at exerting collective pressure and undermining India's assertive stance against terrorism. India which has long been a victim of cross-border terrorism orchestrated by Pakistan and its extensive global terror network, which includes Canadian and American terrorists. Canadian terrorists like Talwinder Singh Parmar of Babbar Khalsa masterminded the 1985 bombing of Air India Flight 182, claiming 329 innocent lives. Similarly, American terrorists like David Coleman Headley and his Canadian accomplice Tahawwur Rana played pivotal roles in the dastardly 2008 Mumbai attacks by Lashkar-e-Taiba, resulting in 175 deaths and over 300 injuries. More recent attacks, such as the 2016 Uri assault by Pakistan-backed Jaish-e-Mohammed, which killed 19 Indian soldiers and injured 30, and the 2019 Pulwama suicide bombing by Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba, which took the lives of over 40 Indian police personnel, underscore the persistent threat India faces. In this context, India's measures acknowledged criminal justice measures like those listed above to protect itself are not only moral and lawful but also a national security imperative. However, the coordinated Western and Pakistani allegations involving unravelings like Nijjar's assassination in Canada, an attempted assassination of Pannun, and tens of terrorist killings in Pakistan appear more fixed on challenging the newfound capabilities of India's security apparatus under Prime Minister Modi. This stance appears discordant with traditional security superpowers that often perceive national security as their exclusive domain. Most importantly, India's strategic partnerships with various nations, including those in the West, are built on mutual respect and shared interests. These alliances are grounded in a mutual commitment to promoting global stability, economic development, and security. However, for these relationships to thrive and be truly effective, they must be free from unwarranted accusations and intimidation that can undermine trust and cooperation. Unsubstantiated allegations and politicised narratives not only strain diplomatic ties but also detract from the collaborative efforts needed to combat terrorism effectively. By fostering an environment of mutual trust and respect, Western nations and India can work together to dismantle terrorist networks, prevent radicalisation and enhance global security. In conclusion, it is imperative that Western nations avoid actions that could be perceived as coercive or dismissive of India's security concerns. Instead, they should prioritize engagement that is based on equality, respect, and a shared commitment to eradicating terrorism. By doing so, they not only reinforce their alliances with India but also bolster the collective ability to address and overcome the multifaceted challenges posed by terrorism in the 21st century. It is time for the international community to support India's efforts to create a secure and stable world, acknowledging that a strong and secure Bharat is beneficial for global peace and prosperity.

        "content": "\"Can't believe this happened. What a decent bloke. We had a nice chat too\" Coldplay frontman Chris Martin helped a fan “struggling to walk” over the weekend, by giving them a surprise lift to a show. The gesture took place over the weekend, just before the band took to the stage at BBC Radio 1’s Big Weekend for a headline set. According to Saundra Glenn – a fan sharing an update on X/Twitter yesterday (May 27) – the singer went out of his way to pick her up in a Mercedes when he saw that she had mobility issues. Alongside a selfie Glenn shared, which saw her posing with Martin in the car, she also revealed more details about the encounter in the caption. “That moment when Chris Martin @Coldplay saw me struggling to walk, had his car stop and gave me a lift. Blooming amazing,” she wrote. “Can’t believe this happened. What a decent bloke. We had a nice chat too.” The Luton local has also gone on to share more about the frontman coming to her aid in an interview with the BBC , revealing that she struggles with osteoarthritis and “a dodgy right hip”. On the day, she explained, she had paused to rest while on the way to the show, when the Mercedes pulled up next to her and Martin invited her in. That moment when Chris Martin @Coldplay saw me struggling to walk, had his car stop and gave me a lift. Blooming amazing. Can't believe this happened. What a decent bloke ❤️ We had a nice chat too. He is single and likes #Luton 😉 Thx again @BBCR1 . #BigWeekend #SeeMyLuton pic.twitter.com/Fb9itT43LY — Saundra Glenn 💙 (@OfficialSaundra) May 26, 2024 “When we got to the artist area, he didn’t leave me there, he said, ‘Get the golf buggy and make sure Saundra reaches her destination,'” she recalled to the outlet. “It’s the fact he’s conscious of disability, he’s such a kind person... “He gave me an act of kindness that I’ll forever be grateful for, and he’s given Luton its cool back, thank you.” Coldplay would then go on to make headlines again, as they played a huge, career-spanning set to the crowd as part of their headline show, and briefly made a nod to the local football team . Addressing the crowd, the band noted the amount of press Coldplay had received pleading them to change the lyrics for their hit ‘Yellow’ to ‘Orange’ , the home colours of Luton Town FC. Though Coldplay did go on to play ‘Yellow’ unchanged, Martin did roll out a special song he wrote in honour of the Hatters, fittingly called ‘Orange’. “ We didn’t win all our matches, we didn’t win the cup / But when you get knocked down in Luton, you always get back up! ” and “ I was born in love with Luton, and I’m always gonna be ” he sang. During the set, the band also caught fans off guard by bringing out ‘Espresso’ hitmaker Sabrina Carpenter for a surprise guest appearance. The collaboration saw her perform Coldplay’s song ‘Magic’ at their headline set .",

        "content": "I was twelve. It was 1993 and we were in far rural northern California in a town called Weed that looked about like it sounded. It was winter, I think, which in 1993, still meant blizzards, and dirty snowbanks piled high at the edges of the road. In the distance, the sun set behind Mount Shasta, backlighting her ethereal silhouette in luminous oranges and pinks. Inside, I lingered outside Mom’s prayer-room door. I could just make out the low hum of her voice on the phone. She’d been doing this more. Having hushed conversations behind closed doors. I pressed my ear closer to listen. “It’s a past-life thing,” she was saying. Her voice husky and conspiratorial. When I was sure she’d hung up, I waited a beat, knocked, and walked in. A sliver of space between the bathroom and the stairs to my room, the prayer room was herd sanctuary—the only space in the house she’d claimed as her own. Every day, she’d slip away, shutting the hollow door to pray or chant or decree or whatever she was into at the time. Technically, she was just on the other side of the door, but she was gone. In the place where we couldn’t reach her. The one I never fully understood. In the center of the room, was a patio chair draped with an afghan, where she sat to read. Along the windowsill, saint cards were lined up like family portraits: Joan of Arc; Archangel Michael; Saint Francis, the first Catholic stigmatic. Mom’s heroes weren’t girlboss CEOs or flamboyant artists or extraordinary homemakers. She venerated those who had or were willing to suffer for a larger purpose. Those who’d been misunderstood. Persecuted. Religious texts and thrift-store esoterica were stacked against the walls like cairns. Books she’d schlepped from home to home in our constant moves: ; , a text “channeled” by Helen Schucman, the Columbia University psychologist who claimed Jesus spoke to her; the foundational text of Mary Baker Eddy’s controversial belief in mind over matter. Sometimes, if she wasn’t in the room, I’d flip through whatever book was splayed open on her chair. Scanning arcane words she’d underlined— —I tried to dissect them like a code. To find something that would explain where she went when she stopped talking mid-conversation, her sentences hanging in midair. She was studying the divine, and I was studying her—the scripture of a mother adrift. Trying to see where it might lead, and if I should follow. In another life, she might have been a scholar. In this one, I think she was reading to survive. Twenty years later, my mother will be dead, and I, ravenous for data to steady my churning grief, will sit alone on the floor of Powell’s Book in Portland, Oregon, trying to answer the question seeded in her prayer room: Where did she go? I was looking back at my life with a new lens, now, with a theory—schizophrenia. The therapist said that she was pretty textbook. Illness settled over the past like a ruby filter. As I tried to reconcile what I’d known then, with what I understood now, I became a researcher, an excavator, collecting facts, each one an edge piece to the puzzle. I scoured the annals of literature, psychology, science, and religion. Plumbed the , mainstream psychology’s bible. I learned about schizophrenia from psychiatrists’ perspectives and from those who lived with it. I spent long dark days in a corner of the internet rife with sparkly, mispunctuated websites, which unraveled the complicated backstories of Catholic stigmatic’s, saints, and martyrs. Now, it was me who was reading to survive. Slowly, I was building a new lexicon and, from that lexicon, a new lens for understanding my childhood. could be dissociation. hallucination. trauma flashbacks. But one term really changed everything. The hallmark of a delusion is its imperviousness to debunking. No matter what facts or information are presented to the deluded person, what they believe, and experience, is the absolute truth. To disagree only agitates them and can render you irrelevant, or worse, cast you as an antagonist in their story. When delusions are clearly unreal—dreams of being married to a celebrity or seeing dragons, for example—they’re easier to distinguish. But my mother’s stories were harder to pinpoint because they were about real people and tracked with the culture and environment that we’d lived in—one where mystics and liberations aligned at the foot of a cosmic mountain. While my adult reality no longer aligned with my mother’s, as a child, what she had believed formed the bounds of my own imagination. Much of what she shared; I took at face value. Even if something smelled off, I didn’t disbelieve that it was true to her. While for me, spirituality was a novel possibility; for her it was the way she saw the world. Writer Esmé Weijun Wang, who has schizoaffective disorder, writes about how Western society has perceived the trajectory of the schizophrenic: The story of schizophrenia is one with a protagonist, “the schizophrenic,” who is first a fine and good vessel with fine and good things inside of it, and then becomes misshapen through the ravages of psychosis; the vessel becomes prone to being filled with nasty things. Finally, the wicked thoughts and behaviors that may ensue become inseparable from the person, who is now unrecognizable from what they once were. Toward the end of her life, my mother wrote me a letter: “My well-being is not your responsibility, sweet girl.” I broke down in tears when I read that line, because even though she’d never asked that of me—not, exactly—it felt like it was. Because I couldn’t save my mother, I could not fully see her. Even as a girl, some deep, survivalist part of me knew that if I stayed, I would have been consumed with helping; with fixing what was unfixable. What in fact did not need fixing but tending. Mental illness doesn’t always demand a solution. It’s not something to be “cured,” but accepted and supported and adapted to. The gap between her and I, the problem, was not her mind per se, but the schism between her reality and mine. Between her as mystic or mad. Between the life I saw as productive and the one allowed to her. I’ve had to forgive myself for what I chose not to see. For choosing myself. I’ll never know how many of her stories and struggles were real, and how many were imagined. But in her death, I was able to finally look at them, to turn them over in my hands and examine their many facets. Maybe all those years, in defining her visions via spiritual imagery and stories, she was reclaiming her vessel, rendering it “fine and good,” as per Wang. Maybe the stigma of schizophrenia as split mind has been so persistent because it’s easier to say goodbye to one part of a person you love than to accept that they could be, that they terror and beauty wrapped into one. And maybe this is my work. Our work. To allow it all to exist at once. __________________________________",

        "content": "On Tuesday, Deutsche Bank adjusted its outlook on Barry Callebaut AG (BARN:SW) (OTC: BYCBF) shares. The firm reduced the price target to CHF1,900 from CHF2,000, while still endorsing a Buy rating on the stock. This change reflects a more cautious stance on the company's growth prospects amid potential headwinds. Barry Callebaut's stock has shown resilience in the market, with a 6% increase year to date compared to a flat performance by European Staples. The stock has also recovered significantly, up 31% from its yearly lows. Currently, Barry Callebaut's shares are trading at 22 times forward 12-month consensus earnings and have a 1.35 times forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio relative to European Staples. Historically, the company's stock has traded approximately 20% higher when earnings per share forecasts and volume growth were aligned. However, Deutsche Bank anticipates challenges due to the impact of retail price increases on volume sales. In light of these considerations, the bank has revised its volume growth estimate for the year 2025 to a flat rate from the previous forecast of 1.7% growth. The revised price target suggests that Deutsche Bank sees limited potential for a re-rating of Barry Callebaut's shares until there is evidence of sustainable volume growth. The bank's analysis implies a cautious but still optimistic view of the company's future performance in the market. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Hyderabad: Praja Bhavan, the official residence of Deputy Chief Minister Bhatti Vikramarka and the place to register grievances by public, received a hoax bomb threat from a caller on Monday, Tv9 telugu reported. The suspect in the phone call to the police control room issued a warning saying that the bomb would explode soon. Alerted by the threat call, police and bomb squad teams immediately reached and are carried out inspections. Meanwhile, everyone working on the premises have been evacuated from the building. Police registered a case and is trying to trace the caller. It was later confirmed that it was the work of a hoax caller. The building was previously called Pragathi Bhavan and served as the official residence of ex-CM K Chandrasekhar Rao. After Congress came into power in December, they removed the barriers placed outside the residence and opened it to the public for Prajavani. The public can approach the government with their grievances and register their complaints at Praja Bhavan.",

        "description": "Critical consensus – if you can ever find it – indicates it was a good year, even if reviews were rarely rapturous.",
        "content": "Sex and politics (including, but not only, the dignity of exiled director Mohammad Rasoulof’s impassioned plea for those imprisoned in Iran) is a potent blend, and Cannes 77 really hit the pulse button on it over 12 headline-hogging days. For those searching for a trend, you could call the first part of the festival lively, youth-friendly, punchy, multiplex-adjacent: a jury prize-winning musical about a Mexican sex-change gangster from Jacques Audiard ( , with Netflix), a deranged feminist body-horror from Coralie Fargeat ( , best screenplay, with Mubi), and the pumpingly potent hooker/mob Palme d’Or-winning drama from Sean Baker ( , with Neon). By the time we got to the festival’s second act – directed by Paolo Sorrentino, (Karim Aïnouz) and the Donald Trump origins story (Ali Abassi) – it was becoming clear that Cannes hadn’t seen this many boobs and bums and agents provocateurs since starlets used to strip for the paparazzi on the public beach. Sex sells, and if you look at the line-up, there’s a sense that Cannes 2024 was also selling itself. Greta Gerwig’s jury , which will make her even more popular. (Baker underscored his win on stage by emphatically endorsing theatrical distribution.) Jesse Plemons took best actor for Searchlight’s opening soon. Elegant arthouse beauty from Miguel Gomes was awarded best director, while the elegiac Indian drama by Payal Kapadia won the runner-up Grand Jury prize, no mean feat for a debut and the first Indian film to compete in 30 years. With Rasoulof’s the second-to-last film to play – getting a special award, Gerwig also shared the pot. All anyone could talk about going into the festival was whether Cannes 77 could top Cannes 76, which saw and duelling it all the way from Croisette to the Oscars. But Cannes is always canny. There are many ways to have a better festival. Critical consensus – if you can ever find it – indicates it was a good year, even if reviews were rarely rapturous. There are other titles in Competition that will clearly attract more specialised audiences: Magnus von Horn’s challenging , Jia Zhangke’s . Andrea Arnold’s will appeal to audiences at home in the UK. Over 22 films, not every one can be a winner, and some weren’t even close. Where the festival stumbled most clearly was in its sentimental debt to the lions of the past: David Cronenberg’s , Paul Schrader’s and Francis Ford Coppola’s grand folly , in particular. Sorrentino may only be 53 but ’s male gaze had the sweaty sheen of a dirty old man. It was also a very poor year for French cinema: Christophe Honore’s was a misfire, while Michel Hazanavicius’s Holocaust animation was bizarrely misjudged and Gilles Lellouche’s epic was a flat-lining flop. Three French films languishing at the bottom of is a poor showing indeed: if it wasn’t for Fargeat with shooting in English, and Agathe Reidinger with the underrated , it would have been a domestic wipeout. Hindsight is 20/20 of course. Last year’s attendees could clearly see the artistic value of and , but nobody could have predicted the commercial successes of a 150-minute French courtroom drama and a challenging, cerebral Holocaust film. So unpredictable things may yet happen. Kirill Serebrennikov’s taxing may strike a chord – Ben Whisaw’s performance is worth a view – although it seems unlikely. And Abbasi’s Trump drama could continue to draw attention if the US presidential hopeful . Outside of Competition, it was a year of consolidation. Un Certain Regard (UCR) solidified its reputation as the place to find new work, after years of confusion. Premiere, introduced as a section for directors who don’t want to compete, didn’t really lure enough of them – it was a shame to see Jessica Palud’s quietly confident , about Maria Schneider, sitting there awkwardly. Out of Competition was the usual pick-and-mix of films about to open in France, studio blast-outs and curios that may or may not hit the seam but don’t really fit in other sections. Down the Croisette, Critics’ Week knows exactly what it is doing and continues to do it. Directors’ Fortnight is probably the most challenging section in Cannes right now, with a confused sense of identity in the wake of UCR’s newfound strength. People were generally happy, apart from Kelly Rowland. There were no demonstrations that significantly disrupted the event. The politics stayed attached to the films. The ticketing process even worked – and that’s a first in 77 years. From Iran to Trump to body horror and trans Mexican musicals, the festival was never out of the news cycle for its entire 12 days – and it never lost control of that news cycle either. Cannes is a bizarre symbiosis of art and business and fashion and in the last few years a honeypot for global influencers and celebrity dogs. The festival keeps on getting bigger, dwarfing the town. It makes no sense. But somehow it still worked. Canny old Cannes indeed.",

Using commercial furniture in your home can improve the look of your room and make it more useful and durable. Whether you’re looking to create a sleek home office or a cozy dining area, choosing the right pieces can make all the difference. In this article, you will explore five must-have commercial furniture items that can enhance both the aesthetics and functionality of your home. 1. Office Chairs Office chairs are essential commercial furniture pieces for home offices or workspaces. They provide comfort and support during long hours of sitting and working. Look for ergonomic office chairs with adjustable features such as height, armrests, and lumbar support to promote good posture and reduce strain on the body. Choose chairs made from durable materials for longevity and invest in quality for comfort and productivity. 2. Commercial-Grade Sofas and Seating Commercial-grade sofas and seating offer durability and style for home use. These pieces are designed to withstand heavy use and provide comfort for guests or family members. When shopping for sofas, make sure they have strong frames, good upholstery, and cushions that support you. You might want to think about sectional sofas or modular seating arrangements that can be used in a variety of settings. 3. Desks and Workstations Desks and workstations are essential for creating productive and organized home office environments. Choose desks with ample workspace, storage drawers, and cable management features to keep your workspace clutter-free and functional. For better posture and more freedom in your work schedule, think about getting an adjustable standing desk. If you want something to last a long time, look for materials that are strong, like metal or wood. 4. Storage Solutions Storage solutions are crucial for keeping your home organized and clutter-free. Invest in commercial-grade storage cabinets, shelving units, and filing systems to maximize space and efficiency. While still giving you enough space to store your things, look for storage solutions that blend in with your current furniture and decor. For more options, look for pieces that can be used for more than one thing, like ottomans or coffee tables with hidden storage spaces. 5. Accent Pieces and Accessories Accent pieces and accessories add personality and style to your home while complementing your commercial furniture. To improve the mood of your space, add decorative touches like art, rugs, throw pillows, and light fixtures. For added convenience and style in your home office or living room, add useful accessories such as desk organizers, task lamps, and decorative storage baskets. Make sure the pieces you choose match your style and help make your home feel cohesive and welcoming. Get the Best Commercial Furniture for Your Home Now Whether you’re furnishing a home office, dining area, or outdoor space, choosing commercial-grade furniture ensures long-lasting quality and aesthetic appeal.

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR, May 28 — Two Malaysian startups, Foqcus Sdn Bhd and Qarbotech Sdn Bhd, who represented Malaysia’s delegation at the Annual Investment Meeting (AIM) Congress 2024 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), have clinched the second and third positions in the AIM Startup Pitch Competition, signalling global interest in their innovative vision and groundbreaking technologies. Focqus pitched its innovation for the Pre-Seed Stage while Qarbotech competed for the Seed Stage among other startups from key international markets including the US, Russia, China, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Uganda, India, and the UAE. Foqcus, a recipient of Cradle’s CIP Sprint grant programme, clinched second place and received USD10,000 for its future ventures. The startup specialises in product digital identification, traceability, and data intelligence through QR code, known as SmartKood. SmartKood provides highly integrable and customisable solutions spanning various sectors, including big data analytics and consumer engagement activities. For the Seed stage category, Qarbotech, a Malaysia Venture Capital Management Berhad’s (MAVCAP) investee company, secured third place with USD5,000 at the competition after being selected by MAVCAP to participate in Malaysia’s delegation. Qarbotech specialises in developing biocompatible solutions designed to enhance the photosynthesis rate of leafy plants, accelerating crop cycles and fostering plant growth. Led by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation (Mosti), alongside agencies under its purview including Cradle Fund Sdn Bhd (Cradle), Malaysian Research Accelerator for Technology & Innovation (MRANTI), Malaysian Industry-Government Group for High Technology (MIGHT), and MAVCAP, Malaysia’s delegation comprised nine (9) startups from diverse sectors. The startups are Aerodyne Ventures Sdn Bhd (DT3 - drone, data technology, and digital transformation), Umrahme (travel tech), Braintree Technologies Sdn Bhd (AI and robotics), Gobuilders Netsoft Sdn Bhd or GOLOG (logistics), MoneyMatch Sdn Bhd (FinTech), Sonicboom Sdn Bhd (FinTech), DF Automation & Robotics Automotive Sdn Bhd (IoT and robotics), Focqus (DataTech), and Qarbotech (AgTech). Norman Matthieu Vanhaecke, Group CEO of Cradle, expressed immense pride in Foqcus and Qarbotech, emphasising the boundless potential of Malaysian innovation and entrepreneurship: “We are proud of Foqcus and Qarbotech for their outstanding achievements at the AIM Congress 2024 as their triumphs reflect exceptional innovation, dedication, and Malaysia’s vibrant startup ecosystem on the global stage. With the right support and opportunities, we have no doubt that they will continue to push boundaries and shape the future of industries worldwide.” “I am honoured to stand alongside fellow entrepreneurs, who represent Malaysia globally. This victory serves as evidence not only of the exceptional talent and innovation within our country but also of the constant support we have received from the government. It is clear that this is precisely the vision our government had in mind - to showcase Malaysia’s local talent and homegrown innovation, making our nation proud on the world stage,” said Bryant Kooh, Founder of Foqcus. “Qarbotech is a testament to Malaysia’s innovative spirit and entrepreneurial culture as we focus on empowering smallholder farmers through our technological solutions. Participating in the AIM Startup Pitch Competition with other Malaysian startups is a significant milestone for us as it was an opportunity to showcase our locally developed technology to a global audience. We believe that our technology has the potential to make a meaningful impact globally, and we are excited to share it with the world,” said Chor Chee Hoe, CEO of Qarbotech. In addition to the pitching competitions, two startups funded by Cradle, MoneyMatch and GOLOG, formed collaborations with UAE-based companies as part of their business missions to AIM Congress 2024. MoneyMatch, one of Cradle’s CIP300 recipients and Cradle Seed Ventures’ Investee, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Trade Foresight to explore the integration of cross-border payment solutions through a pilot test, engaging Trade Foresight’s clientele to facilitate transactions with anticipated monthly transaction volumes ranging from RM10 million to RM15 million. Meanwhile, GOLOG, which is also one of Cradle’s CIP300 recipients, signed an MoU with Royal Eficaz General Trading LLC of the UAE to attract and secure substantial investments with a target of USD150 million. Mosti’s delegation, led by YBhg. Datuk Ts. Dr. Mohd Nor Azman Hassan, Deputy Secretary-General (Technology Development) of Mosti, also featured YBrs. Ts. Dr. Raslan Ahmad, Senior Vice President of MIGHT, who presented a session titled “Designing the Future of Cities: Innovation, Sustainability, and Community Engagement”, where he shared insights on urban planning challenges as well as the pivotal role of MIGHT and the Malaysia Smart Cities Alliance (MSCA) in advancing the field of smart cities.

        "content": "Most Manchester United fans favour the club keeping Erik ten Hag as manager, according to a new poll, as the Dutchman awaits his fate amid talks over his future. Ten Hag’s position appears to still be uncertain despite leading the Old Trafford club to FA Cup triumph at Wembley on Saturday to secure a Europa League spot next season. The former Ajax boss had endured a difficult campaign in the Premier League, though, guiding Manchester United to an eighth-placed finish. Speculation that the club may move on from Ten Hag intensified ahead of the cup final after a report claimed that he would be sacked regardless of the result. But polling from the Manchester Evening News suggests that he retains the support of the club’s fans, with 78 per cent of 10,000 respondents indicating that they would like him to stay. Only 39 per cent had wanted Ten Hag to remain in charge into the final year of a three-year contract when asked after the 4-0 defeat to Crystal Palace earlier this month. Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and co-chairman Joel Glazer are leading a review of the club’s season with assistance from Sir Dave Brailsford, director of sport at Ineos , and Jason Wilcox, recently installed as technical director. Representatives of United have already spoken to the camps of Mauricio Pochettino , Thomas Tuchel , Kieran McKenna and Thomas Frank to prepare for the event that Ten Hag is sacked.",

        "description": "Canadian immigration authorities received 2,000 work permit applications in first four months of this year, down from over 4,200 logged for same period in 2023.",
        "content": "The number of Hongkongers applying for work permits under a bespoke Canadian migration pathway over a four-month period has dropped more than 50 per cent from a year ago, with an expert partly attributing the fall to the country’s gloomy job market. Canadian immigration figures from Tuesday also showed that 60 per cent of those applying for permanent residency (PR) under the pathway’s work and study routes were still waiting on approval as of April. The country rolled out the policy in 2021 in the wake of the Beijing-imposed national security law, with those holding an open work permit able to qualify for PR status if they work full-time for at least a year or chalk up 1,560 hours of employment. The documents allow graduates to apply without first securing a job, while their spouses and dependents can also move to Canada. The data showed immigration authorities received about 2,000 applications for work permits in the first four months of this year, down from the more than 4,200 logged over the same period in 2023. Authorities have received a total of 45,146 such applications as of April this year. Willis Fu Yiu-wai, a senior immigration consultant at Goldmax Associates, partly attributed the drop in work permit applications to Canada’s gloomy job market. “Recently, a job fair in Canada attracted lots of people to line up, with people having to wait for a ticket to enter,” he said. “Some of those with tickets could not even get in before the end of the fair.” Tuesday’s figures from the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada that showed 60 per cent of the total 18,983 applications for PR status from Hongkongers on work and study routes, or 13,387, had become stuck in the bureaucratic pipeline as of April. Some of the country’s politicians had expressed concerns that earlier the prolonged processing period for PR applications had left Hongkongers facing looming uncertainties about their work and study statuses expiring. Such concerns prompted Canada to launch a three-year special work permit on Monday that allows Hongkongers waiting on a decision for their PR cases to extend their temporary status in the country. Fu of Goldmax Associates said he believed those determined to secure PR status under the pathway had already applied, given finding a job in the country, application processing and relocating to the country could take a “very long time”. He also expected the number of PR pathway applicants would continue to decline ahead of the policy’s deadline on August 2026. “Many who decided to leave the city might have left already,” he said. “It is also not easy to find a job in Canada and they need to reserve ample time to fulfil the work requirement.”",

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, businesses face a significant challenge: the IT skills gap. This gap refers to the disparity between the demand for skilled IT professionals and the supply of qualified talent available in the job market. It’s a pressing issue that affects organisations of all sizes and industries. So, how can businesses overcome this hurdle and ensure they have the expertise needed to thrive in the digital age? The answer lies in outsourcing IT support services. The Challenges of Hiring In-House IT Talent Hiring and retaining qualified IT professionals can be a daunting task for businesses. The competition for top talent is fierce, and recruiting efforts often fall short due to the specialised nature of IT roles. Moreover, once hired, IT staff turnover rates can be high, leading to disruptions in operations and increased recruitment costs. Additionally, the investment required to train and upskill in-house IT teams can be substantial, further straining budgets and resources. How Outsourcing Addresses the Skills Gap Outsourcing IT support services offers a solution to the challenges posed by the skills gap. By partnering with a reputable IT service provider, businesses gain access to a pool of specialised expertise tailored to their specific needs. You can view the top 3 IT consulting firms here. Whether it’s cybersecurity, cloud computing, or software development, outsourcing allows organisations to tap into a vast network of skilled professionals without the overhead costs associated with in-house hiring. Best Practices for Outsourcing IT Support When considering outsourcing IT support, it’s essential to follow best practices to ensure a successful partnership. Start by thoroughly researching potential service providers to find one that aligns with your business objectives and values. Once you’ve chosen a partner, establish clear communication channels and expectations to facilitate collaboration and transparency. Regularly monitor performance metrics and maintain accountability to ensure the outsourced services meet your needs and standards. Addressing Concerns and Risks While outsourcing IT support offers numerous benefits, it’s natural for businesses to have concerns about security, confidentiality, and reliability. However, these concerns can be mitigated by implementing robust security measures, such as encryption protocols and access controls, and by carefully vetting potential service providers to ensure they adhere to industry standards and regulations. Additionally, developing contingency plans for potential disruptions in outsourced services can help minimise risks and ensure business continuity. Elements You Want from a Managed IT Service Provider Are you trying to choose a managed IT service provider? This is a huge step for your business and one that can be very valuable. Of course, the idea behind choosing a provider is that you can access expertise in a cost-effective way. Indeed, you get to enhance your setup in a way that supports your team. If they run into IT issues, experts are on hand to help. So, how do you choose between different managed IT service providers? Some elements that signify quality should be considered. Let’s take a look at what they are. 24/7 Help You never know when you’re going to run into a technology issue. But, what you do know is that it can cause havoc for your team. So, you need to ensure that the managed IT service provider will give you the support you require when you need it. Make sure you get 24/7 help from the team. Then, you know that no matter when the issue arises, it will get dealt with immediately. Affordable Prices One of the reasons why you’re looking for a managed IT service provider is that you want to run your business efficiently. You recognise the power of outsourcing and want to use it to your advantage. Well, this means that you need to find a provider that’s willing to give you an affordable price. There are some providers out there that are changing a fortune for simple services. You need to sniff out the affordable ones that don’t compromise the service they give you. Use a discovery call to discover whether they have cost-effective prices. Around-the-clock Help IT issues can happen at any time.

Login or signup to continue reading As Illawarra Hotel publican Ryan Aitchison climbs the stairs from the ground to the first and second floor of the Illawarra Hotel, the dusty layers of the historic building feel unavoidably present. Not that Mr Aitchison and partner and co-publican Nikki Aitchison are the planning on donning the khaki jumpsuit of Ghostbusters anytime soon, but they are planning an exorcism - of sorts - of the pub they have run since 2022. The pair and their backers have submitted a major development application to renovate the upper floors of the hotel, opening a new cocktail lounge and high end fine dining restaurant in the former accommodation suites. The efforts are part of Mr Aitchison's push to turn the Wollongong CBD into a nightlife hub for the region and a destination for visitors, with the Illawarra Hotel at its beating heart. \"What we deliver will be a destination for people from West Wollongong and Bellambi, but a place for people to travel to because it is a precinct that will outshine anywhere from the Shire all the way down to the Shoalhaven,\" Mr Aitchison said. Pending DA approval, the plan will be start to works in earnest in early 2025, with the plan to open the upper floors by spring. By then, visitors to the pub will arrive to the ground floor that will be largely the same as it is now for drinks and casual dining through the day. Upstairs, patrons will be greeted at the top of the stairs on the first floor, and have the choice to either head into the double height lounge to their left, or turn to the fine dining restaurant on their right. The kitchen that will service these spaces and the downstairs bistro will move upstairs, from one of the smallest pub kitchens in the Illawarra to one of the largest, with a yet to be revealed head chef behind the pass. A sommelier will have the benefit of an oversized, temperature-controlled wine room, for local drops as well as something a bit more special. As the evening progresses, the ground floor will continue to serve Wollongong's student and younger crowd, with DJs and live music potentially until late, while the acoustically separated upper areas will turn into a supper club with late night dining available past midnight upstairs. \"We really want to create different atmospheres and different areas for different people,\" Mr Aitchison said. \"What we don't want to do is shut down up here and push everyone downstairs to one common area, we want to keep people in the area they want to be in and then let them leave organically when they choose to.\" To achieve this vision the couple - self described pub nerds - have been on a tour of venues of sorts, but are yet to find one that blends sophisticated dining in one space with a thumping nightclub in another, with the closest being the ritzy yet student favourite the Golden Sheaf in Sydney's eastern suburbs. The call to remove the accommodation aspect was a tough one, but one necessitated by the modern standards required by guests and regulators. \"If there was a way to get accommodation here we would have done it, because that is the first and foremost critical need of Wollongong,\" Mr Aitchison said. \"But to try and make that work, due to the structure and the heritage we would have had to retrofit and skin the inside of the entire building and it would have cost twice as much as building a hotel anywhere else.\" But, Mr Aitchison is well aware that the plans he and his partner have do not exist in isolation. He bemoans the lack of any northbound train from Wollongong station after midnight until the pre-dawn services begin and the plan to transform the pub is as much of an ambit claim to show what's possible, if governments and other bodies step up to the plate. \"The key for us with this renovation and working with [24 Hour Economy Commissioner Michael Rodrigues] and other agencies is making sure that when this opens, it'll open in a city that has hopefully done some reshaping, reforming.\" As that work happens between governments, the Aitchisons will start cleaning out the former managers' quarters and staff rooms upstairs. Along the way they have no doubt there will be skeletons uncovered - some former Halloween decorations, others ... perhaps not.",

The ‘Baby Boks’ are in Pool C with England, Argentina and Fiji; Pool A consists of France, Wales, New Zealand and Spain; and Ireland, runners up in 2023, Australia, Georgia and Italy are in Pool B. Bafana Nhleko’s sides fixtures are as follows: Saturday 29 June v Fiji at 7pm at Cape Town Stadium Thursday 4 July v Argentina at 7pm at Danie Craven Stadium, Stellenbosch Tuesday 9 July v England at 7pm at Athlone Stadium, Cape Town Twelve of the best U20 teams in the world will take part at the “World Cup” for juniors between 29 June and 19 July in and around Cape Town. The Junior Boks won the bronze medal at the 2023 tournament, with France the winners. SA Rugby CEO Rian Oberholzer said: “Last year’s tournament was an unforgettable experience and we’re expecting more of the same this year. With the recent U20 Rugby Championship, we saw how closely matched the four Sanzaar teams were, and it was the same in the U20 Six Nations, where England emerged victorious. “To host the next generation of superstars next month is a great privilege and we can’t wait to welcome their families, friends and fans to South Africa. “The World Rugby U20 Championship plays an important role in the global rugby picture and is key in promoting and growing the game, while we are also excited to unearth the next generation of Springboks.” The World Rugby U20 Championship 2024 will be the first international competition to feature the three new law amendments implemented to promote ball in flow and diversity of attacking options, while supporting player welfare. These are that players will no longer be put onside when an opponent catches the ball from a kick in open play and runs five metres, players must make an attempt to retreat; scrums will no longer be an option from free kicks; and the banning of the crocodile roll. A package of six law trials will also operate, including the simplified red card sanction process, approved by the World Rugby Executive Board.

        "content": "Innovative material for sustainable buildings. Maximizing natural light in buildings is a popular trend due to its potential to save on energy costs. However, traditional glass roofs and walls often lead to issues such as glare, lack of privacy, and overheating. While alternative solutions like coatings and light-diffusing materials have been explored, they haven’t fully addressed these problems. Now, researchers at the Institute for Microstructure Technology (IMT) and the Light Technology Institute (LTI) at KIT have developed a novel polymer-based metamaterial that is not only more transparent to light but adds privacy, cools the room inside, and automatically cleans itself. It could potentially have significant implications for the future of building design and energy efficiency. This Polymer-based Micro-Photonic Multi-Functional Metamaterial (PMMM) consists of microscopic pyramids made of silicone, each measuring approximately ten micrometers, which is about one-tenth the diameter of a hair. This unique design provides the PMMM film with multiple functions, including light diffusion, self-cleaning, and radiative cooling, all while maintaining a high level of transparency. “A key feature is the ability to efficiently radiate heat through the Earth’s atmosphere’s long-wave infrared transmission window, releasing heat into the cold expanse of the universe. This allows for passive radiative cooling without electricity consumption,” explains Bryce S. Richards, Professor at IMT and LTI. In the lab and in experiments conducted under real outdoor conditions, the researchers rigorously tested the material’s properties. They measured its light transmittance, light scattering, reflection properties, self-cleaning ability , and cooling performance using modern spectrophotometry. The results were quite impressive. The tests showed that the material achieved a cooling effect of 6 °C compared to the ambient temperature. Additionally, the material exhibited a high spectral transmittance of 95%, compared to the usual 91% of most glass. At the same time, the micro-pyramid structure scattered 73% of the incoming sunlight, resulting in a diffused appearance and creating a more comfortable and private indoor environment. “When the material is used in roofs and walls, it allows for bright yet glare-free and privacy-protected indoor spaces for work and living. In greenhouses, the high light transmittance could increase yields because the photosynthesis efficiency is estimated to be nine percent higher than in greenhouses with glass roofs,” says RichardsGan Huang, a Group Leader at IMT. The PMMM film’s micro-pyramids provide superhydrophobic properties, akin to a lotus leaf, causing water to form droplets that effortlessly remove dirt and dust. This self-cleaning feature ensures easy maintenance and durability of the material . “Our newly developed material has the potential to be used in various areas and makes a significant contribution to sustainable and energy-efficient architecture,” explains Richards. “The material can simultaneously optimize the use of sunlight indoors, provide passive cooling, and reduce reliance on air conditioning. The solution is scalable and can be seamlessly integrated into plans for environmentally friendly building construction and urban development,” says Huang. Journal reference:",

The NBA also held a moment of silence to honour Walton’s life before Game 4 of the Boston Celtics-Indiana Pacers matchup in the Eastern Conference finals on Monday night. Walton entered the Hall of Fame in 1993 asnone of the game’s most celebrated figures. His Basketball career was disrupted by several chronic foot injuries. Walton found post-career success as a basketball commentator, becoming well-known for his “infectious enthusiasm and love for the game,” according to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. Silver remembered Walton as a rare breed who redefined the center position, adding that he delivered insightful and colorful commentary that entertained generations of basketball fans.",

        "content": "Guwahati: Torrrential rain brought by cyclone Remal caused a collapse in a stone quarry in India's remote northeastern state of Mizoram, killing at least 10 people, while harsh weather hampers efforts to rescue those trapped, authorities said on Tuesday. Weather authorities said the powerful cyclone had weakened into a depression after devastating regional coastlines the previous day, killing at least 16 and cutting power to millions in parts of eastern India and neighbouring Bangladesh. Bitter weather was holding up rescue efforts in Melthum, the site of the quarry outside the state capital of Aizawl, a state disaster management official said. \"There have been incessant rains in the wake of cyclone Remal, which led to the quarry collapse,\" the official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. There were no immediate details of the number trapped. The heavy rain in Mizoram, which borders Bangladesh, also unleashed landslides in the region. Authorities in India's eastern state of West Bengal were working to restore electricity lines in the worst-affected areas, after Remal stripped power lines and uprooted trees. It is the first of the frequent storms expected to pound the low-lying coasts of the South Asian neighbours this year as climate change drives up surface temperatures at sea.",

        "content": "BRUSSELS (AP) — Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne will lead a rejuvenated Belgium side including a once-retired Alex Witsel at the European Championship next month. De Bruyne and Witsel were on the 25-man list unveiled by coach Domenico Tedesco on Tuesday. Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, preparing for the Champions League final, was not. Full back Maxim De Cuyper, who won the Belgian league with Club Brugge last weekend, was the only newcomer. De Bruyne and Witsel are remaining members of the so-called golden generation of Belgian players. While De Bruyne’s presence was expected, Witsel’s was a surprise after Tedesco dropped him from his first squad last year. Witsel soon after announced his and did not play in qualifying. But Tedesco said Witsel’s recent showings with Atletico Madrid convinced him the 35-year-old midfielder was the right choice. “I have the best feelings with Axel,” Tedesco said. Tedesco said Courtois was not ready for Euro 2024, which starts on June 14 in Germany, after recently returning from injury. The men are at odds last year, and Courtois announced in December he would miss the Euros. Tedesco succeeded Roberto Martinez as Belgium manager in February 2023. He has yet to lose a game in charge of the Red Devils. Belgium will face Slovakia, Romania and Ukraine in Group E. Belgium’s best result at the continental tournament was runner-up in 1980. ___ Belgium: Goalkeepers: Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest), Koen Casteels (Wolfsburg), Thomas Kaminski (Luton). Defenders: Wout Faes (Leicester), Timothy Castagne (Fulham), Arthur Theate (Rennes), Jan Vertonghen (Anderlecht), Axel Witsel (Atletico Madrid), Zeno Debast (Anderlecht), Thomas Meunier (Trabzonspor), Maxim De Cuyper (Club Brugge) Midfielders: Aster Vranckx (Wolfsburg), Youri Tielemans (Aston Villa), Orel Mangala (Lyon), Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City), Arthur Vermeeren (Atletico Madrid), Amadou Onana (Everton) Forwards: Romelu Lukaku (Roma), Charles De Ketelaere (Atalanta), Jérémy Doku (Manchester City), Lois Openda (Leipzig), Leandro Trossard (Arsenal), Johan Bakayoko (PSV Eindhoven), Dodi Lukebakio (Sevilla), Yannick Carrasco (Al-Shabab) ___ AP soccer:",

        "description": "From rocking out with Bananarama to her friendship with Cillia Black and Cliff Richard, Gloria has had a glistening career",
        "content": "Veteran broadcaster Gloria Hunniford's career has spanned over six decades. Born on April 10, 1940, in Portadown, Gloria has become one of the most beloved figures in British television and radio. Her life has been full of professional triumphs, personal challenges, and unwavering resilience. Christened Mary Winifred Gloria Hunniford, she began her career singing, performing as a vocalist in local clubs and theatres. However, it was her transition to broadcasting that would define her professional journey. Gloria’s broadcasting career began in the 1960s with the BBC Northern Ireland, where she presented various radio programmes. Her warm voice and engaging personality quickly won her listeners’ hearts, paving the way for her transition to television. In the 1970s, Gloria moved to London, where she joined the BBC’s national radio network and became a prominent figure on Radio 2. Gloria's television career blossomed in the 1980s and 1990s. She became a familiar face on BBC’s Holiday, where her travel reports captivated viewers. Her versatility as a presenter was evident as she seamlessly moved from travel shows to more serious programming, including Sunday, Sunday and Weighing In. In 1998, Gloria joined Channel 5 to host “Open House with Gloria Hunniford,” a daily talk show that featured celebrity interviews, lifestyle segments, and audience participation. The show was a hit, further cementing her status as a television icon. Despite her professional success, Gloria has faced significant personal challenges. In 2004, she experienced a profound loss when her daughter, Caron Keating, a popular television presenter, died of breast cancer at the age of 41. This tragedy profoundly impacted Gloria, who channelled her grief into advocacy and charity work. In memory of her daughter, Gloria established the Caron Keating Foundation, which supports cancer charities and patients. Her efforts have raised substantial funds and awareness, reflecting her enduring commitment to fighting the disease that took her daughter. In 2017, she was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for her services to cancer charities through the Caron Keating Foundation. Last weekend Gloria became the first female awarded Freedom of The Borough of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon at a glitzy ceremony in Armagh.",

        "content": "Is Becky Lynch Wrapping up Her WWE Career? By , one of the greatest women’s wrestlers in WWE, appears to be wrapping up her career with the company on RAW. Lynch has been the face of the women’s division for more than half a decade. And now she faces major developments regarding her future in WWE. A few months ago, reports indicated that Becky Lynch’s contract with WWE would expire in June. However, prior to the latest edition of WWE RAW, emerged that Lynch and WWE had still not reached terms on a new contract. Both sides have been in contact, but as of now, nothing has been signed. On the latest edition of WWE RAW, Becky Lynch competed in a Women’s World Championship match. Lynch challenged Liv Morgan in a steel cage match for the title Morgan had won from her just two days prior at King and Queen of the Ring. However, reports have surfaced regarding an intriguing situation surrounding the match, which will potentially impact Becky Lynch’s future with WWE. According to , Becky Lynch’s Women’s World title match wasn’t the only element of concern. Lynch’s contract, set to expire in four days on June 1, means that if they don’t reach an agreement by then, Lynch will become a free agent. On WWE RAW, Becky Lynch lost her match against . With her loss of the title and the lack of contract renewal with WWE, it will be interesting to see what unfolds next in the situation. However, it’s also important to note that she was originally set to take a break following WrestleMania 40 due to Rhea Ripley’s injury, but Lynch returned to the screens nonetheless. Tonight is Becky Lynch’s final match on her current WWE contract. Her contract expires this Saturday June 1st. ( ) Becky Lynch teases retirement on WWE RAW During her WWE contract situation, Becky Lynch hinted at retiring on RAW. In a backstage segment with Lyra Valkyria, Becky Lynch was giving her a pep talk. Lynch mentioned that it is not always about winning; rather, it is about continually improving. Lynch then stated that one should keep winning and learning until it’s time to walk away. Becky Lynch to Lyra Valkyria: \"So Saturday didn't go our way, but it's not about winning all the time. It's about getting better every time. So we'll either win or we'll learn, we'll keep winning or keep learning. Until it's time to walk away. You got this. Consider kneepads.\"... This intriguing statement from Lynch raises the question of whether she is contemplating retirement plans or simply playing with the fans regarding her contract situation. As a devoted professional wrestling fan and writer, the sport is a vital source of joy and escape for me. Wrestling has been a consistent pillar of stability and comfort, shaping the person I am today. Growing up, it played a significant role in my life, with John Cena being a superhero figure for me.

        "description": "It is Glasgow’s only remaining castle, and as one of Scotland’s oldest buildings has a fascinating history taking in romantic royal liaisons, warring dynasties and a place in the national defence during World War II.",
        "content": "Crookston Castle may now be overshadowed by the more famous fortress in Edinburgh, but in its day it was a major draw for thousands of tourists. And as Glasgow gears up to celebrate the 850th anniversary of the city’s founding next year, friends of Crookston Castle are calling for it to be given a central role. Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with an ad-lite subscription to GlasgowWorld, you get 70% fewer ads while viewing the news that matters to you. The hidden gem dates back to the 12th century and is the second oldest building in the city. A 12-month programme of events to mark the occasion will be created and David McDonald, former depute leader of Glasgow City Council and interim chairperson for the Friends of Crookston Castle is hopeful the castle will feature in the programme. Speaking exclusively to the local democracy reporting service (LDRS), he said: “We would like to be involved in the council’s 850th celebration of Glasgow as a city. “This is the perfect place to launch the celebrations and it would bring more people to the castle.” Advertisement Advertisement On a recent tour, on a suitably atmospheric, misty day, the group were happy to share just some of its fascinating history. In the 1160’s Robert Croc, a vassal of Walter the High Steward was granted an estate namely Croc’s toun. And in 1180, the then Sir Robert Croc was granted permission from Paisley Abbey to build a private chapel “as a special friend of the house”. In 1330, the lands were sold to Sir Alan Stewart, cousin to the first Stewart monarch Robert II and the Tower House we recognise today was built. Under the ownership of the Stewarts, who have been described as one of the most enduring and turbulent royal dynasties in Scottish history, the earlier castle was replaced by the present stone castle in around 1400. Advertisement Advertisement In 1361 the castle passed to John Stewart of Darnley, a cousin of King James I. He served as the Constable of the Scottish Army in France, supporting Joan of Arc during the Hundred Years War. He died on the battlefield in1429 and is buried at the Cathedral in Orléans In 1572, Crookston was passed to Darnley’s younger brother, Charles, the Earl of Lennox. Charles was regent for his young nephew, King James VI and maintained Crookston’s royal connections. The Stewart’s ownership of the castle came to an end in 1703 when Charles 1st Duke of Lennox sold it to the Duke of Montrose.Crookston was sold again in 1757 by the 2nd Duke of Montrose to the Maxwells of Pollok. Advertisement Advertisement John, the latest Baronet of Pollok was the first of the Maxwells to own the castle and is also credited with the building of nearby Pollok House. But Crookston then suffered from many years of neglect. In 1817 Sir Walter Scott published his novel The Abbot. His story cemented the idea of Mary Queen of Scots and Lord Henry Darnley’s courtship at the castle in the 16th century and increased its fame as an iconic and romantic location. Legend has it that Mary had a romantic rendezvous with her future husband beneath the shade of the yew tree. In 1847, under the ownership of the 8th Baronet, Crookston underwent refurbishment to mark the royal visit by Queen Victoria to Glasgow. Advertisement Advertisement During this time the legendary Crookston yew tree, which had been stripped bare by relic hunters seeking a souvenir, was felled. In the early 1900’s the Stirling Maxwell family opened the castle to day-trippers for the first time with 6500 paying visitors recorded in 1910. But at the outbreak of WWII the castle was on a war footing for the first time in hundreds of years. The tower was used by the Home Guard as an aircraft observation post during the blitz and an army camp was set up in the woodlands nearby. After the war saw the resumption of building across the community, with new homes and schools being built through the 1950’s and 60’s including the new Crookston Castle Secondary School, now the site of Crookston Castle Primary School. Advertisement Advertisement Today the castle stands as a highly visible reminder of the past and the friends of group are focused on the future and working to celebrate the only mediaeval castle in Glasgow. Speaking about the importance of the castle and its history Mr McDonald added: “I think the phrase hidden gem is used quite a lot but this is off the tourist track as well as for the residents. “We want to encourage people to come to the castle to learn more about its history. We want families from across the city including those struggling with the cost of living crisis to come and visit as this is a free day out. “There is easy access to the castle which is not too far from other places like Pollok Park which means there is enough in the area for families to make a day of it.” Advertisement Advertisement Brian Gerrand, from Crookston, added: “This project shows just how important these areas are, especially when a couple of years ago we weren’t allowed to leave our homes because of Covid 19. “Crookston Castle has a complex history and it is good to get people engaged with it.” To join the friends of group or for more information email [email protected]",

        "description": "En su escrito de defensa, incide en el que beso fue consentido y recuerda que la deportista, poco después, quita hierro al asunto en una entrevista.",
        "content": "El expresidente de la Real Federación Española de Fútbol (RFEF), Luis Rubiales , ha solicitado que sus dos hijas declaren como testigos en el juicio sobre el beso en la boca que dio a la futbolista Jenni Hermoso . Los hechos ocurrieron el pasado 20 de agosto, durante la entrega de medallas de la final del Mundial femenino, disputada en Sídney (Australia). La Fiscalía de la Audiencia Nacional, que presentó la querella que desencadenó este procedimiento judicial, acusa al granadino de los delitos de agresión sexual y de coacciones y pide para él una de pena total de dos años y medio de prisión . Rubiales será juzgado próximamente por este suceso. Y EL ESPAÑOL ha tenido acceso a su escrito de defensa, en el que incide en el que el beso no tuvo un carácter sexual ni un ánimo \"libidinoso\" . \"Las señoras [nombres omitidos] son las hijas de Luis Rubiales. Estuvieron ambas en la final del Mundial Femenino de Fútbol en Sídney y viajaron de vuelta en el avión a España junto a las jugadoras, sus familiares y amigos y los miembros de la RFEF, pudiendo aportar elementos valorativos al Juzgado de lo Penal [que juzgará a Rubiales] sobre los hechos de autos (...) y lo que ocurrió en el vuelo de vuelta a España\", expone dicho documento. Luis Rubiales narra en su escrito de defensa que durante la entrega de medallas conversó brevemente con Hermoso y la felicitó por el triunfo. \"Ambos abrieron los brazos, abrazándose afectuosamente, diciéndole la señora Hermoso al señor Rubiales: 'La que hemos liado', a lo que contestó el señor Rubiales: 'Este Mundial lo hemos ganado gracias a ti'\", explica su abogada, Olga Tubau. [La Fiscalía pide dos años y medio de cárcel para Rubiales por besar a Jenni Hermoso y coaccionarla] A renglón seguido, el escrito de defensa destaca que Rubiales quiso \"manifestar con esas palabras [a Hermoso] que era una jugadora de gran valía\", ya que días atrás había fallado un penalti, lo que le afectó en el ánimo. Recuerda también que la deportista coge con los brazos al por entonces máximo responsable de la RFEF y \"le alza del suelo\". \"Cuando este volvió a tener los pies sobre la tarima, mientras seguían abrazados él y Jennifer Hermoso se dieron mutuamente un beso en las mejillas, y cuando separaron sus cabezas, el señor Rubiales puso sus manos sobre las mejillas de Hermoso y le preguntó: '¿Te puedo dar un besito?' , contestando la señora Hermoso: 'Vale'\", relata el escrito de defensa, de 13 páginas. El relato de la defensa de Rubiales incide también en que, tras el beso, la jugadora, \"lejos de realizar algún gesto que revelara rechazo, incomodidad o contrariedad\", dio dos palmadas en el costado a quien era entonces presidente de la Federación y se alejó sonriendo. \"El beso que dio el señor Rubiales a la señora Hermoso, con su consentimiento, fue una manifestación de euforia , de máxima alegría y satisfacción por el extraordinario triunfo deportivo de la Selección Femenina al ganar la Copa Mundial de Fútbol Femenina. No hubo en la conducta del señor Rubiales ningún ánimo sexual o libidinoso\". \"¿Un besito?\" Tal y como avanzó EL ESPAÑOL , dos peritos —ambos, personas sordas lectores de labios— declararon ante el juez de la Audiencia Nacional que investigó estos hechos y confirmaron que Rubiales preguntó a Hermoso por dicho \"besito\". El escrito de defensa del granadino también incide en que la deportista concedió una entrevista a la Cadena COPE al finalizar la entrega de medallas. Allí, quitó hierro al beso y pronosticó que se quedaría en una \"anécdota\" sin importancia. \"Segurísimo que no va a ir a más\", señaló. Luis Rubiales, en su llegada a la Audiencia Nacional para declarar por el beso a Jenni Hermoso. Efe La defensa de Luis Rubiales relata que, \"a la vista del tratamiento informativo que a nivel nacional e internacional suscitó el beso\", responsables de los gabinetes de Presidencia y Comunicación de la RFEF plantearon que el directivo y la jugadora emitieran un comunicado conjunto. Ella, finalmente, lo rechaza. No obstante, en contra de la versión de la Fiscalía, Rubiales recalca que nunca \"pidió ni ordenó\" al resto de los investigados en esta causa que mediasen con la futbolista ni con miembros de su familia para hacerle cambiar de opinión. ¿Quiénes son el resto de imputados? Jorge Vilda (entonces seleccionador femenino y hoy seleccionador de Marruecos), Rubén Rivera (responsable en aquellos días de Marketing de la RFEF) y Albert Luque ( director deportivo de la Federación aquel verano). A cada uno de ellos, la Fiscalía les acusa de un delito de coacciones. Más testigos Además de las dos hijas de Rubiales, su defensa pide al Juzgado de lo Penal que comparezcan como testigos en el juicio otras personas vinculadas a la RFEF. Entre ellos, Montse Tomé (sucesora de Vilda como seleccionadora femenina), Miguel García Caba (responsable de Integridad de la RFEF), José María Timón (exdirector de gabinete del granadino), Luis de la Fuente (seleccionador nacional masculino), Rafa Hermoso (hermano de Jenni) y las futbolistas Alexia Putellas, Irene Paredes y Laia Codina. Asimismo, el escrito firmado por Tubau solicita que acudan al juicio los dos lectores de labios a ratificar su informe, así como dos expertos criminalísticos, autores de otro dictamen, para analizar durante la vista la \"comunicación no verbal y el lenguaje corporal\" de Luis Rubiales y de Jenni Hermoso durante la entrega de medallas.",

Speaking an hour before his cabinet meets on Tuesday to formally recognise Palestine – a decision that has infuriated Israel and triggered a diplomatic crisis between the two countries – Pedro Sánchez said the decision was based on justice and international law. He said: At the meeting of the council of ministers that will be held today, the government will approve the official recognition of Palestine as a state. With this decision, Spain joins the more than 140 countries that already recognise Palestine. This is a historic decision that has a single goal: to contribute to achieving peace between Israelis and Palestinians. The recognition of the state of Palestine is not only a matter of historical justice with the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people; it is also an imperative need to achieve peace. It is the only way to recognise the solution that we all recognise as the only possible one to achieve a future of peace – that of a Palestinian state that coexists alongside the state of Israel in peace and security . The state of Palestine must be viable with the West Bank and Gaza connected by a corridor and with East Jerusalem as its capital and it must be unified under the legitimate government of the Palestinian national authority.” Sánchez said that while it was not up to Spain to define another country’s borders, its position was aligned with those of the UN security council and the EU: “Therefore we won’t recognise change in the 1967 lines other than those agreed to by the parties.” The prime minister also stressed that “the recognition of Palestine isn’t against anyone – least of all Israel, a friendly nation that Spain values and holds in high regard and with whom we aim to foster the strongest possible relationship”. He said the decision reflected Spain’s “absolute rejection” of Hamas , which opposes the two-state solution. “From the outset, Spain has strongly condemned the terrorist attacks of 7 October ,” he said. “This clear condemnation is the resounding expression of our steadfast commitment in the fight against terrorism.” Sánchez said Spain would do all in its power to make the two-state solution a reality, and renewed his calls for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza , for humanitarian aid to be allowed into Gaza, and for all the Israeli hostages to be released. He also said Spain would work to bring about an international peace conference on the two-state solution. “The decision that Spain is solemnly adopting today is based on the respect for international law and the defence of the rules-based international order,” he said. “These are the principles that guide us always, no matter the context – both in Gaza/Palestine and in Ukraine. Spain will always defend the proposal and principles established in the UN charter.” Share 2h ago 08.21 BST Welcome and opening summary The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez , has said his cabinet will recognise a Palestinian state at its Tuesday morning meeting. Ireland and Norway were also to make official their recognition of a Palestinian state later in the day. While dozens of countries have recognised a Palestinian state, none of the major western powers has done so. “This is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,” said Sánchez, standing at the gates of the prime minister’s palace in Madrid, during a televised speech. The Socialist leader, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza. Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid insisting that the EU should take action against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. Norway, which is not an EU member but often aligns its foreign policy with the bloc, handed diplomatic papers to the Palestinian government over the weekend ahead of its formal recognition of a Palestinian state. Meanwhile Canada is the latest country to react to the airstrikes on Rafah, saying it is horrified by the civilian deaths. At least 45 people were been killed after the Israeli strike caused a huge blaze at a tented area for displaced people in Rafah, according to medics. Canada’s Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said in a statement: We are horrified by strikes that killed Palestinian civilians in Rafah. Joly added that Canada does not support the Israeli military operation in Rafah: This level of human suffering must come to an end. We demand an immediate ceasefire. They are comments that have been echoed by other global leaders who have urged the implementation of an international court of justice order to halt Israel’s assault . The United States said on Monday that Israel must make every possible effort to avoid civilian casualties after the deadly strike in Rafah. A US national security council spokesperson said in a statement: As we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians ... We are actively engaging the IDF and partners on the ground to assess what happened. But the NSC spokesperson also said that “Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,” before imploring more caution. The Israeli military said it had launched a probe into the strike which it said was carried out based on “precise intelligence information”. It launched the attack on Rafah hours after Hamas unleashed a barrage of rockets towards the Tel Aviv area, most of which were intercepted. In other developments: Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue fighting in Gaza despite widespread anger over Sunday’s strike in Rafah. At least 45 people were killed after an Israeli airstrike that caused a huge blaze at a tented area for displaced people in Rafah, medics have said. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said about half of the dead were women, children and older adults. The Israeli strike, one of the deadliest single incidents in the eight-month war to date, came two days after the international court of justice’s ruling ordering Israel to stop its operation in Rafah immediately. Netanyahu described the airstrike as a “tragic mishap” and said the incident occurred “despite our best efforts not to hurt them” . Israel’s top military prosecutor described the airstrike as “very grave” and said an investigation was under way. The Israeli military said its air force struck a Hamas compound and that the attack was carried out with “precise ammunition and on the basis of precise intelligence”. Hundreds of people gathered in Israeli cities on Monday after the Rafah attack to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Images of charred and dismembered children in Rafah after the Israeli strike have caused an outcry from global leaders and put ceasefire talks in jeopardy. Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages, said the Rafah casualties would complicate the protracted negotiations. Israeli media reported that Hamas had decided to pull out of the latest proposed talks over what its senior leadership described as a massacre. The UN security council is set to convene an emergency meeting Tuesday over the Rafah strike . Diplomats said the council would convene for an emergency session called by Algeria to discuss the attack. Spain, Ireland and Norway will formally recognise a Palestinian state Tuesday . Israel has described the decision as a “reward” for Hamas more than seven months into the devastating Gaza war. The three European countries believe their initiative has strong symbolic impact, which could encourage others to follow suit, reports AFP. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he is “outraged” by the Israeli airstrike on Rafah. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian citizens. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he posted to X on Monday. Italy’s defence minister, Guido Crosetto, said Israeli attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza were no longer justifiable in one of the strongest criticisms Rome has made so far against Israel’s war. Desperately needed aid deliveries to Gaza have ground to a halt, as the Rafah border crossing, and the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing are in effect blocked by the fierce fighting. About 200 aid trucks were supposed to enter Gaza through Israel’s Kerem Shalom crossing on Sunday after an agreement was reached with Egypt, but UN and Palestinian officials said on Monday that no aid supplies have been distributed. An Israeli strike targeting a motorcycle in southern Lebanon hit next to a hospital entrance Monday, killing the motorcycle driver and a hospital security guard and wounding several civilians nearby , local health officials said. It was not immediately clear who the driver was or why he was targeted in the strike in the town of Bint Jbeil, reports Associated Press. The Israeli army did not give a statement on the strike but said it had targeted other areas of southern Lebanon in response to “terrorist launches.” Egypt’s military says a border guard was killed in a shooting in the Rafah border area with Gaza on Monday, where Israeli forces are deployed, adding that a probe had been launched. “The Egyptian armed forces, through the competent authorities, are investigating a shooting incident in the Rafah border area which led to the martyrdom of a guard,” a military statement said. The Israeli military reported a “shooting incident” on the Egyptian border and said it was discussing the incident with Egypt, reports Agence France-Presse.

        "content": "On Tuesday, Deutsche Bank increased its price target on Mitchells & Butlers Plc (MAB:LN) (OTC: MBPFF) shares to £3.60, up from the previous target of £3.20. The firm continues to endorse a Buy rating on the company's stock. The revision follows Mitchells & Butlers' recent interim financial results, which highlighted significant improvements in the company's balance sheet. A substantial reduction in pension deficits and a £35 million cash return from escrow, which translates to an additional 6p per share, were key factors acknowledged by the analyst. The ability of Mitchells & Butlers to potentially convert debt into equity, amounting to roughly 8% of its market capitalization, was also noted as the company is on track to cover its annual debt amortization of approximately £140 million from its free cash flow. Operationally, Mitchells & Butlers is performing robustly with like-for-like sales growth of 7%, surpassing the rate of cost inflation. The company anticipates a decrease in utility costs by £45 million, a slowdown in food and beverage inflation to mid-single digits, and recognizes that the national living wage will continue to pose challenges for the sector. The improved cost outlook has prompted Deutsche Bank to increase its EBIT forecasts for Mitchells & Butlers by 5% for fiscal year 2024 and by 3% for fiscal year 2025. The analyst underscored the attractive valuation of the company, citing a 2024 estimated price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.9 times and a 20% discount to tangible net asset value, as reasons to reiterate the Buy rating.

        "content": "Leaders of South Korea, Japan, and China reaffirmed their commitment to promote peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula during their summit in Seoul on Monday, hours after North Korea announced a satellite launch plan. President Yoon Suk Yeol, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, and Chinese Premier Li Qiang reached the agreement after North Korea notified Japan of its plan to launch a space rocket carrying a military spy satellite sometime before June 4, Yonhap news agency reported. “We reaffirmed that maintaining peace, stability, and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia serves our common interest and is our common responsibility,” a joint declaration of the trilateral summit said. “We reiterated positions on regional peace and stability, denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, and the abduction issue, respectively. We agree to continue to make positive efforts for the political settlement of the Korean Peninsula issue,” it added. During a joint press conference, Yoon and Kishida emphasised the importance of denuclearisation on the Korean Peninsula. However, Li did not address denuclearisation directly, instead urging relevant parties to exercise restraint to prevent further escalation. This contrasts with the 2019 trilateral summit, where China also expressed support for efforts toward denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. During the session, Yoon and Kishida denounced North Korea’s satellite launch plan as a violation of the UN Security Council resolutions that ban its use of ballistic missile technology. Pyongyang said it will send three more satellites into space this year, following its first launch in November. “The international community must respond firmly,” Yoon said during a joint press briefing at the former President Cheong Wa Dae. Kishida echoed his concerns, urging Pyongyang to cease its activities. “If it proceeds, it will be a violation of UN Security Council resolutions. We strongly urge North Korea to cease this activity,” Kishida said. China’s Li called on all related countries to exercise restraint without a direct mention of North Korea. “China has consistently worked to promote peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and is pushing for a political resolution to the peninsula issue. Relevant parties should exercise restraint and prevent the situation from worsening and becoming more complicated,” Li said during the briefing. Li, China’s No. 2 official, also called for joint efforts to foster cooperation through “mutual respect and trust”. “Korea, Japan, and should properly handle sensitive issues and conflicts, consider each other’s core interests and significant concerns, and practice genuine multilateralism to jointly safeguard stability in the Northeast Asian region,” Li said. The trilateral session discussed ways to promote cooperation in six specific areas — economy and trade, sustainable development, health issues, science and technology, disaster and safety management, and people-to-people exchanges. The leaders also agreed to institutionalise the trilateral cooperation by holding the trilateral summit and ministerial meetings regularly. Monday’s session was the first three-way meeting since December 2019 after it was suspended for a prolonged period due to Covid-19 and historical disputes among the Asian neighbours. After the meeting, they attended a trilateral business summit at the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, engaging with business leaders of the three nations. During the summit, the leaders pledged to work together to promote cooperation in trade and investment, as well as supply chain resilience and export controls. “We will continue to work to ensure a global level playing field to foster a free, open, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent, inclusive, and predictable trade and investment environment,” the joint declaration said.

        "content": "Esha Deol is the daughter of iconic veteran actors Dharmendra and Hema Malini. Although the actress did not taste the same height of success as her parents, she did enjoy popularity in films like Dhoom, Na Tum Jaano Na Hum and more. Recently, the actress reacted to Ameesha Patel's shocking statement against star kids in the early 2000s and 2010s. In an interview with India Today, Esha Deol expressed her shock over Ameesha's 'star kids snatching films' remark. She said, ''My thoughts are very different. I think we were all very busy with our own lot of what we were given''. The actress also stated that she had 'some wonderful friendships with girls back then'. Deol also opined that 'to her knowledge', no one snatched films from anyone because everyone was too busy doing their own set of movies. ''Everyone was very busy and happy working in their own zone. Everyone was very friendly, all the girls, even the men very friendly, very warm, it was really nice.'' Esha Deol concluded, ''I think we were all doing so much work and had so much to do. It is not that any one of us was sitting without work.'' In an interview with Bollywood Hungama, Ameesha Patel recalled entering industry when all the newcomer actors belonged from a filmy background like Hrithik Roshan, Kareena Kapoor, Esha Deol, Abhishek Bachchan and more. She had said, ''There was a lot of jealousy, snatching films from under your nose''. ALSO SEE: Cover Image: Sourced",

        "content": "BRUSSELS — Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne will lead a rejuvenated Belgium side including a once-retired Alex Witsel at the European Championship next month. De Bruyne and Witsel were on the 25-man list unveiled by coach Domenico Tedesco on Tuesday. Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, preparing for the Champions League final, was not. Full back Maxim De Cuyper, who won the Belgian league with Club Brugge last weekend, was the only newcomer. De Bruyne and Witsel are remaining members of the so-called golden generation of Belgian players. While De Bruyne's presence was expected, Witsel's was a surprise after Tedesco dropped him from his first squad last year. Witsel soon after announced his retirement from international soccer and did not play in qualifying. But Tedesco said Witsel's recent showings with Atletico Madrid convinced him the 35-year-old midfielder was the right choice. “I have the best feelings with Axel,” Tedesco said. Tedesco said Courtois was not ready for Euro 2024, which starts on June 14 in Germany, after recently returning from injury. The men are at odds since a dispute last year, and Courtois announced in December he would miss the Euros. Tedesco succeeded Roberto Martinez as Belgium manager in February 2023. He has yet to lose a game in charge of the Red Devils. Belgium will face Slovakia, Romania and Ukraine in Group E. Belgium’s best result at the continental tournament was runner-up in 1980. ___ Belgium: Goalkeepers: Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest), Koen Casteels (Wolfsburg), Thomas Kaminski (Luton).

        "content": "Ubicado en el número 26 de la calle de Leganitos de Madrid, el restaurante Shangrila emerge como un destino culinario imprescindible para los amantes de la auténtica cocina asiática. Con el reconocido chef Liang Wang al mando , este establecimiento atrae a comensales de toda la ciudad que no dudan en hacer cola para disfrutar de sus exquisitas creaciones. Liang Wang no es un desconocido en la escena gastronómica de Madrid. Antes de apostar por Shangrila, el chef Wang era el genio detrás de un comedor subterráneo en la Plaza de España, donde su cocina se convirtió en un secreto bien guardado entre los incondicionales de la gastronomía china. El mítico restaurante chino de Plaza España cerró por las obras de remodelación de esta explanada. Era todo un emblema del centro de la capital y su traslado a la calle de Leganitos ha permitido a más personas descubrir las habilidades excepcionales y la pasión por la gastronomía de Liang Wang. Shangrila, situado en el mismo espacio que el primer restaurante chino con el mismo nombre abierto en Madrid en 1963, es ahora propiedad del grupo que gestiona El Buda Feliz. Un viaje gastronómico Al entrar en Shangrila, los comensales son transportados a un rincón de Asia. La decoración del restaurante, sencilla pero acogedora, complementa la experiencia culinaria. Cada plato es una obra de arte que refleja las raíces culturales y el meticuloso trabajo del chef Wang. El menú de Shangrila es un homenaje a la diversidad de la cocina asiática, con una amplia gama de platos que capturan la esencia de diferentes regiones. Entre las especialidades más destacadas se encuentran el pato laqueado, los 'dumplings' artesanales y los fideos hechos a mano. Cada bocado revela la maestría del chef y su dedicación a utilizar ingredientes frescos y técnicas tradicionales. Uno de los platos más aclamados es el 'Xiaolongbao' (bola de masa hervida), una especie de 'dumpling' relleno de carne de cerdo y un caldo sabroso que se libera en la boca al morderlo. Y es que Shangrila es un auténtico 'dim sum bar' especializado en estas deliciosas empanadillas al vapor, tradicionales de la cocina china. Los 'dim sum' incluyen rellenos de verduras, gambas, cerdo y ternera, se elaboran a mano de manera casera por el chef. Todos los platos tienen un precio de entre 5,75 y 5,95 euros por ración. Además de los 'dim sum', Shangrila ofrece una amplia gama de recetas chinas auténticas, todas elaboradas siguiendo fórmulas caseras. Entre los destacados están los salteados de pollo, ternera y gambas con verduras frescas como loto, espárragos y col china. También son muy populares sus sopas y tallarines, así como las costillas de cerdo y el pato asado, todos preparados con un toque especial que refleja la esencia de la cocina casera china. La experiencia picante y la casquería Para los amantes de los sabores picantes, Shangrila ofrece sartenes de pollo, ternera, gambas o calamares con verduras, todos preparados con la cantidad justa de picante para realzar los sabores sin abrumar el paladar. La casquería también tiene su lugar en el menú, con platos como los callos de ternera o cerdo salteados con puerro. Parte del encanto de Shangrila es la espera. Ver a la gente haciendo cola en la puerta del restaurante se ha convertido en una escena común en la calle de Leganitos. La anticipación y el entusiasmo de los comensales son palpables, y la espera solo aumenta el deseo de degustar los manjares que se ofrecen en el interior.",

        "description": "Bad cholesterol has become an issue with thousands across the globe facing changing lifestyle patterns. Including ways to tackle it becomes crucial to our well-being.",
        "content": "Cholesterol is found in the blood and is responsible for the formation of healthy cells. However, high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), commonly known as \"bad cholesterol,\" can lead to health problems. The accumulation of bad cholesterol in the arteries steers to the formation of plaque. This plaque can narrow or block arteries, leading to atherosclerosis, which increases the risk of heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes. Yes, dietary changes can significantly impact your LDL cholesterol levels. Certain foods can help lower bad cholesterol by either absorbing cholesterol from the bloodstream, reducing cholesterol production in the liver, or preventing cholesterol absorption in the gut. Let's explore six foods that can help fight bad cholesterol and how to incorporate them into your diet. Oats are rich in soluble fibre, particularly beta-glucan, which can reduce LDL cholesterol. Soluble fiber binds to cholesterol in the digestive system, preventing it from being absorbed into the bloodstream. Start your day with a bowl of oatmeal. You can also add oat bran to smoothies, and yogurts, or bake it into muffins and bread. Omega-3 found in fatty fish can lower triglycerides, reduce inflammation, and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or \"good\" cholesterol, which helps remove LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. Grill, bake, or broil the fish for a healthy and delectable meal. You can also add fish to salads, tacos, or pasta dishes. Some decades back, the US government released warnings about the damage the devil Cholesterol can do to our body. 40... Nuts such as almonds, walnuts, and pistachios are rich in monounsaturated fats, fibre, and plant sterols, which can lower LDL cholesterol. Plant sterols compete with cholesterol for absorption in the digestive system, reducing cholesterol levels. Snack on a handful of nuts, add them to your morning or yogurt, or use them as a crunchy topping for salads and desserts. Be mindful of portion sizes, as nuts are calorie-dense. Avocados are packed with monounsaturated fats and fibre, both of which are beneficial in lowering LDL cholesterol. They also contain beta-sitosterol, a plant sterol that helps reduce cholesterol absorption. Add slices to sandwiches, salads, or smoothies. You can also make guacamole or use avocado as a spread on toast. , lentils, and chickpeas are excellent sources of soluble fibre, which can reduce cholesterol absorption in the gut. They also provide plant-based protein and essential nutrients. Incorporate legumes into soups, stews, salads, and casseroles. Replace meat with legumes in dishes like tacos, burgers, or pasta sauces for a plant-based alternative. Olive oil, especially extra-virgin olive oil, is high in monounsaturated fats and antioxidants. It can help reduce LDL cholesterol while boosting HDL cholesterol levels. Use as a primary cooking fat. Drizzle it over salads, and vegetables, or use it as a base for salad dressings and marinades. Remember, these dietary changes should complement a healthy lifestyle that includes regular exercise and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. By making these adjustments, you can take significant steps toward a healthier heart and a longer life.",

        "content": "Richard Madeley and Nigel Farage clash in fiery debate on GMB as ex-UKIP leader faces backlash for claiming 'growing number' of young Muslims do not subscribe to British values By Rory Tingle, Home Affairs Correspondent For Mailonline Published: 09:32 BST, 28 May 2024 | Updated: 10:02 BST, 28 May 2024 e-mail 57 View comments Nigel Farage clashed with Richard Madeley today as the Good Morning Britain host challenged his controversial comments on Muslims by asking, 'What on earth were you talking about?' The Reform UK honorary president provoked a backlash on Sunday when he warned of the 'growing number of young people in this country who do not subscribe to British values' and 'loathe much of what we stand for'. He later clarified he was talking about Muslims. Mr Madeley challenged the former UKIP leader on his comments this morning by quoting the findings of a major review of the existing polling carried out in 2018 by IPSOS Mori. 'They found absolutely conclusively that Muslims in the UK attach more importance on being British than the general population,' he said. '85% feel they truly belong to Britain, 55% feel that their national identity as British is very important to them and that compares to 44% of the general population. So I'm bound to ask, what on earth were you talking about there?' Nigel Farage was challenged today on Good Morning Britain for his comments about Muslims Richard Madeley quoted a major review of the existing polling carried out in 2018 by IPSOS Mori which found 85% of British Muslims feel they truly belong to Britain In response, Mr Farage said he wanted to provide 'context' about what he said on Sunday in an interview with Trevor Phillips on Sky News . He said: 'What I said is that a growing number of young people do not subscribe to British values. In fact, despise them in many ways. 'And all of your viewers would have seen the local elections where in parts of our inner cities we saw sectarian politics - people voting purely on religious lines, councillors getting elected and screaming Allahu Akbar...' Read More Tory minister Steve Baker slams 'ignorant and offensive' Nigel Farage for claiming young British Muslims 'loathe much of what we stand for' as he accuses ex-UKIP leader of 'clear and intolerable bigotry' He then quoted recent polling by JL Partners commissioned by the Henry Jackson Society. 'It showed that 23% of 18 to 24-year-old of young Muslims living in Britain think that jihad is a good thing,' Mr Farage said. 'Now that of course is not a British value in any way at all and its a very disturbing trend that's particularly prevalent among the young.' Mr Madeley replied: 'The poll that you just quoted from has been very heavily criticised as self-selecting - people were basically drawn in through a series of clicks and by the time they were asked to register their opinion they had already made their minds up. 'You also said in the interview that you could take someone to a particular street in Oldham and there would be nobody there who speaks English. 'Well again that's just not true - the Office of National Statistics say that only 0.7% of people in Oldham don't speak English - that's less than one in a hundred.' Mr Farage said it was possible to 'argue about numbers and statistics' but it was 'undoubtedly true' that there is an increasing number of young people in Britain who ' don't only not subscribe to our values - they openly support Hamas'. Mr Farage (pictured on Sunday) has decided not to stand in the general election for his Reform party Steve Baker became the latest Tory minister to challenge Mr Farage's comments as 'ignorant and offensive'. Mr Baker said in an social media post this morning: 'It is not right that good British people should be slandered like this and I will defend them.' The Wycombe MP praised the contribution of British Muslims in his Buckinghamshire constituency, where he is seeking to defend a 4,000-vote majority at the general election. Read More TAJ HARGEY: No wonder just a quarter of British Muslims believe the October 7 attacks took place when so many hardliners are allowed to flourish here 'I am proud that in Wycombe, British Muslims are councillors, mayors, council chairs and parliamentary candidates, justices of the peace and the present High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire,' Mr Baker added. 'They are teachers and headteachers, doctors and pillars of our society. These are my colleagues, friends and supporters and I am glad. 'They deserve much better than to be the object of this clear and intolerable bigotry. This is why I have always fought Islamophobia and why I will continue to do so, supporting the creation of a practical definition.' Mr Farage, who has decided not to stand in the general election for his Reform party, mentioned Muslims while commenting on Rishi Sunak's plans to revive national service for 18-year-old's, which he called 'a joke'. Mr Farage added: 'It's totally impractical. The Army has shrunk from 100,000 to 75,000 in 14 years of conservatism. 'And most interestingly, we have a growing number of young people in this country who do not subscribe to British values. In fact, loathe much of what we stand for.' Challenged over who he was referring to, Mr Farage replied: 'Oh, I think we see them on the streets of London every Saturday.' Pressed on whether he was referring to Muslims, he added: 'We are.'

'The vast proportion of British Muslims are wonderful, peace-loving, community-minded people, certainly in the North East where I'm based, we have fantastic communities and they are a really important part of our social fabric,' Ms Trevelyan told the radio station. 'There are a very small proportion for whom they want to challenge those values that we hold dear in the UK, which are British values, and there we need to continue to work in community to bring those people to this. 'The UK has incredible values of freedom of speech, freedom of choice... these are incredibly important values, but they have to be nurtured and looked after , and where there are those who would threaten them we need to make sure that we deal with that.' She said it was not a problem specific to any religion, adding: 'There are people who do not wish to stand alongside the values and laws that we have, and we continue to have to defend those.'

        "content": "Nearly half of women in the Netherlands experience sexual harassment at work, according to a study by the trade union CNV among 3,000 workers. “This shows that despite the widespread attention to this theme in the media and all kinds of government programs, it is still a widespread problem in the workplace,” CNV chairman Piet Fortuin told the . The survey showed that 42 percent of women have been sexually harassed at work at least once. They report things like sexually suggestive comments, catcalling, and unwanted sexual pictures. 17 percent of men reported experiencing sexual harassment at work. CNV found that sexual harassment is much more common in small companies with fewer than ten employees. Employees of SMEs are more likely to be sexually harassed by their boss and least likely to know where to report it. According to Fortuin, this is because small companies often don’t have a protocol in place to deal with this problem. “Moreover, in small companies, there is often an old-boy atmosphere. Like: we’re having a good time together, you shouldn’t complain like that, it’s just a joke. Victims more often feel trapped in these companies,” Fortuin said. Although employers are required by law to have a policy to combat sexual harassment, half of organizations don’t have one, according to CNV. “The smaller the company, the less protocol or policy there is,” Fortuin said. “Developing policy demonstrably works. Larger organizations usually have this and are less likely to experience sexual harassment. For this reason, all organizations must quickly develop a protocol or policy. No matter how small they are.”",

        "content": "The riot police surrounded a group of dozens of pro-Palestinian demonstrators at Dam Square in Amsterdam last night and arrested 73 of them for various criminal offenses. The demonstration started on Monday evening at the American consulate on Museumplein. The group eventually moved toward Dam Square, where about 100 protesters held a pro-Israel demonstration organized by the Christian party SGP. The police surrounded part of the group of pro-Palestinian protesters on the corner of Kalverstraat and Dam Square and arrested them for disrupting public order. The police put them on a GVB bus to transport them away. Several dozen other pro-Palestine demonstrators on the other side of the police action tried to stop the bus from leaving, a police spokesperson told . “Bicycles were pulled from racks and thrown in front of the bus.” The riot police intervened, also striking the protesters. According to the police, protesters also attacked the police on the bus on the way to the cell complex. “Officers were kicked, scratched, and insulted.” The riot police also ended a pro-Palestinian rally at Radboud University in Nijmegen. A group of around 50 students occupied a building on campus, demanding that the university break its ties with Israel. After the university asked the protesters to leave, the riot police broke through the barricades and took the protesters outside one by one. The evacuation was completed at around 12:30 a.m. with no arrests, Omroep Gelderland .",
