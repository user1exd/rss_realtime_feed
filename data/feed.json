        "content": "Pitso Mosimane's camp have lauded the coach's efforts despite being unable to avoid relegation with Abha Club in the Saudi Pro League. It was always going to be a different challenge for the renowned coach who usually is on the top-end of the table chasing silverware, finding himself with the task of saving a club from relegation. To his credit, Mosimane and his technical team nearly pulled off the impossible, placing their relegation status in their own hands going into the final match of the season, though ultimately it wasn't to be. Despite falling desperately short of their mandate, Mosimane's camp MT Sports and Marketing, led by his wife and agent Moira Tlhagale commended 'Jingles' for his valiant efforts in trying to keep Abha Club afloat. \"We are immensely proud of Coach Mosimane and his technical team for their unwavering dedication and tremendous effort this season. They were brave enough to take on a challenge that most would have steered clear of. Only missing out on survival by 2 points, the progress and spirit displayed by the team under Coach Mosimane's leadership has been inspiring,\" Tlhagale said in a statement. Kaizer Chiefs followers were hoping Naturena would be Mosimane's next stop. . It remains to be seen if Mosimane will be available for Chiefs, but his relegation at Abha Club has opened the door slightly for the Glamour Boys. Mosimane, meanwhile, says the experience at Abha will make him a better coach moving forward, with the coach's next move yet to be decided. \"It is incredibly disappointing to come so close and fall short. I am proud of how the players responded to the challenge and fought until the end. Their commitment and heart have been extraordinary, and although we did not achieve our ultimate goal, we can hold our heads high for the effort and progress made. Thank you to the Abha Club board, management, and fans; they have been pillars of strength throughout this challenging season. The learnings from this experience will certainly make us better coaches and players,\" he said.",

        "content": "A return to the PSL remains a possibility for former Kaizer Chiefs star Khama Billiat, sources have indicated to the Siya crew. Following his surprise exit from Chiefs at the end of last season, Billiat went on to sign with Yadah FC in Zimbabwe to revive his career. But that was after he spent almost eight months without a club as all the attempts to get him a deal in the PSL were unsuccessful. When Billiat signed with Yadah, the plan was for him to regain fitness after he spent a long time without playing competitive football, with the plan being to get him a deal overseas, possibly in the Middle East. However, with an overseas move seemingly unlikely for the 33-year-old at this stage, it is understood that a return to Mzansi could be next on his plans as he will want to finish the remaining few years of his career playing at the highest level. “Look, Khama Billiat remains a top player and one of the best of his generation. He is still as hungry for competitive football at the highest level as he was when he played for big clubs such as Sundowns and Chiefs. Yes, a PSL return can’t be ruled out for him as part of the plans for next season,” said the source. “When he went to train with SuperSport United, maybe his fitness and confidence levels were not as up to the required standards as they should have been. Going back to Zimbabwe where he has been training with the team and managed to get the much-needed minutes of competitive football helped the guy to be where he should be with his fitness. The next move for him could be in the PSL,” the source said.",

        "content": "Following his angry outburst at being substituted during the CAF Champions League final and with rumoured negotiations over a new deal being underway, Al Ahly manager Marcel Koller's stance on Percy Tau's future has reportedly been revealed. The South African attacker has achieved a lot in terms of team and individual accomplishments over the past year. However, there has recently been a lot of uncertainty around the 30-year-old’s future at the Cairo International Stadium. Tau is approaching the final year of his contract with the Red Devils, and it is believed that talks over a new contract for him are currently underway. During the 2022/23 season, the Witbank native was undoubtedly Ahly’s best player, but in this latest campaign, his form has seemingly declined. It is because of this that the record African champions were believed to be reluctant to give into his salary demands. According to however, his manager Koller is still keen on keeping the Bafana Bafana man because he rates his technical ability highly and believes he still has what it takes to make the difference in decisive moments for the club. The same report also claims that if a strong alternative to Tau is made available, then Koller will have no problem letting the former Mamelodi Sundowns star leave the club. This news comes shortly after it was reported that the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations bronze medallist was after being the first Al Ahly player to be substituted off the second leg of the CAF Champions League final against Esperance de Tunis on the weekend.

        "content": "Margherita, May 28: Following the tragic incident where three coal miners were feared dead inside a ‘rat-hole’ mine in Assam’s Tinsukia district on May 26, authorities have launched an investigation. The mine reportedly caved in due to a landslide. The incident prompted immediate action from the Margherita sub-divisional administration and Margherita Police. Acting on a tip-off, police conducted an early morning raid at the residence of a local coal trader, Ron Lunsang, in the Tikok area of Ledu. The operation, which began at 2 a.m., led to the discovery and seizure of approximately Rs 3 crore from Lungsang’s home. Lungsang is suspected to be involved in the illegal mining operations at the Ledu Tikok West mining area, where the miners went underground alive but failed to return. Authorities believe that Lungsang’s illegal activities may have directly contributed to the fatal accident. Notably, the rescue operation is still on to retrieve the three individuals from the rat hole. Lungsang is currently absconding, and the police are intensifying efforts to locate and apprehend him.",

        "description": "Frustrating, free-flowing and full of finesse. Florida is incapable of being rattled and is often the team instigating the extracurriculars.",
        "content": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- Like their , the are a rare breed. The Panthers are physical and feisty. Skilled and speedy. As likely to outscore as outhit an opponent -- perhaps in the same game. Florida can be an all-around overachiever. The team has top-tier talent -- on both sides of the puck -- with a killer instinct. It's an enviable combination, one the Panthers used to separate from the pack these past 12 months. But Florida wasn't always so self-assured. There were years when the Panthers were an afterthought -- a warm-weather novelty. But over time, Florida rewrote the narrative and grew into a team with powerhouse potential. But there was still something missing: those key ingredients to take the Panthers from one-and-done playoff runs to perennial Stanley Cup contenders. It didn't happen overnight. The changes were deliberate and calculated. And what has come out of them is the Florida bruisers we see now, entrenched in a second consecutive Eastern Conference finals bout, with an eye on making another Cup Final appearance -- if they can vanquish the , who currently lead their best-of-seven, 2-1. This is the first time Florida has trailed in a postseason series this spring, after vanquishing the and in five and six games, respectively. And they had a specific rhythm in those matchups: frustrating, free-flowing and full of finesse. Florida is annoyingly incapable of being rattled. That's the Bad Boy Panthers at their best. It has worked to this stage. Channeling that same energy likely is the formula to get Florida back on the right side of its battle with the Rangers. aren't built in a day. Neither was this version of the Panthers. It was late May 2022 and Florida was skating the most gut-wrenching handshake line in franchise history. The Panthers had compiled a 122-point regular season to earn the Presidents' Trophy as the club with the best regular-season record. They were supposed to be Cup contenders. Instead, they'd been swept out of a second-round series by their in-state rival (and recent two-time Cup champion) . That ending hit Florida hard. The Panthers' lineup was filled with talented skaters, led by and his 115-point campaign in the 2021-22 regular season, meant to carry them to a proverbial next level. Huberdeau went dead-quiet in the playoffs though, producing one goal and five points in 10 games -- and adding just two helpers against the Lightning. Florida seemed to be spinning its wheels. Despite earning regular-season success, the Panthers hadn't advanced past the second round in a playoff series since losing in the 1996 Stanley Cup Final. Heck, the Panthers had made only six postseason appearances total since that defeat. Florida needed a shift. It went with something seismic. It was late July 2022, nearly two months to the day since Florida's playoff loss. The Panthers had already parted ways with interim head coach Andrew Brunette and brought in veteran bench boss Paul Maurice. Change was underway. And then came the believe-it-or-not headline: Huberdeau -- along with defenseman -- had been traded by Florida to Calgary for , who was also signed to an eight-year extension worth $9.5 million per season. The Panthers moving on from Huberdeau was unexpected, but entirely intriguing. It's not often a team trades its silky-smooth leading scorer after the most productive campaign of his career, and even less common to target a \"pest\" like Tkachuk in return. But Tkachuk was more than just the Flames' agitating playmaker; he was also coming off a career-best season with 42 goals and 102 points. The swap signaled Florida was ready for a redo, taking its first step toward crafting an identity that, once defined and embraced, could propel the Panthers farther than they'd been in 25 years. about how Florida plays the game. Something special. Boston Bruins forward saw it firsthand in the Bruins' second-round playoff series, when the Panthers sent Boston packing for the second year in a row. Florida managed to out-Bruin the Bruins with snarl, sass and skill. The gut punch proved fatal for Boston's postseason hopes, a harsh reality for van Riemsdyk to revisit while also respecting how the Panthers put up such a fight. \"They have a lot of good players, but there's that certain extra level of ... I don't know if nastiness is the right word, but just that competitive sort of spirit,\" van Riemsdyk said. \"A lot of those guys have that as one of their top attributes, that sort of in-your-face style that they play. They're a physical team and can be an agitating team because of being in your face and under your skin. That, combined with all the skill and the skating levels and hockey sense these guys have, it's the key combination with their group.\" That wasn't always Florida's calling card. The trade for Tkachuk seemed to let the Panthers pivot. Not that their results were seamless immediately. There are just four teams left vying for the Stanley Cup. Check out our coverage, with TV times, the latest news, results and more. Florida started poorly in Tkachuk's first season. At the 2023 All-Star break, the Panthers weren't even in a playoff position. Florida clawed its way out of the Atlantic Division dregs from there though to reach the postseason as the Eastern Conference's final seed. The Panthers took that designation personally. Florida rallied to knock off the Presidents' Trophy-winning Bruins in their first-round series, breezed past the in the second round, swept the in the conference finals -- and then ran out of gas against the in a disheartening Cup Final loss. That experience set the table for Florida's next chapter. The Panthers were more \"big dog\" than underdog in 2023-24, finishing atop the Atlantic standings with a 110-point effort. Tkachuk was Florida's second-leading scorer (with 26 goals and 88 points in 80 games) to go with the team's third-most penalty minutes (88). The only Panthers regular ahead of Tkachuk in that category? . He and Tkachuk are cut from the same cloth: Bennett contributed 20 goals and 41 points through 69 games, with 100 penalty minutes to boot. In the postseason, both skaters have been invaluable -- Tkachuk paces the Panthers with 18 points, while Bennett has three goals and six points. Overall, Florida has also doled out the most hits (632) and collected the most penalty minutes (191). Yet here they are standing strong with an opportunity to make repeat Cup Final visits. If the Panthers' particular brand of circus needs its ringleaders, then Tkachuk and Bennett fit the bill. \"[Bennett] plays a style that is maybe the prototypical Florida Panther identity,\" Maurice said. \"The way we like to play, he embodies that. And then there's what it does for the rest of the lineup.\" Maurice's assessment rings true. Just ask the guys who play against Bennett and Tkachuk at this most critical, heightened time of year. \"It's that unicorn type of player that can be comfortable playing those multiple styles,\" van Riemsdyk said. \"A bunch of guys on their team would qualify to be put in the category like that. You point to a guy like Matthew Tkachuk. He's only been there for now, what, two seasons? And they've had a great deal of playoff games, won a lot of playoff rounds, so it's easy to point to him [as a spark]. \"Sam Bennett has a lot of those characteristics [too]. It's just that good mix of having some of that [extra] stuff in their games, but they're also guys who can play and do it all. And those guys are built for that playoff style. It's hard to play against and what makes them so successful [as a team].\" Florida lost Bennett briefly in the playoffs when he was injured in Game 2 of the Panthers' first-round series against Tampa Bay. He was unavailable until Game 3 against Boston, and Maurice noted prior to the Eastern Conference finals how Tkachuk's evolution -- from nuisance to nuanced -- has made the winger more dangerous. \"He's been outstanding,\" Maurice said of Tkachuk. \"We lost Sam Bennett ... and that's when not only did [Tkachuk] step up [playing] with , but he was also leading the [team].\" Get exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers. • • • Maurice said Tkachuk has grown into a leadership role, notably since the start of the season. \"He was more disciplined; he's matured with this group over two years,\" Maurice said. \"I would never bet against him coming up with some heroics, but it's certainly not the only thing we have to expect from him now.\" Florida has followed Tkachuk's lead. The Panthers aren't concerned with propriety or being well-liked; they've learned how to toe the line while staying on the right side of NHL law, even if the opposition doesn't always agree with the calls -- or lack thereof. That was on display in the Boston series when Bennett -- in his Game 3 return -- smashed into and caused an upper-body injury that held Marchand out until Game 6. There was no penalty on the play, and Marchand said he thought Bennett on the interaction. Bennett drew the Bruins' ire again in Game 4 when he shoved into goaltender and then scored a power-play goal that tied the game for Florida (and the Panthers went on to win, 3-2). Sam Bennett takes advantage on the power play and nets a huge goal for the Panthers to even the score against the Bruins. If Florida has a certain swagger, it's coming from the bad boy personas who aren't concerned about reputation, only setting the tone. It's no coincidence was also mixing it up with Marchand in that series via . Or that was spotted in a with Bruins' forward in Game 2, when Florida and Boston racked up a total of 148 penalty minutes and 146 hits. That's just another day at the office for these Panthers. \"Their team really feeds off of that, when they get guys that drag other guys on the team into that type of [physical] game,\" van Riemsdyk said. \"I think they do a good job of sticking together within that, and everyone starts to play that style where it's very much hit-or-be-hit. Even guys who have played a long time in the league, who are there for their first year or two, that stuff rubs off on them too. And obviously the last couple of years they've been successful in the playoffs by sticking to that formula.\" its secret sauce by accident. There was a method to the madness, a process of trial and error bleeding into their eventual emergence from one season to the next as, ideally, a team better suited to achieving the ultimate success. \"The word that popped in my head is last year was a wilder group, and I mean that on the ice,\" Maurice said. \"It was so much energy. We still have it. But I guess the better way to describe this group is they're a more focused group; they're not quite as funny. They don't appreciate my humor quite as much. Because they're like, 'Get on with it. Get to the important stuff.' \"They're very focused on hockey, and that was true right through [the season]. A little more serious. Last year's team needed to be a little wilder or a little bit more on edge. But this team is deeper and is far more disciplined on the ice than last year's team.\" The 2024 NHL draft will take place June 28-29 in Las Vegas. Get caught up on everything you need to know about the top prospects with draft preview content from Rachel Doerrie: would agree. The Panthers defenseman has been sensational in the postseason, collecting three goals and nine points in 14 games while averaging over 23 minutes per game. He had a critical goal for the Panthers in Game 3 against the Rangers, sending a tying marker past in the third period to trigger overtime. Florida then lost in the extra frame when beat with the game winner. That put the Panthers behind in a series for the first time in these playoffs. Getting back on track means challenging Shesterkin more in front of the net -- without getting in penalty trouble. Forsling is confident Florida's evolution will allow them to execute with the right balance. \"You've got to play a little bit on the line, and I think we've been very good and successful being on the right side of it compared to last year,\" Forsling said. \"I think it punished us a little bit last year, took a few too many penalties, but this year we've been [better] with that.\" The Panthers have also been able to keep the postseason swings in perspective. Outside criticism doesn't affect the team's confidence. There's little chance any internal doubt will seep in or push Florida away from what they know offers an edge. \"We're prepared to make this a hard series for seven games,\" Bennett said. \"That was our mindset right from the beginning. It's a fine line in the playoffs. You're trying to be as physical as possible, but there's a line, and you're trying your best not to cross that line and toe [it] for the whole series. I think we've done a pretty good job with that. But we can always improve on that, as well.\" What made Florida's loss in Game 3 so frustrating was that they put on a dominant performance. The Panthers outshot New York 37-23, held a 108-43 advantage in shot attempts and came back from a 4-2 deficit in the third. In many ways, Florida did everything right. But the outcome was wrong, so the Panthers were back the next day asking questions on how to improve -- with answers easily accessible based on how they've prevailed in the postseason so far. \"Sometimes you're just looking for a certain attitude,\" Maurice said. \"Where can we get better? Where can we turn that into a win? That's the coach's job, to make them walk out of the room certain of how to win. That growl, [it's] just there's nothing casual. We [should] be wired and ready to go in that room, the intensity level would be pretty high, and we make sure they're certain about what we're doing.\" Even the best plan can't guarantee success, though. The Rangers are a formidable, impressive and dynamic opponent capable of overcoming their own flaws and finding success on the toughest nights. The Panthers' urgency must absolutely be on display from puck drop for Game 4 on Tuesday. Heading back to New York with a split is what matters. Florida just needs the right road map to get there. \"Definitely [a tough team] when they play to their strengths within the way that they're built,\" van Riemsdyk said. \"They have some high-end players at a lot of the key positions, and they have a lot of depth. We see a lot of different guys contributing for them. That's why it seems like they're definitely a team that's built for the playoff-style game.\"",

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Correspondent who resides in the area reports that the explosion of the tyres and the ensuing billows of smoke made residents living near the filling station to flee for safety. Observations by NAN revealed that staff from the filling station hurried out with fire extinguishers to combat the fire, which erupted around 9:00 p.m., just a few meters from the station’s entrance. Emergency responders, including Federal and State Fire Services, as well as the Lagos State Emergency Management Authority (LASEMA), swiftly arrived at the scene following distress calls from the community. Upon arrival, the emergency teams assessed the unregistered truck carrying the petrol and raised concerns about safety measures while questioning the driver and filling station management. They provided guidance and oversaw the safe discharge of the fuel using a long hose to transfer the petroleum product from the stranded tanker into the filling station’s reservoirs. The Station Manager of the Conoil filling station, Mr Kunle Oniya, informed the emergency responders that the station possessed 20 fire extinguishers, which were promptly utilised to contain the fire and prevent its spread. The incident led to a traffic gridlock, with vehicles unable to move in the area for nearly an hour. Some residents shared their experiences of the ordeal with NAN. A resident, Malam Shehu, recounted abandoning his dinner upon witnessing the fiery explosion. He expressed gratitude that the fire was contained before causing further damage. Another resident, simply known as Iya Abigail, described hearing people shouting while she was playing games, prompting her to flee in confusion wearing her nightclothes. She prayed for continued safety in the community. An elderly resident, who preferred anonymity, urged filling stations in the area to prioritise safety and the welfare of residents. She noted that filling stations typically had insurance against fire and other disasters and suggested extending such coverage to vulnerable buildings in their host communities. Recalling the chaotic events, she said that she heard the sound of an emergency whistle to alert the neighbourhood before hastily evacuating her home. “I was watching TV and when the incidence occurred, I had to blow the emergency whistle to alert the neighborhood but I quickly dressed up before running out of the house,” she said.

        "content": "KOCHI: Kottayam and Ernakulam are now blanketed by dark clouds giving premonition of the incoming heavy rains. IMD has put both these districts on red alert for Tuesday. Meanwhile, experts from CUSAT pointed to cloudburst as the reason behind the heavy downpour in Kochi that lasted for about two hours. According to Professor S Abhilash from CUSAT, Kochi recorded 100 mm of rain in just one and a half hours on Tuesday; which points to an extreme amount of precipitation. This was recorded in CUSAT’s rain gauge. Around 400 houses were flooded in Kalamassery while around 200 houses got inundated in Melepadam. Currently, two relief camps have been started in Kalamassery. In another incident, a car parked in Pathadipalam Museum Nagar started floating in the rain alarming the locals nearby. Ropes were used by locals to stop the car from floating. In Kottayam, the Meenachil river is on the brink of overflowing. Waterlogging was also reported in Kaduthuruthy. In Appanchira, the road adjacent to a petrol pump got flooded in the rain. Landslides destroyed two houses in Thalanadu. A goat died after getting trapped in a landslide. Low-lying lands in Kanjirappally to Erattupetta got flooded in the rains. Many families were moved to shelter homes in this region. Landslides were reported in Bharananganam.

        "content": "The first typhoon of the year in the northwest Pacific Ocean is expected to continue intensifying but will not have a direct impact on China’s weather, a meteorological expert said on Monday. Tropical Cyclone Ewiniar strengthened from a tropical storm on Sunday morning to a typhoon over Philippine coastal waters by Sunday evening, according to China’s National Meteorological Center. At 2 pm Monday, the typhoon’s center was located east of the Philippines at 16.2 degrees north latitude and 123.2 degrees east longitude. It packed winds of up to 136.8 kilometers per hour near its center. The typhoon is traveling northeast at 20 kilometers per hour and is likely to strengthen further, the center said. Chief forecaster Gao Shuanzhu said the typhoon’s strength is expected to weaken within two days as it progresses toward higher latitudes and enters the westerlies, eventually transforming into an extratropical cyclone and dissipating within five days. While Ewiniar has triggered landslides, heavy rainfall and casualties in the Philippines, Gao said the typhoon has not exhibited extreme winds and is not expected to have a direct impact on China. However, Gao said several parts of China can expect rainy weather in the coming days. The National Meteorological Center renewed a yellow alert for heavy rainfall on Monday morning. It is the third-highest level in a four-tier warning system. From Monday to Tuesday, eastern and southern areas, including the provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Yunnan, Sichuan and Anhui, can expect heavy to extreme rainfall. The center also forecast strong convective weather in those areas.

Met Office spokesman Stephen Dixon said: “The UK is in the midst of some unsettled weather at the moment. “It will be a little bit hit and miss within warning areas, some lightning strikes and travel disruptions lend an unsettled feel for today (Tuesday).” Particularly heavy downpours in some areas could see roads cut off.

Further south will see a continued mix of sunshine and showers for many. “That showery theme, with the potential for some heavier bursts, continues for much of the country on Thursday, though there is also likely to be some sunny spells at times, which could feel quite pleasant away from the rain. “There is a change signalled for the weekend, with a ridge of high pressure likely to reduce rainfall totals and bring some warm, dry weather for many, though details will become clearer in the coming days.”",

        "content": "The National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) have proposed sugar content limits for packaged foods and beverages. This is the first time such a recommendation has been made, as reported by Economic Times . The new guidelines could potentially impact a wide array of products including branded soft drinks, juices, cookies, ice-creams, and cereals. Industry response to new sugar guidelines The new sugar content guidelines were reportedly not developed in consultation with major packaged food and beverage companies. These companies plan to jointly approach the ICMR and NIN within 10 days regarding this issue. Executives from these firms have labeled the new guidelines as impractical, expressing concerns that if enforced, most companies will need to alter their product formulations. Sugar content controversy in popular products This development comes after reports of added sugar in products like Cerelac and Bournvita. A Swiss investigative organization found that Nestle added sugar, either as sucrose or honey, to samples of Nido and Cerelac, both infant food products. In December 2023, Cadbury's Bournvita reduced its added sugar content by 14.4% following social media criticism led by influencer Revant Himatsingka. To recall, the government recently requested e-commerce websites to remove Bournvita from their \"healthy drinks\" section.",

        "content": "Suryakumar Yadav will be critical to India's run in the upcoming 2024 ICC T20 World Cup , which will be played in West Indies and USA. SKY has truly been a menace in the format as he has been dominating the T20I batting rankings for over a year. He has also featured in two previous T20 WCs. Let's decode his T20I numbers away from home. Second-best average, best strike rate In away and neutral T20Is combined, SKY owns 1,237 runs across 32 innings. His average of 47.57 is only second to Virat Kohli (52.34) among batters with 1,000-plus T20I runs away from home. SKY's strike rate of 173.98 in this regard is also the highest. He also owns the joint-most T20I tons outside home (3). His tally also includes nine fifties. Decent numbers in WI and USA As mentioned, WI and USA will host the mega event. SKY has fared decently in these nations. The veteran has mustered 85 runs across two T20 innings in USA. In WI, he owns 216 runs across six matches at a fine strike rate of 161.19. He owns two fifties in WI and one in USA. Sensational numbers in England, Australia, and New Zealand SKY has returned with 171 runs across three T20Is in England. His strike rate in the nation reads 201.17. In New Zealand, he has accumulated 124 runs across two outings at a strike rate of 203.27. He owns a century apiece in England and New Zealand. In Australia, he has accumulated 239 runs across six games, striking at 189.68 (50s: 3). His numbers in other venues SKY has mustered 156 runs across just two innings in SA at a strike rate of 169.56. He made a 34-ball 50 in his only T20I outing in Sri Lanka. The dasher could only manage 15 runs across two innings in Ireland. In UAE, he has tallied 181 runs at 36.20 as his strike rate reads 158.77. Here are his overall records Having played 60 T20Is, Suryakumar has accumulated 2,141 runs at 45.55. SKY has the joint-second-most Player-of-the-Match awards in the shortest format (14). He is the only player to own T20I tons in four different nations - South Africa, England, New Zealand, and India. Suryakumar has an overall strike rate of 171.55 in T20Is, the highest by any batter (Minimum: 1,000 runs). Joint-second-fastest batter to accomplish 2,000 T20I runs During the South Africa series in December 2023, SKY became the joint-second-fastest batter to accomplish 2,000 T20I runs. He joined his compatriot Kohli in this regard. The 33-year-old, who made his T20I debut in March 2021, took 56 innings of 59 games to get the mark. Pakistan duo of Mohammad Rizwan and Babar Azam top this elite list, having taken 52 innings apiece. Decoding his T20 WC numbers SKY was impressive in his previous two T20 WC campaigns. He didn't get many chances in the 2021 edition as he managed 42 runs across three innings at a strike rate of 144.82. The 2022 edition saw him finish as the third-highest run-getter. The 33-year-old scored 239 runs across six games at 59.75. His strike rate was a stunning 189.68 (50s: 3).",

        "content": "The concept of business casual attire has significantly evolved over the years, becoming essential in many workplaces. It strikes a balance between professionalism and comfort, fostering personal expression within workplace appropriateness. This article will explore modern business casual essentials and provide practical advice for assembling a wardrobe that combines smartness with comfort, catering to the evolving workplace environment. The evolution of business casual Business casual once meant khakis and button-down shirts, but today's interpretation is far more diverse. As office cultures have shifted toward a more relaxed environment, so too has the definition of this dress code. It now includes a variety of garments and accessories that can be mixed and matched to suit individual styles while still adhering to professional standards. Essentials for every wardrobe At the core of business casual are versatile pieces perfect for transitioning from office to evening. Envision tailored blazers, crisp blouses, dark denim jeans, or chinos paired with smart loafers or ballet flats. These foundational items enable the creation of numerous outfits that epitomize professionalism while maintaining approachability. This balance is crucial for today's evolving workplace standards, making each piece invaluable. Smart comfort tips To master business casual, focus on fit and fabric—clothes should be well-fitting but not restrictive, made from materials that allow for movement and breathability. Invest in quality basics like a well-cut blazer or comfortable yet stylish shoes that can elevate any outfit. Remember to add a touch of personality through accessories like watches or statement jewelry. Seasonal adaptations To adapt your business casual wardrobe to the changing seasons, consider the art of layering. Utilize lightweight cardigans or structured vests for those in-between weather days. As temperatures rise, replace heavier materials with breathable linen or cotton blends. This strategy ensures your attire remains sophisticated regardless of the season, allowing for both comfort and a polished look without compromising on style or professional appearance. Sustainable choices matter Choose brands committed to ethical practices and durable materials for your business casual wardrobe. This supports responsible fashion and ensures your staples withstand daily wear, remaining timeless amidst trends. By prioritizing sustainability , you invest in pieces that offer both style and professional integrity, reflecting a commitment to environmental responsibility and lasting fashion sensibilities without compromising on quality or appearance.",

        "content": "Comedian Jeong Chan-woo and rapper Gil have been revealed as the companions of South Korean singer Kim Ho-joong during his hit-and-run accident. As per industry insiders quoted by The Fact , the trio was spending time at a screen golf facility and an entertainment bar in Gangnam, Seoul on May 9, the day of the incident. Notably, Kim, who had earlier denied drunk driving, admitted to it on May 19. Subsequently, he was arrested on May 24. Entertainment executive revealed details of trio's meeting An executive from an entertainment company disclosed that Jeong, a major shareholder of Kim's agency Saenggak Entertainment, shares a close relationship with Gil. After their golf meeting, the group proceeded to a restaurant for dinner and drinks, and later visited an entertainment bar where they consumed and \"mixed various alcohol.\" Saenggak Entertainment has yet to officially confirm the identities of those present due to ongoing police investigations. Every update about the case so far On the evening of May 9, around 11:40pm, the trot singer reportedly collided with a taxi in Sinsa-dong, Seoul. Per reports, the singer is alleged to have changed lanes abruptly and fled the scene post-collision. During police interrogation, Kim reportedly confessed to \"being the driver himself,\" contradicting an earlier claim made by his manager \"to be the driver.\" \"I did drink and drive. I am sorry,\" he said in a statement on the day of his arrest. Meanwhile, Kim's firm is in trouble Amid this controversy, Kim's agency, Saenggak Entertainment or Think Entertainment, is on the brink of closure due to severe financial difficulties. This has left Kakao Entertainment, a 10% stakeholder in Think Entertainment, preparing for significant losses. The agency's revenue dropped from approximately 25.6B Korean won in 2022 to around 18.8B Korean won in 2023, with cash reserves falling from 9.4B Korean won to just 1.6B Korean won over the same period. Impact of Kim's arrest on Think Entertainment Despite all the controversies surrounding Kim, the artist continued performing due to the agency's financial pressures. However, his subsequent arrest led to the cancellation of his performances and dealt a severe blow to Think Entertainment. Per reports, the agency has since announced the resignation of all employees and begun the process of closing down, offering to terminate contracts with their artists without conditions if requested.",

        "content": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A ship came under attack Tuesday in the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen, with a private security firm saying radio traffic suggested the vessel took on water after being struck. No group immediately claimed responsibility, but suspicion immediately fell on Yemen's Houthi rebels , who have launched a number of attacks targeting ships over Israel's war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Few other details were immediately available about the attack, reported by the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center. It happened off the port city of Hodeida in the southern Red Sea, near the Bab el-Mandeb Strait that links it to the Gulf of Aden. The private security firm Ambrey said the vessel reported by radio of having “sustained damage to the cargo hold and was taking on water.” It said it had been targeted in a missile attack. The location of the attack corresponded to the Marshall Islands-flagged bulk carrier Laax. The vessel reported being heading to Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates. The Laax is managed by the Grehel Ship Management of Piraeus, Greece. A man who answered the phone at Grehel declined to answer questions about the attack and an emailed request for comment was not returned. The Houthis have launched attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in recent months, demanding that Israel ends the war in Gaza , which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. The Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the United States Maritime Administration. Shipping through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden has declined because of the threat. In recent weeks, the tempo of Houthi attacks has dropped, though the rebels have claimed shooting down U.S. surveillance drones . Yemen has been wracked by conflict since the rebels seized the capital, Sanaa, in 2014. A Saudi-led coalition entered the war on the side of Yemen's exiled government in 2015, but the conflict has remained at a stalemate for years as Riyadh tries to reach a peace deal with the Houthis. Speaking Tuesday in Dubai, the prime minister of Yemen's exiled, internationally recognized government urged the world to see past the Houthis' claims of backing the Palestinians through their attacks. “The Houthis’ exploitation of a very just cause such as the cause of our people in Palestine and what is happening in Gaza is to escape the benefits of peace and lead us to major complications that exist,” Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak told the Arab Media Forum. “Peace is a strategic choice. We must reach peace. The war must stop. This is a must. Our people need security and stability. The region itself needs stability.” Jon Gambrell, The Associated Press",

        "content": "New Delhi, May 27: For those who have seen Chhaya Kadam as the railway platform feminist of 'Laapataa Ladies', Manju Mai, her glam avatars at the 77th Cannes Film Festival came as a pleasant surprise.Kadam shared the spotlight with Payal Kapadia and her fellow actors Kani Kusruti and Divya Prabha when the 'All We Imagine As Light' director received the Grand Prix, the second most important award at Cannes. The actress, who's known for her working class roles (she plays the hospital cook Parvati in 'All We Imagine As Light'), first caught the attention of fashion watchers when she attended the film's world premiere in a hand woven black pearl 'rangkat' lehenga from the atelier of Warp 'N' Weft designer Sagrika Rai. Varanasi born Rai, who has been working in Mumbai since 1987, is best known for her interpretations of the weaves of her home city. She paired Kadam's lehenga with a white shirt, black and golden striped corset top, and black blazer. In an Instagram post, the design house noted that her outfit was a captivating choice for an extraordinary event showcasing the seamless fusion of talent and craftsmanship. The Marathi actress also sported a traditional Maharashtrian 'nath' at the screening, a tribute to both her late mother and her Kanchan Kombdi character in Kunal Kemmu's 'Madgaon Express', which got widely noticed. For the awards evening, Kadam came attired in a maroon brocade saree paired with a matching full sleeved blouse. She opted for a minimal makeup look maroon lips, kohl rimmed eyes and a maroon bindi. Her hair was tied in a bun with central partition and she rounded off the look with big golden jhumkas and matching bangles.",

An expert doesn't think it's possible -- at least not anytime soon. IBT KEY POINTS JPMorgan's global market strategist said the issue on Ether's status as a security or commodity still hangs Other crypto ETFs may be approved if legislation declares that most digital assets aren't securities, he said SEC chief Gensler has already repeatedly refused to answer whether Ether is a security or not Despite growing optimism in the digital assets industry, financial services titan JPMorgan doesn't see the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for Solana (SOL) or other cryptocurrencies after the approvals for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, JPMorgan's managing director and global market strategist, told The Block Monday that the investment banking giant believes the Wall Street regulator is done approving crypto-related ETFs. \"We doubt. The decision by the SEC to approve ETH ETFs is already stretched given the ambiguity about whether Ethereum should be classified as a security or not,\" he explained. When it approved spot Ethereum ETFs last week, the SEC did not provide clarity about the main question in the crypto sector: is Ether a security or not? Ahead of the funds' approval, SEC Chair Gary Gensler once again dodged the question during an interview with CNBC's Squawk Box. He said the matter wasn't a \"fundamental question.\" However, tech firm Consensys, whose CEO is a co-founder of Ethereum, revealed late last month in a legal filing that the regulatory agency already deemed ETH as a security since last year – some days before Gensler appeared before Congress, under oath, and refused to answer directly whether Ether is a security or not. Crypto Community Hails SEC's Approval Of Spot Ether ETFs Read more Crypto Community Hails SEC's Approval Of Spot Ether ETFs Panigirtzoglou noted that the issue on Ethereum's status as a security or commodity will have a significant hold on the SEC's decision regarding other digital assets. \"We don't think the SEC would go even further by approving Solano or other token ETFs given the SEC has stronger (relative to Ethereum) opinion that tokens outside Bitcoin and Ethereum should be classified as securities,\" he said. The JPMorgan expert said if U.S. lawmakers eventually draw up and pass legislation that declare most cryptocurrencies aren't securities, the SEC may then approve SOL, the world's current fifth-largest crypto by market cap , and other crypto ETFs. No such legislation exists at this point, but it is worth noting that some policymakers have been increasingly frustrated with the financial regulator's approach towards crypto regulation. GOP Rep. John Rose of Tennessee called out the SEC for exceeding its mandate when it issued a Wells Notice on Robinhood over the latter's crypto assets arm. Representatives Mike Flood, R-Neb., and Wiley Nickel, D-N.C., have also slammed the SEC for allegedly discriminating against Bitcoin ETFs . It remains to be seen whether other crypto ETFs will be approved in the future, but without legislation that clarifies the status of most other digital assets, it appears the crypto space will have to be content with Bitcoin and Ether ETFs for now.

        "content": "Euro 2024 is not just about football on the pitch. Brands use this period of captive audience for their own benefit. Either way, as Daniel Sproul writes, there’s no escaping football fever. The summer of sport kicks off in earnest on 14 June with Euro 2024 – and brands across Europe and in the UK will be tapping into ‘football fever’. The tournament itself only lasts for four weeks. But with anticipation already building for one of the most competitive tournaments in a long time, fans and marketers’ attention will really dial up after the Uefa Champions League wraps up on 1 June, before the tournament kicks off in Munich. Essentially offering brands a six-week condensed period of activity around the tournament. Euro 2024 gives brands a valuable opportunity to reach an inflated football audience – not just ‘core’ football fans but also ‘mass-eventers’ – those who only tune in to the major tournaments. Major tournament match viewing figures feature highly in most watched programmes across the year, and I fully expect this to be the case in 2024. With potential economic benefits for the UK should England and Scotland progress, brands will also be hoping for competing nations to reach the later stages, ensuring Home Nation fan interest remains high for as long as possible. Brands will generally fall into three key categories: official tournament partners, official partners of competing nations (England and Scotland) and ‘ambush’ brands; those with no official partnerships but leveraging football hype moments through their communications and marketing. Whichever category brands fall into, there will undoubtedly be a lot of noise and clutter to cut through. So, any campaigns during this period will need to stand out in a busy marketplace. Official Uefa Euro 2024 partners have invested heavily in their associations, so expect an upweight in activity and integrated campaigns across all marketing channels, leveraging their official association and tournament IP. These brands will take a longer-term approach to their marketing activity. Lidl, for example, has already launched its new sponsorship platform, ‘We’re On Your Team’. Hellmann’s, the official BBQ partner of Euro 2024, has announced Jack Grealish as the face of their campaign, activating through the line and even creating the ultimate ‘Grealish Burger’. And official Euro 2024 partner HiSense, recently announced that Spanish goalkeeping legend Iker Casillas has joined Manuel Neuer as a brand ambassador. Partners of competing nations will lean into the excitement, passion, ambition, and national pride they share with the fans. They’ll leverage their exclusive access to key players to drive association and deliver their brand messages. We’re expecting partner activity to really kick off in early June – so keep your eyes peeled. Ambush brands will be taking a slightly different approach. While these brands won’t be able to leverage any specific tournament or team IP, we expect big brands to lead with general football creative across all comms and all channels throughout the tournament. Natural football ‘brands’ (e.g. Nike, Puma) and those who can tap into the cultural moment and fan behaviours (e.g. beer, food takeaway services) will upweight their activity during the tournament. These brands will often use high-profile ambassadors to cut through the noise, using their association with fan’s favourite players to stand out from the crowd. For example, Nike’s 2022 FIFA World cup 2022 ad and Pepsi’s recently launched 2024 ad . In the UK, linear TV is going to be an important channel for all brands to target, specifically advertising around the big matches on ITV. Every match will be broadcast on free-to-air TV which has unrivalled audience reach. And major tournament moments regularly feature in the annual top 10 most-viewed broadcasts. The Euro 2020 final between England and Italy attracted over 31m viewers in the UK . But this huge reach comes at an inflated cost. If England progress through to the semi-finals, brands should expect to pay well over £600k for a premium half time 30s ad spot. While TV advertising will predominantly focus on the key moments around big matches, brands will revert to social media for their always-on activity. Again, paid social costs are likely to be inflated during the tournament period, and brands will be competing to break through in a cluttered space. We’ll also see a lot of ‘tactical’ media spend from brands, particularly across out of home advertising (OOH) where I expect to see many brands leading with football creative across the UK’s most impactful, high-value media sites throughout the tournament – whether they are official partners, nation partners or brands tapping in to ‘football fever’. FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) brands and retailers will look to maximise points of sale – from on-pack ticket promotions to brands leveraging their partnership rights (e.g. Bud Light and England, Coca-Cola and Euro 2024) or supermarkets pushing ‘the ultimate viewing’ deals for football fans and families . Euro 2024 promises to be an exciting tournament and offers a major marketing moment for brands. Whether you are a football fan or not, there will be no escaping ‘football fever’ – I for one cannot wait! Daniel Sproul, Group Director at Fuse",

        "description": "A housewife from Kochi has exposed the dark underbelly of an organ trafficking racket. The woman, who had donated her kidney under the persuasion of the racket, faced severe abuse when she asked for the promised payment. According to a statement, the woman was tortured and sexually assaulted in a locked lodge room after she demanded the money that was agreed upon. The ordeal lasted several days. The victim was employed at the hospital now embroiled in the controversy over organ donation practices. She reportedly lost her job after raising complaints about the racket. In her statement to the TV channel, she claimed that the hospital management demanded she apologize to the organ trafficking racket to regain her employment. The woman, who donated her kidney under the racket’s persuasion, faced horrific consequences when she asked for the promised payment. Further, in an interview, the victim revealed that the perpetrator took compromising photos of her and threatened to circulate them, jeopardising her peaceful family life. Additionally, he threatened to contact her employers to ensure she lost her job. The woman recounted that when she demanded the agreed-upon payment, she was instructed to meet the perpetrator at a lodge. Upon her arrival, she found him consuming alcohol. He forced her to join him in drinking, and when she refused, he poured alcohol into her mouth. Following this, she was sexually abused. The victim, who was employed at the hospital now at the center of the organ donation controversy, lost her job after raising complaints about the racket. She claims the hospital management demanded she apologize to the organ traffickers to be reinstated. The woman, who donated her kidney under the racket’s persuasion, disclosed that the members of the racket coached her on what to tell officials to obtain permission for organ donation. She was promised Rs 8 lakhs for her kidney but received only Rs 3.5 lakhs. When she demanded the remaining amount, she faced threats, torture, and sexual assault. She recounted how the perpetrator, upon her demand for payment, lured her to a lodge where he was consuming alcohol. He forced her to drink alcohol, and when she refused, he poured it into her mouth before sexually abusing her. The perpetrator also took compromising photos of her and threatened to circulate them, jeopardising her family life and employment. He warned her that pursuing legal action would only land her in more trouble. The housewife revealed that the racket exploited her financial crisis, instructing her to lie to officials by claiming she was a close relative or domestic help of the recipient. She was trained on what to say in the hospital and police station to avoid suspicion. She mentioned knowing at least 12 other donors coerced into similar situations, noting that many poor families in her community have members with only one kidney due to financial desperation. They coach donors on what to say to officials and prepare fake documents to falsely declare the recipient as a relative. After the donor receives part of the payment before surgery, the racket evades the remaining payment, threatening that receiving the full amount would attract the authorities’ attention. In another distressing case, a 29-year-old woman from Kannur has filed a complaint against her husband and a middleman for coercing her into donating her kidney. She reported that her husband repeatedly beat and forced her to agree to the donation. The victim, fearing for her life, stated that the racket would be responsible if anything happened to her. These revelations highlight a growing and alarming trend of organ trafficking, where vulnerable individuals are most brutally exploited. The fear of “fake brain deaths” facilitating illegal organ donations further compounds public concern. This case is part of a broader issue, following recent reports of organ trafficking to Iran, and has sparked outrage and calls for a thorough investigation into the hospital’s practices and the organ donation system in Kochi. She said the kingpin of the racket is a looter.",

        "content": "The Orioles have amassed many top prospects through their rebuild. But it’s time to move on from some as the Orioles become top contenders. After the Orioles blew up their roster at the 2018 trade deadline, it was clear that they were focused on the future. Well, the future is now, and the minor league system has produced so many stars there is not enough playing time for everyone. In the infield, MVP candidate Gunnar Henderson and All-Star candidate Jordan Westburg will be joined by number-one prospect Jackson Holliday shortly. Then, there is more opportunity for time in the outfield, but many options exist. All these various options mean that one or two bad games can get you demoted or benched. Overall, there is limited opportunity for many other talented players. Let’s look at two who deserve a fair chance that may not come with the Orioles. Two Prospects The Orioles Should Move On From With the second pick in the 2020 MLB draft, the Orioles took Heston Kjerstad . A talented player out of Arkansas, Kjerstad looked primed to quickly become a key contributor for the Orioles. However, a heart issue held Kjerstad out of baseball until 2022, but when he began his career, he delivered. Before his second professional season ended, Kjerstad made his major league debut and ended up on the Orioles 2023 playoff roster. Although Kjerstad didn’t make the Orioles 2024 opening day roster, the top prospect got the call-up in late April. However, the young student has yet to deliver at the higher level. In a small sample size of 44 career at-bats, Kjerstad has an average of .205 and a .650 OPS. Also, at best, Kjerstad provides average defense, so when the bat isn’t working, the Orioles have other options they can go to. A trade for Kjerstad could be good for both sides. For the Orioles, it could free up their outfield logjam. Also, the return for Kjerstad could net the Orioles an elite reliever they desperately need. A change of scenery and a realistic path to consistent playing time could help Kjerstad blossom into stardom. Although it may seem difficult to part with a highly valued prospect, it may be the best course of action for the Orioles to take for them to take the next step. Connor Norby, the second-round pick for the Orioles in 2021, has been a minor league stud, possessing a career Batting Average of .285. Also, he has a career OPS of .861 and has hit 30 home runs since the start of the 2023 season, a lot for a primary second baseman. His numbers have been nothing short of outstanding. Despite being in Triple-A since 2022, Norby has never been called to the major league squad. That is unfortunate because Norby possesses much talent and deserves a chance. Yet, the Orioles have chosen not to waste his service time and keep him down in the minors. Also, the Orioles have Henderson and Westberg producing like All-Stars already, with Holliday and other top prospects, Coby Mayo, very soon to follow. Norby seems to have nothing left to prove in Triple-A but has no spot on the Orioles. With all of the Orioles’ talent, trading Norby at the 2024 trade deadline must happen. He is a very talented player with a lot of potential. Another Triple-A Championship would be cool for the Orioles organization, but a World Series ring is even better. Norby can help net a position of need for the Orioles, who require pitching depth. Although he could become a star, the Orioles have multiple perennial All-Stars already and need to part with their number 6 prospect. The Orioles must be active at the trade deadline for a successful postseason run. There is no reason for the Orioles to be focused on their farm system. The system has blossomed, and now they have many prospects to trade for MLB-ready guys. Kjerstad and Norby hold a lot of value and will not earn consistent playing time with the Orioles until at least 2025. They could each, in separate deals or together, help net the Orioles guys that can come in and help them potentially win the World Series 2024.

Sanada, 63, plays Lord Yoshii Toranaga, a member of the Council of Regents in 17th century Japan. A skilled military and political strategist, Toranaga is put to the test when his fellow regents look to oust him from power. With help from a shipwrecked Englishman (Cosmo Jarvis), an enigmatic translator (Anna Sawai) and an opportunistic, double-dealing lord (Tadanobu Asano), Toranaga emerges as a master chess player, allowing the action to come to him, responding accordingly and seemingly staying a step ahead of his enemies. Sanada, best known to American audiences through such movies as “The Last Samurai” (2003), “Sunshine” (2007) and “Bullet Train” (2022), infuses Toranaga with a steely stillness, patient but dynamic. He was already well familiar with the character, or at least the historical figure on whom he is based. Tokugawa Ieyasu (1543-1616) was the first shōgun of Japan’s Tokugawa shogunate, and an important figure in the country’s unification. “He was a hero from my childhood,” Sanada says by phone from New York. “He created a peaceful era for a long time after the war period. He’s still a hero in Japan, and I hope that playing him and introducing what he did will bring a very important message to the world.” So Sanada was deeply invested in “Shōgun,” which, like the 1980 miniseries before it, is based on James Clavell’s 1975 novel. And while the series tells the complete story of the novel, FX recently announced it will continue the story, with Sanada on board. But his performance as Toranaga was just the start. He has served as a historical and cultural consultant since “The Last Samurai,” in which Tom Cruise plays an embittered U.S. Army captain who travels east to train the Imperial Japanese Army (Sanada also plays the master swordsman Ujio). For “Shōgun,” created by Rachel Kondo and Justin Marks, he took his duties further, becoming a producer for the first time in his career. Where he might have hesitated to offer guidance and advice on previous projects, this time he had license to bring his considerable expertise to bear on every element of the series, from performance to language to bringing in Japanese crew members who understood the period and the style. To Sanada, the 1980 miniseries “showed feudal Japan only through blue eyes.” He had extensive conversations with Marks about not making the same mistakes. The new series uses subtitles throughout. The dense plotting assumes a level of intelligence on the audience’s part. As Sanada puts it, “We tried to put more Japanese lenses on the script. We wanted to show more details of the culture, and the characters, rules, atmosphere and everything else. That’s the biggest difference from the original ’80s series. Maybe audiences can understand easier this time.” For Sawai, who plays the key role of the translator Mariko, Sanada’s presence was a godsend. “As a person, he’s just a delight,” she says in a video interview. “He is just a very good human. But on top of that, this show would not have been this accurate, authentic and epic without Hiro. He just really led everyone.” Sanada would show up to the set on days when he wasn’t expected, “just to share his knowledge with us,” Sawai continues. “He was always there. He would go on FaceTime with me for hours on the weekend to go through my lines when I was just starting, because I wanted to make sure that I was doing the period Japanese correctly. I can’t say enough good things about him.” Born in Tokyo in 1960, Sanada found an early mentor in Sonny Chiba, the Japanese action star who started his own acting and martial arts school, Japan Action Club. Sanada signed up, and by the time he was a teenager he knew how to act, fight, sing, dance, perform stunts, ride horseback and do anything else a set or stage might require of him. He became a prolific presence in Japanese film and television, eventually even playing Tokugawa Ieyasu, the man on whom his “Shōgun” character is based, in the 1992 TV production “Oda Nobunaga.” But one of his most cherished career turning points took place on the stage. In 1999 and 2000 he played the Fool in a Royal Shakespeare Company production of “King Lear.” It was a daunting task, the most challenging English-language role of his career to that point. “Oh, my gosh, what an experience,” he recalls. “I don’t even remember opening night.” But he does remember hearing the warm laughter after his first barbed, epigrammatic zinger, and realizing that he could, in fact, do this. He was named an Honorary Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his “contribution to spreading British culture in Japan.” You can hear the pride in his voice as he recalls his “Lear” experience, which he credits with giving him the confidence to pursue “The Last Samurai” and other Hollywood movies. He has called Los Angeles home for the last 20 years. Now Sanada has reached a new plateau with “Shōgun” — and crystallized his purpose moving forward. “I hope this is going to be a big, big step into the future for me, for the industry and for Japanese artists and crew,” he says. “I hope it’s going to introduce our culture to the world.”",

        "content": "A five-year study by McLean Hospital found that binge-eating disorder persists longer than previously thought, with significant percentages of individuals still affected after 2.5 and 5 years. This challenges earlier research suggesting quicker remission and highlights the importance of continued intervention and improved treatment strategies. McLean Hospital researchers show that binge-eating disorder lasts longer than expected and relapse is common, with many still affected years after diagnosis. In the United States, binge-eating disorder is the most prevalent eating disorder. However, previous studies have presented conflicting views of the disorder’s duration and the likelihood of relapse. A new five-year study led by investigators from McLean Hospital, part of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system, revealed that 61% of individuals continued to experience symptoms of binge-eating disorder 2.5 years after being diagnosed, and 45% still exhibited symptoms after five years. These findings challenge earlier prospective studies that suggested quicker recovery times, the researchers noted. Key Findings and Implications “The big takeaway is that binge-eating disorder does improve with time, but for many people it lasts years,” said first author Kristin Javaras, DPhil, PhD, assistant psychologist in the Division of Women’s Mental Health at McLean. “As a clinician, oftentimes the clients I work with report many, many years of binge-eating disorder, which felt very discordant with studies that suggested that it was a transient disorder. It’s very important to understand how long binge-eating disorder lasts and how likely people are to relapse so that we can better provide better care.” The results were published May 28 in Psychological Medicine , published by Cambridge University Press. Disorder Characteristics and Study Methodology Binge-eating disorder, which is estimated to impact somewhere between 1 percent and 3 percent of U.S. adults, is characterized by episodes during which people feel a loss of control over their eating. The average age of onset is 25 years. While previous retrospective studies, which rely on people’s sometimes-faulty memories, have reported that binge-eating disorder lasts seven to sixteen years on average, prospective studies tracking individuals with the disorder over time have suggested that many individuals with the disorder enter remission within a much smaller timeframe—from one to two years. However, the researchers noted that most previous prospective studies had limitations, including a small sample size (<50 participants), and they were not representative because they focused only on adolescent or young-adult females, most of whom had BMIs less than 30, whereas around two-thirds of individuals with binge-eating disorder have BMIs of 30 or more. Long-Term Trends and Treatment Insights To better understand the time-course of binge-eating disorder, the researchers followed 137 adult community members with the disorder for five years. Participants, who ranged in age from 19 to 74 and had an average BMI of 36, were assessed for binge-eating disorder at the beginning of the study and re-examined 2.5 and 5 years later. After five years, most of the study participants still experienced binge-eating episodes, though many showed improvements. After 2.5 years, 61 percent of participants still met the full criteria for binge-eating disorder at the time the study was conducted, and a further 23 percent experienced clinically significant symptoms, although they were below the threshold for binge-eating disorder. After 5 years, 46 percent of participants met the full criteria and a further 33 percent experienced clinically significant but sub-threshold symptoms. Notably, 35 percent of the individuals who were in remission at the 2.5-year follow-up had relapsed to either full or sub-threshold binge-eating disorder at the 5-year follow-up. The criteria for diagnosing binge-eating disorder have changed since the study was conducted, and Javaras notes that under the new guidelines, an even larger percentage of the study’s participants would have been diagnosed with the disorder at the 2.5 and 5-year follow-ups. Javaras added that because participants in the study were community members who may or may not have been receiving treatment, rather than patients enrolled in a treatment program, the study’s results are more representative of binge-eating disorder’s natural time-course. When comparing this community sample to those in treatment studies, treatment appeared to lead to faster remission, suggesting that people with binge-eating disorders will benefit from intervention. There are major inequities in who receives treatment for eating disorders, according to Javaras. Though there was variation amongst participants in the likelihood of remission and how long it took, the researchers were unable to find any strong clinical or demographic predictors for duration of the disorder. “This suggests that no one is much less or more likely to get better than anyone else,” said Javaras. Research Directions and Future Treatment Since the study’s conclusion, the researchers have been investigating and developing treatment options for binge-eating disorder, and examining screening methods to better identify individuals who would benefit from treatment. “We are studying binge-eating disorder with neuroimaging to get a better understanding of the neurobiology involved, which could help enhance or develop new treatments,” said Javaras. “We are also examining ways to catch people earlier, because many don’t even realize they have binge-eating disorder, and there is a major need for increased awareness and screening so that intervention can begin earlier.” Reference: “The Natural Course of Binge-Eating Disorder: Findings from a Prospective, Community-Based Study of Adults” 28 May 2024, Psychological Medicine .

An EU general told The Sun: “There is a concern about the British Army . “You must have mass, you must have numbers. “In Ukraine you can see, we must have mass to fight the Russian army.” A second general, speaking on condition of anonymity, said “the British Army is still in decline”. He added: “None of the recent announcements have moved the dial on that.” PM Rishi Sunak pledged to increase defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2030. But he is standing by plans to shrink the Army to 73,000 – its smallest size for 300 years. The Sun revealed the Army’s budget is being slashed despite the PM’s promise of a £75bn boost for defence. The cuts worth hundreds of millions will fund new Tempest jets for the RAF and warships for the Royal Navy. It means plans for new air defence missiles – like Israel’s Iron Dome – will be thrown on the back burner. The MoD said the cuts were routine “budget flexing”. But it follows a warning that America can’t plug gaps in Britain’s army if the flag goes up for an all-out war. General Randy George, head of the US Army, said it would “be difficult for another army” – such as the US – to help. He said: “What I would want out of the British army? You have to have magazine depth. “Whatever formations you have, do you have all the ammunition you need to sustain yourself over a long fight?” Crucially, he added: “If you are going to come to the fight make sure you have every capability on the battlefield because it will be difficult for another army to provide that.” Major General James Martin , the head of the UK’s main war fighting division, warned his force was “less resilient” due to shortages. Asked if the Army was big enough to field a war-fighting division – a measure of Britain’s might and a core commitment to Nato – Gen Martin said: “It depends what you mean by a war-fighting division.” A division is 3,000 to 5,000 men and normally consists of three brigades. But 3rd Division, which he commands, it has been slashed just one and a half brigades. It remains Britain’s primary war fighting force designed to face a Russian equivalent. But the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank warned - before the war in Ukraine - that it was “highly likely that a Russian tank division would overmatch this much weaker British formation”. Gen Martin insisted: “By Nato standards we can put a war fighting division in the field.” But he admitted: “There are areas where it would be less resilient. That is why you have partners.” BY Kate Ferguson, Political Editor of the Sun on Sunday THE TORIES will bring back ­compulsory National Service if they win the election, Prime ­Minister Rishi Sunak has said. Every British 18-year-old man or woman will be expected to serve their country for a year under the ­proposed scheme. Teens will be able to choose between two options — a full-time placement in the Armed Forces, or volunteering with charities or civic groups at weekends. A Royal Commission will be set up to look at how to roll out the scheme. The Sun on Sunday understands those who refuse to take part will not face criminal sanctions. Mr Sunak said: “This is a great ­country but generations of young people have not had the opportunities or experience they deserve — and there are forces trying to divide our society in this uncertain world. “I have a clear plan to address this and secure our future. “I will bring in a new ­version of National Service to create a shared sense of ­purpose among our young people and a renewed sense of pride in our country.” The PM announced the radical pledge after warning the world is more dangerous now than at any point since the Cold War. Meanwhile, the Army is at its smallest size since the Napoleonic Wars 200 years ago.",

AFP KEY POINTS Most of the wallet's holdings are MAGA and MAGA VP tokens The Trump-linked wallet also has Ether holdings worth around $1.8 million An analyst has said the bank believes a second Trump admin will be 'actively supportive' of BTC A digital wallet linked to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has grown its cryptocurrency holdings to over $10 million, data from on-chain analysis firm Arkham Intelligence showed. According to Arkham, which tracks down and monitors the crypto holdings of various individuals and entities, including influential figures, the Trump-linked wallet holds various tokens, including over 1.5 million MAGA and MAGA VP tokens. The said wallet also holds a sizeable amount of Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. The account has 950,000 BABYTRUMP tokens and a staggering 20 billion CONAN tokens. BREAKING: Donald Trump now holds $10M in crypto Donald Trump’s on-chain holdings surpassed $10 Million this morning, mainly fuelled by the rise in price of the $TRUMP coin - of which Trump currently holds $7.3M. pic.twitter.com/rkQi6SLvvG — Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) May 27, 2024 While the wallet's MAGA tokens make up for the larger chunk of its overall holdings, it also has over 463 Ether, which is worth around 1.8 million. The digital wallet also holds over 12,000 USD Coins (USDC). Crypto price fluctuations have since receded, and as of Monday night, the total value of the wallet's holdings has decreased to over $9.6 million. Trump's August 2023 financial filings showed that the business magnate held Ether holdings worth up to $500,000. At the time, outlets reported that his ETH holdings were likely associated with the sale of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) he launched late in 2022 as part of his 2024 presidential bid. The ex-president, who, in the past, had been critical of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, has embraced digital assets in the lead-up to the November elections.

Jabbing the Democratic Party's leadership that has largely displayed hostility toward the digital assets industry, Trump said he will keep Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D.-Mass., and \"her goons\" from the people's Bitcoins. Earlier this month, a crypto expert expressed optimism that a second Trump administration will be supportive of BTC , the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Standard Chartered digital asset analyst Geoffrey Kendrick said the investment banking giant expects a re-elected Trump \"to be actively supportive of BTC (and digital assets more broadly) via a looser regulation and the approval of U.S. spot ETFs (exchange-traded funds).\" Interestingly, a mid-March poll by tech research investment firm Paradigm showed that 48% of digital assets owners were planning to vote for the GOP frontrunner, compared to 39% who were planning to vote for incumbent President Joe Biden. The poll further revealed that a massive 69% of American voters were dissatisfied with the current financial system and have turned to alternatives where they feel \"they have power.\" Read more Spot ETH ETF Approvals Have Become A 'Giant Political Issue': Ethereum Co-Founder Donald Trump's 2024 Campaign Team Announces It Now Accepts Crypto Donations © Copyright IBTimes 2024.

In a late Memorial Day filing on Monday, Trump's legal team urged U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon in Fort Pierce, FL, to reject the gag order motion, which would limit what he can say about law enforcement officers involved in the case. According to Reuters , the request also seeks to impose sanctions and pursue civil contempt findings against \"all government attorneys who participated in the decision to file the motion.\" The case is one of four criminal prosecutions facing Trump, wherein prosecutors have leveled 40 counts of illegally retaining sensitive national security documents after Trump's departure from office. Trump has maintained his right to retain these documents and has contested the charges against him. The prosecutors moved the petition on Friday , urging the judge to reassess Trump's bail conditions and issue an order to restrain him from making statements that could endanger law enforcement officials. Special Counsel Jack Smith argued that such a measure was necessary due to a series of \"intentionally false and inflammatory statements\" made by Trump regarding the FBI's search of his Mar-a-Lago golf resort in Florida in August 2022. Trump, who is contesting against Democratic President Joe Biden in the November 5 election, has falsely claimed in fundraising messages from his campaign that the FBI was authorized to carry out an assassination attempt. Special Counsel Jack Smith said that Trump's misrepresentations posed a threat to law enforcement officers, and claimed that restricting such comments would not impede legitimate speech. In response, Trump's lawyers, Todd Blanche and Christopher Kise, accused prosecutors of \"bad-faith behavior,\" alleging that they rushed to file the request on a Friday night before a holiday weekend without adequate consultation with the defense team, violating local court rules. The defense team argued that this violation warranted sanctions against prosecutors, potentially including covering expenses incurred as a result. Trump's lawyers argued that the gag order itself would unfairly curtail Trump's free speech rights during the election campaign. The timing of a ruling from Judge Cannon on the motions from each side remains uncertain. Meanwhile, Trump's criminal trial in New York, related to allegations of falsifying business records to conceal a hush-money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election, is set to resume with closing arguments on Tuesday. Trump also faces charges in Washington and Georgia related to attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden. Donald trump Joe biden © Copyright IBTimes 2024. All rights reserved.

Gen Martin insisted: “By Nato standards we can put a war fighting division in the field.” But he admitted: “There are areas where it would be less resilient. That is why you have partners.” BY Kate Ferguson , Political Editor of the Sun on Sunday THE TORIES will bring back ­compulsory National Service if they win the election, Prime ­Minister Rishi Sunak has said. Every British 18-year-old man or woman will be expected to serve their country for a year under the ­proposed scheme. Teens will be able to choose between two options — a full-time placement in the Armed Forces , or volunteering with charities or civic groups at weekends. A Royal Commission will be set up to look at how to roll out the scheme. The Sun on Sunday understands those who refuse to take part will not face criminal sanctions . Mr Sunak said: “This is a great ­country but generations of young people have not had the opportunities or experience they deserve — and there are forces trying to divide our society in this uncertain world. “I have a clear plan to address this and secure our future. “I will bring in a new ­version of National Service to create a shared sense of ­purpose among our young people and a renewed sense of pride in our country.” The PM announced the radical pledge after warning the world is more dangerous now than at any point since the Cold War . Meanwhile, the Army is at its smallest size since the Napoleonic Wars 200 years ago.",

        "content": "After a memorable King and Queen of the Ring, Monday Night Raw looked forward to Clash at the Castle with its May 27 episode. Becky Lynch hoped to avenge her Women's World Championship loss in a steel cage match against Liv Morgan. However, an unfortunate \"Dirty\" Dominik Mysterio interference again cost The Man. OH. MY. GOD. 😲😲😲😲😲😲😲#WWERaw pic.twitter.com/FVOnLCjtSl Gunther declared his intention to capture the World Heavyweight Championship, no matter who held the championship come SummerSlam. Both Damian Priest and Drew McIntyre made their case to hold the gold. Lyra Valkyria picked up another big win, this time defeating Kairi Sane. She is set up perfectly to challenge Morgan next. Rey Mysterio defeated Carlito but found himself at the mercy of Damian Priest once again in the never-ending rivalry with The Judgment Day. This show put an end to key storylines while pushing others forward. The following are the key takes from the night. Will Becky Lynch's steel cage match with Liv Morgan be the final match in The Man's WWE career? Fightful Select reported today that Lynch has still not been re-signed with her contract set to expire on June 1. We have the latest on Becky Lynch's WWE contract status on Fightful Select! pic.twitter.com/ecyvZcO1jN With Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins recently re-signing with WWE per Fightful Select , it is unlikely that Lynch would leave WWE and sign with another wrestling company. However, The Man has the leverage in contract negotiations to step away from wrestling for a while until WWE agrees to serious terms for a new contract. While working in WWE, her acting opportunities have been limited, but she could take major opportunities. Fightful reported that she was originally set to appear in a post-credits scene in Eternals that was cut due to its \"depressing\" tone. She will find success wherever she goes next, but WWE still needs her. She is the biggest female star WWE has ever produced and can main event any WWE show. She is arguably the best wrestler in the division. In the coming years, WWE will need her star power as well as her veteran expertise to elevate the next generation. Hopefully, for the company's sake, this is not the end. Gunther will be the challenger to the World Heavyweight Championship, come SummerSlam 2024. However, the champion remains in question. GUNTHER IS GOING TO SUMMERSLAM!#WWERaw pic.twitter.com/KcwrWWhwX1 Damian Priest holds the title going into Clash at the Castle: Scotland where he will fight Drew McIntyre. Most expected The Scottish Warrior to walk out of Clash as champion from the moment the show was announced. However, McIntyre vs. CM Punk remains the most obvious story for SummerSlam, assuming The Best in the World is healthy by that time. Damian Priest has only defended the world title once on televised programming since capturing it at WrestleMania 40. However, a successful defense at Clash at the Castle and Money in the Bank would make him a more legitimate title contender to face The King General at SummerSlam. Both men are heels at this point, but Priest is more likely to turn face by the show, especially with so much dissension in The Judgment Day ranks. Gunther vs. Priest or McIntyre are good matches, but a battle with The Punishment has more opportunity to grow naturally without delaying other big stories in WWE. Lyra Valkyria has made an immediate impact since she was drafted to Raw. She was made in the Queen of the Ring tournament and has defeated nearly everyone in her path. Even with her loss to Nia Jax, The Valkyrie has become the number two babyface on Raw over the past month. With Becky Lynch falling short against Liv Morgan once again, Valkyria should be the next woman up to challenge the Women's world champion. With Clash at the Castle: Scotland around the corner, the Irish native would likely find a friendly crowd behind her for her challenge. The timing is right, and WWE would be making a mistake delaying this challenge. Since the inception of The Judgment Day in early 2022, Rey Mysterio has been a thorn in the side of the stable. His involvement led to \"Dirty\" Dominik Mysterio joining Judgment Day and played a heavy hand in the major story beats involving the group. WWE needs to find a way to finally separate Rey and Judgment Day in a lasting fashion. His involvement has only slowed Judgment Day and especially Dirty Dom's progression recently. With Carlito seemingly joining the group, that may not happen immediately. However, WWE must find a natural place to put an end to it all. The only story left to tell is for Dirty Dom to escape the shadow of his father by defeating him definitively. Beyond that, WWE must avoid Rey's influence weighing down fresh opportunities for Judgment Day's story to evolve.",

        "description": "\"Rebel Falls\" is a historical novel based on a lesser-known fact of the Civil War: Confederate spies on the Canadian side of the Falls hoped to turn the tide in the late stages of the Civil War.",
        "content": "{{description}} Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items. CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. – Put Tim Wendel's \"Rebel Falls\" on the shelf next to \"The Falls,\" by Joyce Carol Oates, and \"The Day the Falls Stood Still,\" by Cathy Marie Buchanan. They are great Niagara novels by great Niagara-born writers. Wendel and Oates are natives of Lockport and Buchanan of Niagara Falls, Ont. That makes the Niagara River their birthright – and they write of its raging waters with prose so good you can almost feel the mist rising off the page. \"The Falls\" was published in 2004 and \"Stood Still\" in 2009. \"Rebel Falls\" is just out, and Tim is coming home next week to tell us about it. Tonight, at 6 and again at 7, he'll be at Author's Note Bookstore, on Main Street in Medina. On Thursday night, at 7, he'll be at The Place, on Elmwood Avenue. \"Rebel Falls\" ($28.95, Cornell University Press ) is a historical novel based on a lesser-known fact of the Civil War: Confederate spies on the Canadian side of the Falls hoped to turn the tide in the late stages of the Civil War. They plotted to seize a Union gunboat on Lake Erie and use it to bombard Buffalo, Cleveland, and other Great Lakes cities. If they could force the Union Army to face a Northern front, it might well demoralize Northerners and turn them against the war. Had their scheme succeeded, Tim believes Abraham Lincoln would have lost re-election in 1864. Many of the novel's characters, Lincoln included, are drawn from real life, and much of the page-turning action is grounded in historical fact. The story is sometimes told in the third person and at other times in the voice of Rory Chase, the fictional character at the center of the novel. \"Wendel's narrative is strong, emotional and driven by one of his best characters yet, a heroine with more than her fair share of grit and bravery,\" writes Ken Burns, the documentarian who knows more than a little about what he calls \"our most complicated of wars.\" Tim and his wife, Jacqueline Salmon, a fellow writer, live in Charlottesville, Va., where the Civil War still haunts. Tim was writing \"Rebel Falls\" when the so-called Unite the Right rally brought white supremacists to the city, in 2017. \"We're still, in many ways, fighting the Civil War today,\" Tim says. \"If I had written this book somewhere else it would be a different book.\" The first stop on his book tour came in Charlottesville, at the University of Virginia's Miller Center for Public Policy, where a bust of Thomas Jefferson stands sentry in the lobby. Jefferson would have appreciated the Niagara setting for Tim's novel: He had two engravings of Niagara Falls in his dining room at Monticello, where they remain on display to this day. Tim told the crowd at UVA that the idea for his novel came while reading the end notes to Doris Kearns Goodwin's \"Team Of Rivals.\" That's where he came upon a mention of the Confederate spies John Yates Beall and Bennet Burley, and their desperate plans for piracy on Lake Erie. \"Footnotes drive me crazy,\" Tim says. \"But I'm a big reader of end notes.\" He grew up in a house on the Erie Canal, in Niagara County, and had never heard about a network of Confederate spies on our borderlands. Intrigued, he set out to learn more about Beall (pronounced Bell) and Burley. Now he thinks of them as the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern of the Civil War – \"seemingly destined to make headlines,\" Tim says, \"but soon ushered into the shadows.\" Tim sought out Beall's papers and the testimony from his trial for treason – and found them at Cornell, of all places. He read Burley's file at the British Library in London. (Burley was a Scotsman who later became a noted war correspondent for the London Telegraph.) Tim's deep research – into them and into the Civil War era – undergirds the story but never slows it down. His novel moves swiftly, like the river that animates it. Cataract House, a long-gone Niagara Falls luxury hotel that was a last stop on the Underground Railroad, plays a key role in the story, as does the long-gone Suspension Bridge that once connected the U.S. and Canada near where the Whirlpool Bridge stands today. The following passage offers a feel for the flavor of \"Rebel Falls\": \"From the bridge's upper tier, the enormity of the Niagara Gorge revealed itself beneath the structure, and when crossing over the abyss the mist from the Falls often hung like a veil. When those clouds did part, the distant smoke from the factories closer to Buffalo could be seen. Off to the other side, the Niagara River flowed north past sheer cliffs until it emptied into Lake Ontario. In the early morning, mist could hug those shale-green walls like ghosts from some forgotten cemetery.\" Joyce Carol Oates writes operatically of the Falls: \"The air roars, shakes ... as if time has ceased. Time has exploded. As if you've come too near to the radiant, thrumming, mad heart of all being.\" Cathy Marie Buchanan is quieter; she calls the Falls \"that thin line that separates eternity from time.\" Their books are haunted by Niagara-style suicide. Rory Chase, too, is briefly seduced by the hypnotic pull of the Falls: \"Here the Niagara River itself accelerated, seemingly devouring everything in its path as it raced, faster and faster, for the precipice. ... The sight from the overlook was almost too much to behold. Well below me, the green-blue waters roiled and waked, and I felt as if I was stranded on a trestle and a train was bearing down on me. For an instant, I realized how easy it would be to simply step off and be done with it.\" Rory is a composite of several real-life women of the time. She insinuates herself inside the Confederate spy network – and Rory is there when the rebels try to take the U.S.S. Michigan off Sandusky, Ohio. \"If you want to know how close they came, read the book,\" Tim said the other day in a reading at Politics and Prose Bookstore, in Washington. There he was in conversation with poet E. Ethelbert Miller, who says in a blurb for the book, \"Wendel weaves a story that captures the maritime conflict as well as one in which women play a prominent role in saving our nation from itself.\" In Medina, Tim will be in conversation with author Julie Berry, who owns Author's Note Bookstore. In Buffalo, he will be in conversation with author Matt Higgins, cofounder of Buffalo, Books & Beer, the barroom reading series. (The Place is a perfect place for Tim, as it was John Hummer's favorite hangout when he played for the Buffalo Braves – and Tim and brother Chris Wendel wrote the definitive history of that doomed franchise, \"Buffalo: Home of the Braves.\" ) At the first stop on Tim's book tour, in Charlottesville, Tim was in conversation with Carol Stevens, a former managing editor for news at USA Today and metro columnist for the Courier-Express. Oh, and also my wife of almost 42 years. Author Tim Wendel and Carol Stevens, formerly of the Courier-Express and USA Today. Carol and Tim have been friends since they met at Syracuse University in the mid-1970s. Tim and I met when he interned at the Courier in the summer before his senior year. That makes Tim the only person on the planet who knew Carol and me before we knew each other. \"As Mother once told me,\" Rory Chase says in the book, \"life comes down to the company you keep.\" Be the first to know Get local news delivered to your inbox! {{description}} Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.",

        "content": "Are your health care providers trained in integrative medicine? It’s not an area of medical specialization, like gynaecology or gastroenterology. Think of it as a theory of medicine. Doctors practicing integrative medicine respect the roles of prescription drugs and surgery when the situation calls for these treatments. But they also study and embrace the potential for natural remedies, lifestyle modifications, nutrition, and traditional practices in both health promotion and disease treatment. Hippocrates, born in 460 BC, was the most influential philosopher of integrative medicine. He believed the human body should be treated as a whole, not as the sum of its parts. Benedict Lust, born in 1872 in Baden, Germany, is regarded as the “Father of Naturopathy”, a form of alternative medicine whose legitimate members promote evidence-based natural remedies. Then there is Linus Pauling. Through his research, he advanced the prevention and treatment of disease by studying how the body benefits from optimized amounts of substances which are natural to the body. Pauling was a molecular biologist. His practice of orthomolecular medicine acknowledges the body’s biochemical pathways and genetic variabilities that interact with diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer, and brain-related conditions. Dr. Andrew Saul was the founder of the Orthomolecular Medical News Service, and with his death earlier this year, we lost one of the world’s foremost advocates for evidence-based natural therapies. He made it his life’s work to pass on a wealth of knowledge, including the message that natural remedies never killed anyone. Prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs can’t make that claim. Saul practiced what he preached. His home included a garden full of vegetables, and he stressed that for a few dollars it would produce thousands of dollars of fresh produce for his family. Saul’s news service shares research papers from esteemed scientists from around the world. But it’s the simple messages that stick, and his reminders about the importance of vitamins are worthy of note. Take the 80-year-old tennis player who had to stop playing his favourite game due to severe leg cramps. He wasn’t getting oxygenated blood to his leg muscles. After taking natural vitamin E, he was back on the court. Vitamin E increases the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. This is the other reason E can stop anginal heart pain. Saul chastised dermatologists for telling patients to keep out of the sun and to use sun block. He championed the need for 3,000 to 5,000 units of vitamin D daily to decrease the risk of multiple sclerosis and maintain our sense of balance as we age. What irritated Saul the most? It was the failure of doctors to accept that vitamin C carries out so many vital health functions, and that it fights the number one killer, heart disease. He pointed to medical studies showing its effectiveness in fighting viral diseases such as pneumonia, hepatitis, meningitis, polio and even the lethal bite of a rattlesnake. He repeated over and over that no one had ever died from an overdose of vitamin C. If you take more than you body can use, it is excreted in the urine. Another fact he underscored was that the dose is so important – the greater the degree of infection the greater amounts of C needed to cure it. Saul reported that in patients desperately ill with infection, in the process of dying, one decision could save them – that is, huge doses of vitamin C, such as 300,000 milligrams administered intravenously. His final advice? Hospitals are the locus of death. So stay away, or get out of them quickly. Sign-up at www.docgiff.com to receive our weekly e-newsletter. For comments, contact-us@docgiff.com.

        "content": "The cabin of a Spirit Airlines flight from Jamaica to Florida became a scene of panic and confusion Sunday when passengers were told to prepare for a possible water landing after the aircraft was turned around due to an apparent mechanical problem, a passenger told CNN. The Airbus plane, which was headed to Fort Lauderdale, reversed course and safely returned to Montego Bay, Jamaica, “out of an abundance of caution following a suspected mechanical issue,” the airline said in a statement. The passengers were deplaned and later put on a different plane to reach their destination. The incident happened after a record-breaking start to the holiday weekend for airline travel. The Transportation Security Administration announced it set a new record for most travelers screened in a single day on Friday, according to a post from the agency on X. Passenger Bettina Rogers captured video of the plane’s takeoff in which a chiming signal can be heard twice in the cabin, though the meaning of the signal is unclear. Shortly after the signal, the pilot told passengers there was “nothing to be alarmed about,” Rogers said. About five minutes later, the pilot informed passengers the plane needed to return to the Montego Bay airport, Rogers said. But as the plane turned back, she said, the pilot announced, “Prepare for emergency water landing.” “It was scary, and people were freaking out and panicking,” Rogers said. After the flight landed safely, the cabin was full of nervous chatter and orange life vests scattered the floor and seats as passengers walked off the plane, video taken by Rogers shows. Passengers exited the plane “under normal procedures” and a new plane was arranged to take them to Fort Lauderdale, Spirit said in its statement. Rogers was able to make it safely to her destination in Atlanta. “Safety is our top priority, and the aircraft will be thoroughly evaluated by our maintenance team,” the airline said. “We apologize to our Guests for any inconvenience.” On Monday, a United Airlines flight aborted takeoff from Chicago O’Hare International Airport due to what the Federal Aviation Administration said was a reported engine fire. Also Monday, a Southwest Airlines flight from Denver to Tampa, Florida, was diverted to Colorado Springs after the flight attendants reported “a possible smell of smoke in the cabin,” according to a Southwest statement. “Southwest flight 1070 diverted safely” the airline said in a statement to CNN, apologizing for the inconvenience. “The flight crew followed established procedures, landed the aircraft and safely deplaned customers and Crew,” the statement said. said Some travelers have expressed a growing sense of unease due to a handful of harrowing aircraft accidents and as well as a string of smaller mishaps and mechanical incidents on planes – mostly Boeing jets. The midflight blowout of an Alaska Airlines plug door kicked off the year, which has also since seen several severe cases of turbulence, including on a Singapore Airlines flight from London last week that left one person dead and 71 injured. A series of less severe mishaps have also drawn the attention of travelers and air safety regulators. The Federal Aviation Administration announced in March that it’s taking a close look at United Airlines after nearly a dozen incidents on its Boeing jets, including a missing external panel, flames shooting from an engine after takeoff and a wheel popping off. Though such incidents have raised concern, aviation experts have pointed out that commercial flights remain one of the safest ways to travel in the U.S. The last major fatal commercial plane accident in the United States was in 2009, and between 2010 and 2022, there have been five commercial flight accident deaths.",

        "description": "The cost of electrification is going to be considerably higher than originally forecast, and the buildout of new generation will take much longer than expected.",
        "content": "Reaction by climate activists across New York about proposed energy policy has a common theme; they believe that fossil fuel executives are engaged in a widespread misinformation campaign about climate legislation. David P. Bauer is President & Chief Executive Officer, National Fuel Gas Company. Admittedly, I have cautioned that the “electrify everything as soon as possible” approach would jeopardize the affordability and reliability of energy in New York. Unfortunately, the facts confirm that this is very much the reality of New York energy policy. The cost of the state’s transition plan continues to increase. According to the 2021 initial plan, the incremental cost of electrification is more than $300 billion, which equates to about $40,000 per household. It’s likely these costs are significantly understated. Since 2021, the “Great Inflation” has caused construction costs to skyrocket. Last fall, citing significant cost overages, the project developers of nearly 9 gigawatts of solar/wind projects petitioned for permission to double the rates they would charge for their power. Recognizing the cost to consumers this would bring, the state denied the developers’ requests, which in turn led the developers to cancel the projects. This proceeding revealed two key facts: the cost of electrification is going to be considerably higher than originally forecast, and the buildout of new generation will take much longer than expected. With respect to reliability, the state’s plan seeks to replace natural gas-fired electric generation with intermittent wind and solar. According to the state’s data, because they are inherently unreliable, windmills and solar panels produced electricity only 25% and 13% of the time in 2022, respectively. What will generate our electricity when it’s not windy or sunny? State planners envision the roll-out of “dispatchable, emission-free resources” (DEFR), which sounds great, but according to the agency responsible for the electric grid, “DEFR technologies are not commercially viable.” It’s clear that the state aims to replace our electric generation mix with one that’s much more expensive and unquestionably less reliable, and back it up with speculative technologies that don’t exist today. The above data comes directly from Albany’s own publications and sources, all of which are listed on betterplannobans.com . I’m in favor of reducing emissions in New York in a way that’s reasonable and preserves the affordability and reliability of the energy system. Rather than going “all in” on electrification, I believe an “all of the above” emissions reduction strategy makes more sense. Through a combination of energy efficiency, selective electrification, hybrid heating solutions and deployment of low- and no- carbon fuels, we can leverage existing utility infrastructure to achieve significant decarbonization that not only meets the state’s emissions goals but also preserves access to low cost, reliable and resilient energy for New Yorkers.

        "description": "Amherst officials have given a committee until August to make a recommendation.",
        "content": "A committee tasked with creating an interpretive sign near the Confederate monument on the grounds of the Amherst County courthouse has been conducting research and is asking county officials for more time to make a recommendation. The Amherst County Board of Supervisors agreed at its May 21 meeting to extend the time frame for the monument committee to make a recommendation to August. The board in November asked that it bring forward a recommendation by this month. The committee has spent recent months researching, taking field trips to other sites and holding discussions with experts in the historical field, County Administrator Jeremy Bryant said. County staff and the committee have attended presentations at the University of Lynchburg listening to experts in history and also have consulted a professor and historian at the University of Richmond, Bryant said. A view of the Confederate monument facing toward South Main Street in the Town of Amherst. “I can tell you the monument committee is hard at work,” Bryant told supervisors. The county monument has been at the courthouse, on the historic wing facing South Main Street in the town of Amherst, for more than a century. The board said in November it decided not to alter, move or relocate the statue but develop an interpretive sign that should consider multiple viewpoints and perspectives. “I have heard nothing but good things about the work that committee is doing, nothing but good things about the way our county administrator is helping them navigate this,” Supervisor Tom Martin said. The Amherst County NAACP branch in May 2023 asked the board to address the monument, which it called an “anomaly” in a letter to supervisors, specifically wording on an accompanying plaque saying the Confederacy’s fight in the Civil War was a “noble cause.” The plaque is “out of sync with our times” and an artifact to another era that should be removed, the letter says, adding the \"noble cause\" wording is “controversial, divisive and a liability.” More than a handful of residents have addressed the board on the topic during public comments at various meetings in recent months, most voicing opposition to removing any portion of the monument. The board also has received public remarks from people who live outside the county who staunchly oppose removing or altering a statue that honors the Confederacy. The wording on the plaque on the Confederate monument outside the Amherst County Courthouse reads: “To the memory of The Sons of Amherst County, who from 1861 to 1865 upheld in arms the cause of Virginia and the South, who fell in battle or died from wounds, and survivors of the war who as long as they lived were ever proud that they had done their part in the noble cause.” All public remarks on the topic came during a general public comment period where residents can speak on any subject they choose and were not part of a public hearing designed for feedback on a specific matter. The board discussed the matter in closed session but did not give any public remarks until the Nov. 21, 2023, statement. The wording on the plaque reads: “To the memory of The Sons of Amherst County, who from 1861 to 1865 upheld in arms the cause of Virginia and the South, who fell in battle or died from wounds, and survivors of the war who as long as they lived were ever proud that they had done their part in the noble cause.” The “noble cause” wording specifically is what Amherst NAACP representatives have said they take issue with and feel the county should address.

        "description": "New East Davis Street shop combines his love for the outdoors, her love for homemade items.",
        "content": "A new store dedicated to camping and scouting has quietly been gaining attention in downtown Culpeper. The Bear and the Blade opened its location on 150 E. Davis St. in December without much fanfare. But over the first six months in operation, it has gained notice with its offerings of outdoor gear, knives and locally made items. Owned and operated by Peter and Samantha Focazio, the father and daughter team decided to open the store after he retired from the Fairfax County Police Department in 2022. The Bear and the Blade is a combination of the pair's interests: camping and the outdoors for him and her homemade items. “He lasted like six months (retired) and decided he wanted to do something,” Samantha Focazio said. “I was looking for something too, so we decided to open this up together and mix our two styles together.” She said the initial reaction to the store was confusion but it soon turned to realization, then excitement, especially when it comes to the unique selection of knives they offer. “Our mission is to offer the best quality merchandise at affordable prices,” said Peter Focazio. “As an avid outdoorsman, we help people find the right products for their specific needs. We strive to make the buying experience as enjoyable as possible. This approach has allowed us to build a base of friends, not just customers.” The Bear and the Blade may have come at the right time, according to the Peter Focazio. Just as they were coming into the downtown area, a similar store, Romano Outdoors, moved to a new location on Recreation Road, adding an archery range. This left their business as the only downtown store providing outdoor equipment selections, he said. The store also offers Charlie Bears — handmade, stuffed animals with five points of articulation made in the United Kingdom. Due to the unique faces of each bear, they earned the nickname of “bears with personalities.\" According to Peter Focazio, the Bear and the Knife is only one of four stores in Virginia that sells the stuffed bears. The store is planning to hold a Father's Day sale. Peter Focazio said there had been a large demand for automatic knives, and this is his way of showing he listened to his customer base.

        "description": "Taking stock of the best starting nines after two months of the 2024 MLB season.",
        "content": "The 2024 MLB season is two months old. Among other things, it's a good excuse to engage in some stock-taking exercises. For instance, ranking all 30 starting lineups in the league. First, understand that \"lineup\" is not the same as \"offense.\" Though batting and baserunning are all that matter here, we're only talking about teams' go-to starting nines, as catalogued by RosterResource . Second, we're talking about what teams have right now . Whether to credit teams for the contributions they've received from injured players—most notably Ronald Acuña Jr. and Mike Trout—was a tricky question, but it ultimately seemed best to consider what clubs actually have rather than what they should have. In any case, let's count 'em down one at a time. Note: All stats are current through play on Sunday, May 26. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 25 HR, 16 SB, .232 AVG, .295 OBP, .350 SLG, 84 wRC+ What's Good Thank goodness for Pham, who's hit .315 with a trio of home runs and stolen bases since he joined the White Sox on April 26. It's also nice to see DeJong having a rebound year. His OPS is up 110 points from 2023, and he leads the team with seven homers. What's Bad The Benintendi signing just keeps looking worse, as he's now a .242/.301/.333 hitter as a White Sox. And sans Luis Robert Jr., Eloy Jiménez and Yoán Moncada, what was always going to be a weak lineup is now one that couldn't punch its way out of a wet paper bag. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 38 HR, 24 SB, .231 AVG, .285 OBP, .356 SLG, 83 wRC+ What's Good Chisholm and De La Cruz are having solid seasons, most notably in how they own 37 percent of the Marlins' 43 home runs. And keep an eye on Sánchez as a candidate to get hot. He doesn't have much to show for it, but he's crushing balls at a team-best average of 94.2 mph . What's Bad Let's not simply ignore that this lineup is missing Luis Arraez, nor that he's hit .391 since leaving Miami for San Diego. Anderson, meanwhile, seems cooked as a star. In 41 games, he's batting only .206 with three extra-base hits and six walks. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 32 HR, 23 SB, .261 AVG, .324 OBP, .399 SLG, 92 wRC+ What's Good McMahon is having a career year by way of an .877 OPS and 10 long balls. And along with Tovar and Díaz, he's one of three Rockies regulars who are hitting in the vicinity of .300. Tovar is also turning on the power with a .525 slugging percentage in May. What's Bad Because they're making a combined $41 million, manager Bud Black doesn't have much choice but to keep putting Blackmon and Bryant in the lineup. But those at-bats are largely going to waste, as the two veterans have a total of two homers and combined .616 OPS . Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 40 HR, 56 SB, .220 AVG, .293 OBP, .372 SLG, 90 wRC+ What's Good As four of these nine guys have at least five home runs and five stolen bases, there's a decent power-speed balance at play in the Nationals' lineup. With eight of each, Abrams has a shot at the team's first 25-25 season since 2006. What's Bad Then again, Abrams is but one of seven guys who have really hit the skids in May. He, Gallo, Senzel and Ruiz are hitting just .212 with three home runs this month, and that lack of productivity has been especially felt as the Nats have lost 10 of their last 14 games. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 40 HR, 65 SB, .230 AVG, .319 OBP, .392 SLG, 100 wRC+ What's Good As he has 31 just on his own, you can thank De La Cruz for about half of those stolen bases. Likewise, he leads the Reds with nine homers and is generally just super-duper exciting. And for his part, Stephenson is bouncing back by hitting .323 over his last 17 games. Elly knows hustle ⚡️@ellylacocoa18 pic.twitter.com/iSHmzxhoXa What's Bad It's been a rough month for everyone here, and arguably De La Cruz most of all. He's gotten on base at a .292 clip and gone deep only once. This is a major issue for a lineup that was perilously shallow to begin with. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 34 HR, 15 SB, .240 AVG, .313 OBP, .385 SLG, 99 wRC+ What's Good That front four? It's pretty good. Not one of those guys has a wRC+ below 118, and Carpenter and Greene further account for half of this starting nine's 34 long balls. Pérez has been a pleasant surprise lately, putting up an .818 OPS in 23 games since April 28. What's Bad After seeming to find his stride amid a 31-homer breakout in 2023, Torkelson is back to struggling again. The 2020 No. 1 pick's OPS has dropped 114 points. It's otherwise time to consider moving on from Báez, who's been helpless with a .506 OPS and one homer. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 45 HR, 30 SB, .251 AVG, .307 OBP, .416 SLG, 103 wRC+ What's Good Adell's post-hype breakout is ongoing and plenty of fun, though he still needs one more homer to match Ward for the team lead with 11. And hitters don't come much hotter than Rengifo, who's hit safely in 14 of his last 16 games. What's Bad With Mike Trout, Anthony Rendon and Brandon Drury sidelined with injuries, the Angels' lineup is well short of being at full capacity. And from looking at his .656 OPS, it's fair to question if they did right by Schanuel in promoting him so soon after the 2023 draft. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 32 HR, 41 SB, .234 AVG, .320 OBP, .360 SLG, 102 wRC+ What's Good Paredes is having a dandy season, batting .301 with nine homers. And after both were ice-cold through April, Díaz and Arozarena have come around in May. The former has hit .286, while the latter has made his 14 hits count. Those include five homers and four doubles. What's Bad More power is always welcome, but Arozarena is still hitting only .156. Lowe is likewise batting in the .150s, and even guys who are having good years (i.e., Rortvedt and Palacios) don't scare anyone. Ultimately, it's a thinner lineup than the one the Rays had last year. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 46 HR, 38 SB, .243 AVG, .310 OBP, .409 SLG, 99 wRC+ What's Good Witt and Perez are among the most productive batsmen in MLB right now, as both are hitting over .300 with nine homers apiece. As Witt also has 16 stolen bases, he has a real shot at a second straight 30-30 season. Garcia, meanwhile, is hitting .313 in May. What's Bad A couple of good individual pieces does not make a good lineup. And this one has more than its share of nothing hitters. Melendez and Renfroe are both batting under .200, and Pasquantino, Velázquez, Frazier and Isbel aren't far above that mark. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 37 HR, 23 SB, .249 AVG, .319 OBP, .382 SLG, 104 wRC+ What's Good That Burleson, who's only 25, and Winn, who's only 22, are both batting over .300 is a great sign for the Cardinals. They're also seeing signs of life from Nootbaar and Gorman in May, wherein they've teamed up for an .899 OPS after posting a .618 OPS in April. What's Bad Age has come for Goldschmidt (36) and Arenado (33), and it's come hard. Whereas it was .937 just two years ago, their collective OPS is now just .659 . It also really hurt to lose Willson Contreras to that broken arm , as he had been St. Louis' best hitter to the tune of a .950 OPS. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 46 HR, 27 SB, .239 AVG, .311 OBP, .390 SLG, 105 wRC+ What's Good Moore has been thoroughly on one lately, batting .310 with a 1.095 OPS over his last 18 games. Which is good, because Seattle needed another hitter to step up and help Raleigh carry the lineup. Albeit with only a .729 OPS, he's done so with 11 homers. Cal Raleigh comes through with a pinch-hit go-ahead grand slam!(MLB x @DairyQueen) pic.twitter.com/xAYaSAolBO What's Bad Rodríguez is no stranger to slow starts, but even homers in back-to-back games only raised his OPS to .645. The Mariners need more from him, but also from Crawford, Polanco and Mitch Garver. And as nice as the homers are, Raleigh's 35.5 strikeout rate is not so nice. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 39 HR, 20 SB, .244 AVG, .318 OBP, .397 SLG, 104 wRC+ What's Good Two-thirds of these guys are rocking a wRC+ above the league-average delimiter of 100, with five of them also boasting at least five homers. Cruz has been going off in May, gathering four of his seven homers while scorching the ball at an average of 99.0 mph . What's Bad Of course, Cruz is also sporting a 35.1 strikeout percentage. The Bucs are also without Ke'Bryan Hayes because of back inflammation , and this is the second year in a row that Reynolds hasn't been a difference-maker. Not counting 2020, his .763 OPS is a career low. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 42 HR, 21 SB, .246 AVG, .317 OBP, .396 SLG, 104 wRC+ What's Good Marte's knack for hitting streaks is very much alive, as he followed last year's 18-game sequence in the playoffs with a 21-game run this year. He and Walker also have 10 homers apiece, while Pederson has been a righty masher with an .897 OPS against them. What's Bad Those three guys need more help carrying Arizona's lineup, and they're just not getting it from Carroll, Gurriel or Suárez. The latter two have been ice-cold in May, while Carroll has basically failed to launch in hitting .188 with two homers. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 50 HR, 16 SB, .239 AVG, .303 OBP, .426 SLG, 111 wRC+ What's Good If these numbers took you by surprise, well, you're likely not alone in just now learning Oakland's lineup was this solid. Rooker and Langeliers can each claim credit for 11 of those 50 homers, while Bleday is enjoying a breakout with an .844 OPS and five long balls in May. What's Bad Rooker, Gelof and Brown are all striking out in more than 30 percent of their plate appearances. As there are also four OBPs under .300 among this lot, it's fair to say volatility is the name of the game when the A's are at bat. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 38 HR, 11 SB, .256 AVG, .326 OBP, .420 SLG, 117 wRC+ What's Good This lineup may not read like the next coming of the Murderers' Row, but it has a 127 wRC+ in May. Wade and Chapman have been hot, and the Giants have also gotten boosts from Wisely, who's hitting .438, and Matos, who got NL Player of the Week honors last week. What's Bad With Jung Hoo Lee and Michael Conforto out with injuries, the success this lineup is enjoying doesn't feel sustainable. The Giants especially need more from Soler, but that's contingent on him conquering Oracle Park. He has a .539 OPS and two homers there. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 50 HR, 39 SB, .238 AVG, .319 OBP, .407 SLG, 108 wRC+ What's Good Ramírez had been cool, but not anymore now that he boasts a 1.154 OPS and 10 homers over his last 20 games. And the Guardians may have something in Fry, whose 1.087 OPS is supported by an 18.5 walk rate and 90.1 mph average exit velocity. José forever. #ForTheLand pic.twitter.com/7F6S3S6MIz What's Bad If it wasn't for Ramírez and Fry, Cleveland's lineup would be having a rough go of it in May. Whereas the two of them have a 1.098 OPS for this month, the other seven guys are at .625 collectively. The Naylor brothers are especially struggling, accounting for a .589 OPS . Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 43 HR, 22 SB, .233 AVG, .321 OBP, .384 SLG, 104 wRC+ What's Good Only three members of this lineup are below the 100 wRC+ threshold, and that list includes the team leader for home runs (Morel) and a two-time All-Star (Swanson). And keep an eye on Hoerner, who has an .831 OPS with more walks than strikeouts in May. What's Bad That Tauchman has been the Cubs' best hitter is a nice surprise, but not exactly the plan. This is generally a lineup still searching for its peak, and it likely won't come until Bellinger and Suzuki join Swanson in living up to their full potential. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 46 HR, 30 SB, .238 AVG, .310 OBP, .383 SLG, 104 wRC+ What's Good With five of the nine landing above the 100 wRC+ mark, there are more good hitters than bad hitters in this lineup. Nimmo's .356 OBP is enough to make up for his .217 average, while Alonso has unsurprisingly supplied the power. He's hit five more homers than any other Met. What's Bad Lindor has threatened to break out, but he's yet to sustain anything in running his OPS to a career-low .646. This is also shaping up to be another post-prime year for McNeil, and Baty is only making incremental progress in living up to his former status as an elite prospect. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 42 HR, 34 SB, .254 AVG, .321 OBP, .439 SLG, 109 wRC+ What's Good The top half of the Red Sox lineup is rock-solid. Wong is hitting .333, while Duran, Abreu and Devers have a combined .876 OPS with 12 homers (seven of which belong to Devers) in May. And a fun fact about Rafaela: His 18 RBI from the No. 9 spot are the most in MLB . What's Bad Triston Casas, who's out with a rib injury , is sorely missed in the middle of this lineup. His absence is especially apparent while O'Neill struggles in May, hitting only .151 with a 43.9 strikeout percentage. Until he breaks out, things are rough in those Nos. 5-8 spots. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 40 HR, 25 SB, .244 AVG, .320 OBP, .396 SLG, 107 wRC+ What's Good With a .314 average and .999 OPS, Jansen has low-key been one of MLB's top hitters since he came off the IL in mid-April. And now Bichette and especially Guerrero are coming around in May. The former is hitting .293 this month, while the latter's average is a sparkling .407. HERE 💥 COMES 💥 VLADDY 💥 #PLAKATA pic.twitter.com/T3GbBLLecJ What's Bad On the other hand, Turner, Varsho and Springer are all batting in the .100s this month. And after beginning his career hitting like Babe Ruth , Schneider has also cooled with a .232 average and .739 OPS since April 14. The big picture is of a lineup that's struggling to click. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 46 HR, 10 SB, .256 AVG, .319 OBP, .425 SLG, 111 wRC+ What's Good Ozuna, at least, is still swinging like it's 2023. He's hitting .311 with 15 home runs. Olson has the exact same hard-hit rate as Ozuna, and it's beginning to show by way of an .800 OPS for the month of May. What's Bad Disappointment was hanging over this lineup even before Sunday. And now that Ronald Acuña Jr. is out with a torn ACL , it'll take a lot for the vibes to get better. Riley especially needs to get his bat going, but Albies and Harris deserve just as much scrutiny. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 51 HR, 17 SB, .250 AVG, .322 OBP, .404 SLG, 105 wRC+ What's Good With 12 homers and 37 RBI, García is still a run-production machine. And now Seager is again as well, as his OPS is 372 points higher in May than it was in April. Yet even his OBP still hasn't caught up to those of Smith and Lowe, who lead the Rangers at .376 and .371. What's Bad The Carter breakout that was promised in 2023 hasn't come to fruition, as he only has a .633 OPS. And after a warm April, Semien has come back down to earth in getting on base at just a .292 clip in May. These are but two aspects of the team's offensive sputter this month. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 44 HR, 17 SB, .252 AVG, .325 OBP, .443 SLG, 120 wRC+ What's Good There are six regulars in this lineup who boast at least a 110 wRC+ , and the best doesn't even belong to Jeffers despite his .868 OPS and 10 homers. It belongs to Kepler, who's been hotter (1.026 OPS) than even Correa (.879 OPS) amid an otherwise cool May for this lineup. What's Bad The Twins have been without Royce Lewis, who boasts a .313 average and .933 OPS in 71 career games, since Opening Day because of a quad strain . And poor Julien is in a dreadful slump in which he's hit only .143 with one extra-base hit in 25 games since April 28. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 43 HR, 35 SB, .266 AVG, .337 OBP, .405 SLG, 120 wRC+ What's Good Arraez has been as advertised as he's hit .391 as a Padre. They also have another .300 hitter in Profar, who's pitched in seven homers to go with the 17 that have come from Tatis and Cronenworth. The latter notably needs only two more homers to match his 2023 total. What's Bad Xander Bogaerts wasn't doing much before he fractured his shoulder , but it's another reason why Machado needs to pick it up. He's batting just .235 with a .653 OPS. The shine has otherwise worn off Merrill, who's hit only .225 since getting his average to .329 on April 23. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 44 HR, 61 SB, .266 AVG, .343 OBP, .427 SLG, 121 wRC+ What's Good Between Turang, Contreras and Yelich, the Brewers are the only team in MLB with three regulars batting over .300. There's also a considerable amount of speed in this lineup, as Contreras and Ortiz are the only ones who don't have at least five stolen bases. 🚨 CHRISTIAN YELICH STEALS HOME 🚨 pic.twitter.com/0682X3EZpR What's Bad The only true weaknesses here are in the bottom three spots. That's especially a shame regarding Frelich and Chourio, who are both former top prospects. Though Chourio has done well to cut down on strikeouts in May, it hasn't resulted in a boost in production. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 59 HR, 31 SB, .269 AVG, .340 OBP, .438 SLG, 123 wRC+ What's Good It's an oddity that the Astros are scoring only 4.6 runs per game. This lineup has a bit of everything, from the MLB home run leader (Tucker) to two more hot-hitting established stars (Altuve and Alvarez) to a .320 hitter (Peña). In fact, it's not missing much. What's Bad Except, of course, for the vintage version of Bregman. He's been better in May, but his OPS is still down 203 points from 2023. This year has also been a step back for Diaz and McCormick, and the downfall of José Abreu has opened a gaping hole at first base. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 56 HR, 43 SB, .259 AVG, .338 OBP, .426 SLG, 118 wRC+ What's Good With a .923 OPS and 13 homers, Harper is having another spectacular season for the Phillies. Yet he's also but one of seven regulars with at least a 116 wRC+ . Bohm and Sosa are batting over .300, while Stott and Rojas have been pests on the bases with 24 total steals. What's Bad Trea Turner is still out with a strained hamstring , but really the only other pain point for the Phillies concerns Castellanos' enduring slump. He's been better in May than he was in April, but we're only talking a .665 OPS vs. a .521 OPS. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 54 HR, 29 SB, .275 AVG, .350 OBP, .458 SLG, 133 wRC+ What's Good As each is hitting over .330 and their combined OPS is one point shy of 1.000, the Betts-Ohtani duo is the best in the National League. Freeman, Smith and Teoscar Hernández are in the .800 OPS range, and the latter is just one homer short of Ohtani for the team lead. What's Bad This is undeniably a top-heavy lineup, as not one of the four hitters in the back half is even close to a 100 wRC+ . And even Betts and Ohtani are slumping right now, with the latter going just 7-for-32 in eight games amid a battle with a bruised hamstring . Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 73 HR, 25 SB, .259 AVG, .338 OBP, .447 SLG, 125 wRC+ What's Good We all figured Soto and Judge would be dangerous, but seeing them with a combined 1.008 OPS and 31 homers still boggles the mind. Stanton is a third power source with 13 homers, while Torres (speed) and Verdugo (contact) balance the general skill set of this starting nine What's Bad The top third of this lineup is basically above reproach, but not the other two-thirds. Stanton has nothing besides power to offer, and anything the Yankees get from the bottom four slots is a bonus. The best wRC+ for that bunch is a mere 102 belonging to Rizzo. Go-To Lineup Collective Stats: 73 HR, 39 SB, .256 AVG, .320 OBP, .473 SLG, 125 wRC+ What's Good Here's a lineup in which only Mateo doesn't have at least six homers and only Mullins has a wRC+ below 100, and they at least have 21 total steals. There are otherwise five guys above the 130 wRC+ threshold, including Henderson with his 17 homers. \"Loaded\" comes to mind. This is a scheduled post. pic.twitter.com/Jy2Xvs2HHh What's Bad As he's only a .222 hitter over the last two seasons, the version of Mullins who went for a 30-30 season in 2022 is nowhere to be found. It's also been a tough year for Santander, and especially lately as he's hit only .183 in May. Stats courtesy of Baseball Reference , FanGraphs and Baseball Savant .",

        "content": "Fremantle coach Justin Longmuir has defended the form of under-fire two-time Brownlow medallist Nat Fyfe amid criticism over his defensive work and ball use. Fyfe was put on notice by AFL analyst Kane Cornes who highlighted players beating him on the spread away from contests, particularly Collingwood’s Jack Crisp in Friday night’s draw. And the former Dockers captain’s ball use has also come in for criticism in recent weeks. In an interview with 7NEWS, Longmuir pointed to Fyfe’s outstanding 37-disposal performance to help beat the Western Bulldogs just weeks ago and believes he is not too far removed from that kind of form. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. “I don’t think it’s as bad as everyone is saying,” he said. “Four or five weeks ago against the Western Bulldogs he had his best game in three or four years and we are not far away from that. “He has probably been a little bit indecisive with the ball at times, but a lot of his game is in good order and I’m really confident he can bounce back.” It comes as the Dockers prepare to face a firing Melbourne midfield headlined by the explosive Christian Petracca. Cornes went as far as to say Fremantle’s midfield is better without Fyfe in an explosive assessment at the weekend. Kane Cornes has put dual-Brownlow medallist Nat Fyfe under the blowtorch and declared Walyalup (Fremantle) are a better midfield when he isn’t playing. “I think Fremantle are at their best when there is speed on the ball. The amount of time in transition or when his direct opponent (gets the ball and) Fyfe is burnt,” he told the Sunday Footy Show. “He only had 20 touches and one effective kick. His kicking is an issue. Fyfe is great in the phone box but when it gets outside of the phone box, look at the explosion from the Collingwood players. I think they’re a better midfield when he’s not in the side.” Longmuir lamented their ball movement in the draw, particularly in a goalless third quarter that opened the gate for Collingwood to storm back into the game. “I wasn’t happy with our ball movement. I thought we over-used the handball, didn’t trust ourselves — especially in that third quarter — to go at the game with our handball and that probably caused the over-handball and really fuelled their pressure,” he said. “There were times where we didn’t look to take field position and play with the right intent, but it was only one of our issues.” Michael Frederick “still has a few boxes to tick” and will be assessed after Fremantle’s main training later this week in his push to recover from a concussion in time to face the Demons on Sunday.",

        "content": "A wise man once said, \"If you ain't first, you're last.\" Professional football tends to be a bottom-line business, particularly when a franchise reaches a point where it can't seem to break the glass ceiling to claim the game's ultimate prize. Everyone in the NFL is laser-focused on winning a Super Bowl and building their legacy. \"I don't see bust. I see Super Bowl,\" Detroit Lions head coach Dan Campbell told reporters Thursday when asked if it's \"Super Bowl or bust\" for his squad this season. \"I don't know what bust is.\" But it's a process. Every organization finds itself in varying stages. Some teams are rebuilding. Others are fringe playoff teams. A select few are true contenders on a yearly basis. At that crucial point, the NFL turns into a zero-sum game. Eventually, a team must find a way to topple the giant—in this case, the back-to-back champs, the Kansas City Chiefs—or go in a different direction. The latter option can be difficult to swallow but some teams reach a point where they're good but not quite good enough. The following five squads find themselves on the edge, with the potential to win it all. If not, expect significant changes. The Buffalo Bills have been, arguably, the most talented NFL team for at least the last four years. They've made it to the AFC Championship Game once, while being bounced from the postseason by the Kansas City Chiefs on three different occasions. General manager Brandon Beane already began a soft reset this offseason. As the Bills roster started to get a little older, the organization decided to release veterans Mitch Morse, Jordan Poyer and Tre'Davious White. To be fair, Morse and Poyer are both 32 or older, while White only played in only 10 games over the last two seasons because of injury. But each was a key component to what Buffalo built under the supervision of head coach Sean McDermott. Also, the organization traded its No. 1 wide receiver, Stefon Diggs (and a couple late-round draft selections), to the Houston Texans for a 2025 second-round pick. Quarterback Josh Allen remains the key, of course. He's a legitimate MVP-caliber candidate, but things will be a little different around the franchise player this fall. Despite that turnover, the biggest issue toward actually winning the franchise's first Super Bowl isn't the roster. The Bills still have a lineup good enough to rank among the AFC's best and find their way into the Big Game. However, there are those around the league who view McDermott as the primary stumbling block. The onus is placed on the coach's \"tight\" demeanor and inability to take the blame. \"This job's too hard to fight from within and that's what you do there,\" one former Bills assistant told Go Long's Ty Dunne . \"You're fighting against the head coach. You've got to overcome the head coach. This job is already hard enough. You've got to overcome all your opponents, all the dynamics. You've got to overcome so much s--t. But then you've got to overcome the guy who's supposedly steering the boat.\" Another early playoff exit will almost surely signal the end of McDermott's tenure, with Beane possibly following. The Cleveland Browns feature a two-time winner of the NFL Coach of the Year, the reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year and the biggest guaranteed contract in league history. These aren't the same old Browns, and they haven't been for some time. Expectations have been built by a winning record over the last four seasons. Strangely, Kevin Stefanski's individual recognition isn't necessarily based on his team emerging as a dominant squad. Instead, Cleveland outperformed previous expectations in both of those instances either due to a previous regime's failures or injuries. Those awards shouldn't be viewed as a safety net. Owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam went out and sank a fully guaranteed $230 million contract into quarterback Deshaun Watson. So far, his tenure with the team has been a complete failure through two seasons, be it because of suspension, rust or injuries. The three-time Pro Bowler was brought in to finally give the Browns a franchise quarterback. The organization paid an exorbitant price to acquire his services. Stefanski even retooled nearly the entirety of his offensive staff this offseason in hopes of maximizing what the team has behind center. In doing so, he's dismissed all three of his initial coordinator hires over the past two offseasons. Yet the 28-year-old old quarterback is entering Year 4 since anyone could consider him a viable starter. The Browns are a team that wants to be taken seriously, with a need to win a championship. Top talent can be found among every single position group. Running back Nick Chubb (when healthy), wide receiver Amari Cooper, tight end David Njoku, guards Joel Bitonio and Wyatt Teller, edge Myles Garrett, linebacker Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah and cornerback Denzel Ward are all Pro Bowl/All-Pro-caliber performers. At this point, it's all about the quarterback in Cleveland. If Stefanski and his staff can't maximize what they have behind center, either they or the quarterback shouldn't be with the team beyond this season. The Haslams aren't exactly known for their patience. The Dallas Cowboys' lack of urgency this offseason screams incompetence. Despite owner Jerry Jones saying the organization was \" all in \" multiple times over the last few months, the Cowboys have done next to nothing to improve their roster. What's the old saying? Oh, yeah. \"If you're not getting better, you're getting worse.\" At 12-5, Dallas finished tied for the NFC's best regular-season record. Since that point, the Cowboys... The final point is extremely important, because a clean slate may be the way to go for the Cowboys if they fall short yet again. Head coach Mike McCarthy and his staff are almost certainly gone if Dallas disappoints. Prescott, 30, is also considering the possibility of walking as well: \"I allow that to the business people to say what it's worth. What they're supposed to give a quarterback of my play, a person of my play and a leader of my play. For me, it's about control what I can control and handle that part. The rest will take care of itself. I don't play for money. Never have never cared for it to be honest with you.\" The amazing part about how Dallas operates is the front office appears to be the only one in professional football not capable of massaging the salary cap with void years or roster bonuses or multiple other ways to make the numbers work in its favor. Instead, the Cowboys have had to surrender quality players or move some because difficult salary situations. Prescott is the starting point. An offer should already be on the table, because he's a legitimate top-10 quarterback. If that doesn't get done, the Cowboys might as well consider a full reset. The New York Jets, more than any other team in recent memory, are all-in for one season and one season only. Everything is built around 40-year-old quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who is coming off a season-ending ruptured Achilles tendon. In order to build around the four-time NFL MVP, the team brought in veteran offensive tackles Tyron Smith and Morgan Moses—both of whom are 33 years old. Plus, the organization didn't commit long-term to wide Mike Williams since he signed a one-year deal this offseason. If healthy, the Jets do have the pieces in place to compete at a high level. Rodgers doesn't need to be an MVP candidate, not with running back Breece Hall, wide receiver Garrett Wilson and a much-improved offensive line (at least on paper). The veteran signal-caller isn't shying away from building expectations, either. \"I'm always confident, you know me, I feel like if I'm on the field and doing what I'm capable of doing No. 1, we've always got a chance,\" he told Mad Dog Sports Radio . \"And No. 2, more than that, we're one of those, you know, half dozen to 10 teams that can win a championship this year. So that's what's exciting.\" Furthermore, New York fields a top-three defense. Obviously, Rodgers' injury after only four snaps with his new team tanked the 2023 campaign. His presence alone changes the math, but a potential championship window is only cracked open. It'll be slammed shut here shortly. In order for New York to thread the needle, it must overcome the Buffalo Bills and Miami Dolphins in its own division, then outpace whichever squad emerges from the brutal AFC North, possibly be forced to turn back an ascending C.J. Stroud and the Houston Texans, then find a way to stop the Kansas City Chiefs. The odds aren't in the Jets' favor. There's no reason to mess around with Rodgers for another season if things don't work out perfectly. Head coach Robert Saleh will have five mediocre years under his belt. General manager Joe Douglas is already on his second head coach. It's all or nothing for this group. A little over 15 months ago, the Philadelphia Eagles played in Super Bowl LVII, which they lost to the Kansas City Chiefs. Unless something drastically changes during the upcoming season, the Eagles may need a major shift in direction. The Eagles took a step back in 2023 after losing offensive and defensive coordinators Shane Steichen and Jonathan Gannon to become the Indianapolis Colts and Arizona Cardinals head coaches, respectively. Neither of their replacements lasted beyond the 2024 campaign, with Sean Desai being quietly stripped of defensive playing-calling duties during the season. Philadelphia head coach Nick Sirianni didn't skimp on his next coordinator hires, with two high-profile additions in Kellen Moore and Vic Fangio. \"We know those are really good coaches,\" Sirianni told reporters at the NFL Scouting Combine. \"Have a lot of faith in them. It's the meshing of two systems to grow in both systems and put the best product on the field. That's why that's kind of stayed similar because we're going to be doing different things, but we're also going to be doing things we're successful at.\" At the same time, no built-in excuses exist anymore. Moore and Fangio are well-regarded. The Eagles still field one of the game's best rosters, even with the retirements of Jason Kelce and Fletcher Cox. General manager Howie Roseman upgraded the lineup among the secondary, with the first- and second-round additions of Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean, as well as Saquon Barkley's inclusion to the backfield. This team shouldn't have finished its previous season by losing six of its last seven games, including a one-sided playoff meeting with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Eagles are fully capable of a bounce-back season to get right back into the thick of where they were about halfway through the 2023 campaign. After all, the NFC is considered the weaker of the two conferences. But if Sirianni's squad continues to falter, a Super Bowl appearance two seasons prior shouldn't be enough to keep everything intact.",

        "content": "COLCHESTER'S outgoing MP has been revealed as the new chair of a group which is calling for improvements to the A12 and A120. Will Quince has been appointed the new chair of Transport East, succeeding Stanway councillor Kevin Bentley. Mr Quince, who has confirmed he will not stand for re-election, emerged as the successor in a \"competitive selection process\". His appointment underwent evaluation by the Government's Advisory Committee on business appointments. Transport East's objectives include progressing investment in the A120 west at Stansted, through Braintree, via the A12 to Colchester and then to Harwich and Clacton. The group, which was launched in 2018 under the leadership of Mr Bentley, provides important data and strategies to businesses and the central government to reduce carbon emissions in transport and improve across to the region's ports and airports. Mr Quince said: \"It’s a privilege to be selected as chair of Transport East. \"Since 2018, the organisation has grown in impact and has several notable successes including receiving endorsement from Government for its regional transport strategy, making the case for much-needed investment in the East’s rail and road networks and advocating the region’s role in the nation’s prosperity. \"I look forward to working with the Transport East Forum and team to continue driving the fantastic progress made so far. There’s much to celebrate about the East and the people who live and work here, and ensuring they are well-connected through sustainable transport is vital to the long-term success of the region.\" Andrew Summers, chief executive of Transport East, said: \"I’d like to welcome Will to Transport East. His knowledge and passion for the region will be instrumental to supporting Transport East and our partners improve transport connections and investment in local areas. \"Transport East has demonstrated its value regionally and nationally since launching in 2018 by advocating for investment, providing tools and evidence to local authorities and being a national centre of excellence in rural mobility. I look forward to working with Will to further enhance our role as the East’s sub-national transport body.\"",

        "content": "April showers bring May flowers, and a lot of Major League Baseball stars sure have bloomed in this fifth month of the 2024 calendar. Some of the hottest players of the past few weeks are your usual suspects. Aaron Judge is mashing. Shohei Ohtani is great. So is Kyle Tucker. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. has caught fire—though the Blue Jays have not. There also have been several surprise infernos. Who had Garrett Crochet tabbed as a possible AL Pitcher of the Month? Is it time to start taking the Kansas City Royals seriously? And do the Yankees even miss Gerrit Cole with the way their rotation has been humming along? Every player, team and position group on this list has been red hot in May. Let's do some buying and selling of whether that will continue into June. May Stats : .383/.505/.938, 11 HR, 25 R, 21 RBI Spoiler alert: Aaron Judge is good. The year didn't start out that way, though. He ended April with a .207 batting average and a .754 OPS that left us to wonder if he was OK and whether the Yankees could get by with just Juan Soto carrying the offense. Suffice it to say, things changed for the better in what has historically been his favorite month for mashing baseballs. For his career , Judge has an OPS of .917 or better in each month. May has always been his favorite, though, now boasting an OPS of 1.130 in those 151 career games. The 32-year-old hit .311 with 12 home runs in May 2022 and .342 with 12 home runs last May, so .383 with 11 home runs is basically par for the course at this point. In 2022, he only got better from there, posting a 1.286 OPS after the All-Star Break en route to the AL HR record. And last year, it was only because of the toe injury that sidelined him for nearly two months that he didn't run away with what would have been the third AL home run crown of his career. Barring another injury, we expect more of the same. He presumably won't have a near 1.000 slugging percentage from June-September, but a 1.000 OPS the rest of the way en route to another 50-plus homer season is more than doable. Judge is back, and baseball is more fun for it. Verdict : Buying May Record : 16-7, +34 run differential When the Royals—one year removed from the worst season in franchise history—ended April at 18-13 and tied for the best run differential in the majors, it was a fun little story. It was a better version of both Oakland and Washington unexpectedly treading water just below .500, but not quite as impressive as Pittsburgh's 20-8 start to last season. Now, Memorial Day is done, and there sits Kansas City 14 games above .500, forcing us to wonder whether this is actually going to be one of the greatest rags-to-riches stories in MLB history. What makes this feel sustainable is that with the exception of Salvador Perez hitting like he used to three to four years ago, the Royals aren't overachieving at the plate. They are opportunistically hitting much better with men on base (.305/.371/.477) than they are with the bases empty (.217/.276/.367), but, if anything, they are waiting on the likes of Hunter Renfroe, MJ Melendez and Vinnie Pasquantino to start pulling their weight. This might actually be a playoff-caliber offense with Bobby Witt Jr. leading the way. What feels much less sustainable is Seth Lugo vying for a Cy Young while Brady Singer and Alec Marsh are both sitting on sub-2.70 ERAs after each finishing last season north of 5.50. Then again, Lugo has had a 3.60 or lower ERA in five of the last six seasons, and both Singer and Marsh are young enough that it's plausible they've simply leveled up after a rough go last season. Per MLB.com , the greatest single-season improvement in the divisional era was the Arizona Diamondbacks gaining 35 wins from 65 in 1998 to 100 in 1999. To match that feat after going 56-106 last season, the Royals need to play just six games above .500 the rest of the way, to finish at 91-71. Keeping pace with the Yankees/Orioles for the AL's No. 1 seed in the playoffs probably isn't happening, so we're selling the Royals maintaining the .700-ish winning percentage they've had in May. But if you're asking if we're buying or selling the Royals as a 91-win playoff team? Verdict : Buying May Stats : .209/.292/.302, 1 HR, 5 RBI, 13 SB At the plate, Elly De La Cruz's May has been a major step backward from an incredible March/April. A .962 OPS with eight home runs gave way to a .594 OPS, one homer mess. He's still running, though. A lot. In fact, EDLC is averaging almost as many stolen bases per game played in May (0.57) as he did in March/April (0.60), even with an on-base percentage that has dropped by nearly 100 points. While I'm not sure exactly how often he is attempting to steal when there is a base open in front of him, let's just say it's pretty often. He stole two bases in three consecutive games earlier this month, and he had four stolen bases in a single game against the Dodgers on May 16. Needless to say, the 22-year-old is doing some serious work with his permanent green light, and it's beyond time to start giving real consideration to the historic pace he is on. In MLB history, there have been 20 instances of a player stealing at least 100 bases in a single season, 12 of which occurred in 1895 or earlier. Take those archaic numbers out of the dataset and you're left with Maury Wills in 1962, Lou Brock in 1974, Rickey Henderson three times (1980, 1982 and 1983) and Vince Coleman three times (1985, 1986 and 1987.) And at roughly 0.6 stolen bases per game, De La Cruz has a realistic shot at joining that exclusive club if he continues to play every day. Considering this is the phenom who stole second, third and home in a single plate appearance last season, it's hard not to buy De La Cruz reaching triple digits, provided he stays healthy. Verdict : Buying May Record : 18-5, +67 run differential The Phillies already had nearly the best record in baseball at the end of April, but they found a brand new gear of excellence in May, averaging two runs scored for each run allowed in their first 22 games of the month. At 36-14, they had gotten out to the best 50-game start in a season since the 2001 Seattle Mariners went 38-12 en route to their historic 116 wins. A big part of that sustained success has been the incredible work of Edmundo Sosa filling in for Trea Turner at shortstop. While the $300 million man continues to nurse a hamstring injury, his $1.7 million backup has been on fire, posting a 1.087 OPS since replacing Turner on May 3. Across the board, the pitching has been superb. Ranger Suárez got roughed up a bit Sunday afternoon at Coors Field, but only after winning nine consecutive starts in which he allowed a combined total of seven earned runs. He's still a strong candidate for NL Cy Young, albeit with both Aaron Nola and Zack Wheeler still very much in that conversation. And if you take out José Alvarado giving up five earned runs on Opening Day, the Phillies have five relievers with an ERA of 1.80 or better. So, is this officially the team to beat? They have the best record in baseball, but has this incredible May pushed them ahead of both the Braves and the Dodgers as the best team in baseball? Considering they've only played one series in this entire season against a team that currently has a winning record—losing two of three at home against Atlanta to open the season—at least a bit of skepticism seems fair. This is clearly a good team, and one that is already all but guaranteed to make the postseason. But let's wait until those back-to-back series against Atlanta and Los Angeles in early July before we get too carried away here. Verdict : Selling May Stats : 5-0, 32.0 IP, 23 H, 2 ER, 2 BB, 45 K, 0.56 ERA, 0.71 WHIP, 12.7 K/9 From 2012-18, Chris Sale was one of the best in the business. He never won a Cy Young, but he placed top-six in the AL vote in all seven of those years. He was right up there with Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer as MLB's premier pitcher. After a half-decade of injury-plagued seasons, Sale is back on top of the mountain, making one heck of a push for the Cy Young trophy that never came in the American League. Sale's slider has always been elite. Even in the rough years, he never allowed a .200 batting average against it, and that's no different this year. The big change has been the effectiveness of his change, which is decimating right-handed hitters. Opponents hit .309 against Sale's changeup last season and .432 in 2021, but they are 4-for-33 (.121) this season after going just 1-for-20 in May. The 35-year-old used to get a decent number of strikeouts via the changeup back in 2013-15, but it is less of a wipe-out pitch and much more of a professional nuisance these days; a great tool for inducing weak contact. Throw in the fact that the average velocity on his four-seamer is up nearly one mph from where it had been in 2019, 2021 and 2023, and he has been mowing down the competition, allowing either zero or one run in each of his last six starts. Do we expect him to maintain the 0.56 ERA and 22.5 K/BB ratio that he posted in May? Heck no. But this also doesn't look fluky. As long as he stays healthy, he should remain dominant. (At any rate, with both Spencer Strider and now Ronald Acuña Jr. done for the season, Atlanta needs him to be great.) Verdict: Buying May Stats : .253/.406/.722, 11 HR, 18 R, 19 RBI, 4 SB For too long, Kyle Tucker was the overlooked star of the Houston Astros machine. The 27-year-old led the team in bWAR last season, this after ranking second (to George Springer) in 2020, second (to Carlos Correa) in 2021 and third (behind only Yordan Alvarez and Justin Verlander) in 2022. In other words, Tucker is well on his way to a fifth consecutive season of providing more value than either Jose Altuve or Alex Bregman. Yet, it wasn't until he stormed out to the MLB lead in home runs earlier this month that most fans outside of Houston began to appreciate how great he has been for awhile now. Ready for the fun part? Tucker has been terribly unlucky on batted balls this month. While the likes of Aaron Judge and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. entered play Monday with BABIPs north of .400 in May, Tucker was sitting at .170, good for near dead-last in the majors. He has made up for it, though, by drawing walks at an unusually high rate and batting quite a few balls out of play—a.k.a. homering 11 times. While it's highly unlikely he will continue to homer at a rate of once for every 9.2 trips to the plate, there's no good reason to assume he can't keep up the rest of what he's been doing. Maybe some of those home runs turn into doubles or long outs, but with the trade-off of that BABIP climbing back up to a normal range. Tucker is the real deal and a legitimate threat to win AL MVP. Verdict : Buying May Stats : 4-1, 29.0 IP, 16 H, 3 ER, 5 BB, 38 K, 0.93 ERA, 0.72 WHIP, 11.8 K/9 Garrett Crochet missed all of 2022 and a good chunk of 2023 while recovering from Tommy John surgery. After being drafted by the White Sox in the first round in 2020, all 84 of his appearances between the minors and majors from 2020-23 came in a relief role, maxing out at 12 batters faced in a single outing. But now there's a decent chance he'll be named AL Pitcher of the Month after making five strong starts and somehow even winning four games for the worst team in baseball. Make it make sense, please. At least when Cole Ragans broke out in a big way last season in Kansas City, he had a decent amount of experience as a starting pitcher, he wasn't recently removed from TJ surgery while getting his arm stretched out and he was, to some extent, benefitting from a change of scenery. Crochet all of a sudden becoming an ace after not starting a game in more than four years is simply wild. After opening the season with back-to-back quality starts against Detroit and Atlanta, the 24-year-old went through a rough patch in April. But outside of a couple of taters by Willson Contreras and Adley Rutschman, he has been almost untouchable in May, whiffing 11 Guardians on May 10 and 11 Orioles on Sunday. Is it sustainable, though? The year-to-date xFIP (2.52) and xERA (2.17) marks are certainly big believers in Crochet. Among qualified pitchers, that is the lowest xERA and the fourth-lowest xFIP. That comes with the territory of averaging better than six strikeouts per walk and leading the majors in K/9. If the whiffs keep coming, the White Sox might actually have something special on their hands. Verdict : Buying Crochet as a legitimate building block for woebegone Chicago, but selling him as a candidate for Cy Young votes. May Stats : 24 starts, 142.2 IP, 16-5, 1.96 ERA, 0.96 WHIP, 9.0 K/9 While reigning AL Cy Young winner Gerrit Cole continues to rehab from the elbow inflammation that shut him down after just one appearance in spring training, the New York Yankees are inexplicably in no rush to get him back, boasting the most potent starting rotation in baseball. For three of their five starters, thriving in May hasn't been a huge surprise. Both Marcus Stroman (30.1 IP, 1.78 ERA, 3 QS) and Carlos Rodón (28.1 IP, 3.49 ERA, 4 QS) rank among the 20 highest-salaried pitchers in the majors for a reason. Nestor Cortes (23.2 IP, 2.28 ERA, 2 QS) has yet to get his big payday, but he has recovered from a rough, injury-filled 2023 to regain his dominant 2021-22 form. However, are Clarke Schmidt (29.2 IP, 1.82 ERA, 2 QS) and Luis Gil (30.2 IP, 0.59 ERA, 5 QS) serious right now? Schmidt at least was a first-round draft pick and a consensus top-100 prospect at one point, but he had a 4.64 ERA in his first full season in the majors last year. Meanwhile, Gil came out of nowhere after missing the majority of the past two years following Tommy John surgery. He always had solid strikeout stuff, but he had a 5.76 ERA in 19 appearances in Triple-A and almost certainly wasn't going to crack the Opening Day roster if Cole wasn't hurt. Now, let's talk about the xFIP. These five starters have a collective ERA of 1.96 in May, which is best in the majors by far. What they also have is a collective xFIP of 3.83 , which puts them right in the middle of the pack and suggests some painful regression to the mean should be coming soon. It's all five pitchers, too, just to be clear. The only one who doesn't have an xFIP at least a full run greater than his ERA is Rodón (3.49 ERA, 4.32 xFIP, 4.93 FIP). There should be some slippage across the board. Is the rotation better than expected and good enough to anchor an AL East champion? Sure, especially once Cole is back in the mix. But one great month doesn't make this the second coming of the mid-1990s Atlanta Braves. Verdict : Selling May Stats : .407/.484/.543, 2 HR, 13 R, 14 RBI In April, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the face of Toronto's failures; the three-time All-Star whose sub-.700 OPS was dragging the Blue Jays to the AL East basement while simultaneously decreasing his trade value if they ended up selling ahead of the deadline. And now? Well, the Blue Jays are even worse, carrying an 8-13 May record into Memorial Day. A July 30 fire sale is looking more and more imminent by the day. Can't blame Guerrero anymore, though, as he has gone 33-for-81 at the dish, reaching base safely at least three times in eight of those 21 games. The raw slugging still isn't what it used to be. He's only on pace to finish the season with 16 home runs, which is one-third of his MLB-leading 48 from three years ago. But can you really complain about a guy only hitting two home runs in a month where he's batting north of .400? What has been impressive is he's hitting every kind of pitch. Per Baseball Savant , Guerrero went 0-for-16 with eight strikeouts in April on at-bats that ended on an offspeed pitch, but he's 6-for-14 with just one K in May—and both of his homers this month were off changeups. In Sunday's four-hit game against the Tigers, those hits came against a four-seamer (two), a slider (one) and a sinker (one). Baseball Savant also shows that Guerrero's 2024 chase rate (22.5 percent) and first pitch swing percentage (26.6) are considerably lower than in any previous season, so he's showing more patience and seeing the ball better than he ever has. The big question is whether the power will resurface before the batting average returns to a more normal level. Verdict: Selling Guerrero as a .400 hitter, but buying that he has figured things out after a rough start. May Stats : .338/.411/.625, 6 HR, 16 RBI, 8 SB Most of the Dodgers' key batters have been (by their standards) just OK in May. Both Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman have an OPS slightly below .800, combining for a modest five home runs. Max Muncy was batting .175 in May before landing on the IL. Will Smith is also below the Mendoza Line at .194. And Andy Pages has cooled off after a hot start to his career. It's why the Dodgers as a whole have been (again, by their standards) just OK in May, going 14-9 while allowing the Phillies to surge to a nice lead in the race for the NL's No. 1 seed. The exception has been Shohei Ohtani, who just continues to dominate. Frankly, though, his numbers don't even stand out as unusual, aside from a couple more stolen bases than his typical pace. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts recently revealed that Ohtani has been playing through a hamstring contusion suffered when he was hit in the leg by a pickoff throw on May 16. It hasn't done much to slow him down, though, as he still managed three extra-base hits and three stolen bases in 10 games since the injury. It wasn't until he appeared to be running at less than full speed on a triple Saturday night that anyone outside of the clubhouse even suspected something might be amiss. Ohtani entered May as one of the top candidates for NL MVP. That hasn't changed. It won't change in June, either. Verdict : Buying",

        "content": "We're still a few weeks away from the 2024 NBA offseason, but the rumor mills is churning fierce, with names such as Brandon Ingram, Jimmy Butler, Trae Young and Donovan Mitchell very much in the mix. Any of the above being moved would probably qualify as a blockbuster (with the possible exception of Ingram), but we're going to imagine an even wilder summer. Below, you'll find reasonable deals for all four. Brandon Ingram for Harrison Barnes, Kevin Huerter and a 2027 first-round pick Reports in early May suggest the New Orleans Pelicans will \"aggressively explore\" Brandon Ingram trades this summer, but it's fair to wonder how robust his market will be. The 2019-20 season was the only time in his career he's had an above- average effective field-goal percentage, and he barely got there that year. Now, the 26-year-old is coming off a postseason in which he averaged 14.3 points and shot 34.5 percent from the field without Zion Williamson. Still, he'd be closer to a third option with the Sacramento Kings, which means he'd probably face the opposition's best perimeter defender less often than he has in New Orleans. And he's a far better creator and distributor than either Harrison Barnes or Kevin Huerter. Losing the shooting of those two isn't ideal, but having three playmakers with Ingram, De'Aaron Fox and Domantas Sabonis would give Sacramento one of the league's more unpredictable offenses. For New Orleans, this deal is a bet on Williamson, who missed the playoffs with a hamstring injury but played a career-high 70 games in the regular season. It would be easier to tailor the offense around him with Barnes and Huerter, both of whom are more comfortable playing off the ball than Ingram. The maximized version of Zion (and the Zion-led Pelicans) needs to be surrounded by shooting. Let him create from the top and have his drives flanked by some combination of CJ McCollum, Herbert Jones (who improved to 41.8 percent from deep this season), Trey Murphy III, Barnes and Huerter. Jimmy Butler for Keldon Johnson, Jeremy Sochan, Zach Collins, a 2024 first-round pick (via Toronto) a 2027 first-round pick and a 2029 first-round pick It should be noted at the outset that there's a very real argument for the San Antonio Spurs to tank again. Victor Wembanyama had a borderline All-NBA campaign as a rookie, and if San Antonio could land the No. 1 pick again and pair him with Cooper Flagg or Ace Bailey, it would have perhaps the best young duo in the league. But Wemby might simply be too good to tank (at least to the point where the Spurs would have decent odds for that top pick). San Antonio was minus-6.3 points per 100 possessions this season, but that was the result of ill-fated experiments such as the attempt to make Jeremy Sochan a point guard. When Wembanyama was on the floor with Tre Jones (an actual point guard) and Devin Vassell (a decent floor spacer), San Antonio was plus-10.2 points per 100 possessions. If we assume even moderate improvement from the Frenchman this offseason, it's hard to imagine the Spurs at the bottom of the standings again. So, instead of angling for an outside shot at Flagg or Bailey, San Antonio could make a win-now move, nabbing one of the league's best playmaking wings and an all-time great playoff performer in Jimmy Butler. Though the current expectation is that Butler plays for the Miami Heat in 2024-25, there's a case for moving him. Durability is becoming a real question for the 34-year-old, and Miami was nowhere near contention this season. Retooling with draft picks and multiple potential rotation players who are closer to the age and developmental timelines of Tyler Herro, Jaime Jaquez Jr. and Nikola Jović would have them in better shape for the future than pushing for another around-.500 season with Butler, who can become a free agent in 2025. Trae Young for Cole Anthony, Anthony Black, Jett Howard, a 2025 first-round pick (via Denver), a 2027 first-round pick and a 2029 first-round pick swap The Orlando Magic already have one of the league's brightest futures. Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner are both future stars, and the Magic had the league's No. 2 defense behind them. However, there are real offensive concerns with this group. And though it's cool to boast two forwards who can create for themselves and others, having a real, high-end point guard to take some of that responsibility from them could push Orlando to the next level. Despite the steady criticism over Trae Young's ball-dominance and lack of defense, he's still one of the league's most consistent and dynamic offensive engines. And the easy looks he'd create would do wonders for Banchero (who was one of the league's least efficient scorers) and Wagner. Balancing the shot attempts might take some time. In that trio, Young could be the third option on some nights, which would take some getting used to. But the upside there, especially in concert with the defense of Jalen Suggs, Jonathan Isaac and Wendell Carter Jr., is high. For the Atlanta Hawks, this certainly isn't the kind of win-now trade Dejounte Murray would probably want (it might make sense to move him too), but a core with Murray, Bogdan Bogdanović, Jalen Johnson, Onyeka Okongwu and the incoming talent in this deal probably wouldn't have them much further from contention than they are right now. And this timeline gives them more financial flexibility and picks going forward. Donovan Mitchell for Cameron Johnson, Dorian Finney-Smith, Cam Thomas, a 2027 first-round pick (via Phoenix), a 2029 first-round pick (via Phoenix) and a 2031 first-round pick For years, Donovan Mitchell and the New York Knicks have been circling each other in the rumor mill, but the ascension of Jalen Brunson might have ended that notion. Two undersized, ball-dominant guards in the same starting five could throw off the Knicks' budding chemistry on both ends, but it's not the only team in the city for the New York native. The Brooklyn Nets would probably be wise to move Mikal Bridges, bottom out, be patient and wait to regain control of some future picks. However, they might also have enough contracts, young talent and picks from other teams to entice the Cleveland Cavaliers (who are likely to trade Mitchell if he doesn't sign an extension this summer). A Nets squad with Mitchell, Bridges and Nic Claxton might not be much closer to contention than the current Cavs, but they are in a big market and the city Mitchell has seemingly wanted to be in since he was with the Utah Jazz. And that trio might have enough talent to attract solid role players to go with them. For Cleveland, this gives the roster a lot more depth on the wing, a 22-year-old heat-check scorer in Cam Thomas, picks and a rebalanced roster that would revolve around Darius Garland and Evan Mobley.",

        "content": "If there's any player on the New York Rangers roster that most NHL fans have gotten to know more than they wanted to it's defenseman Jacob Trouba. Trouba has earned a reputation for delivering controversial hits with various levels of severity to opposing players. We saw it from him again in Game 3 when he delivered a chicken-wing elbow to the head of Florida Panthers forward Evan Rodrigues. Trouba received two minutes for elbowing Evan Rodrigues after review pic.twitter.com/iYljVuz4FJ That hit earned him a $5,000 fine from NHL Player Safety and more exasperation from fans and others around the league that he evaded a suspension yet again. He also didn't really have much of an explanation for it afterwards. Jacob Trouba on the elbow that resulted in today's fine:\"He kind of went to the middle. It all happens pretty fast. It's not something you're thinking about 1,000 times over and over again. It just happens fast. It's hockey. I don't have a great explanation for it.\"#NYR Trouba toes, and often crosses, the line when it comes to his physical play and for all the positive things he brings being the Rangers captain and playing the way he does, taking penalties and royally ticking off opponents in the process can galvanize their efforts to try and beat them. Putting your foes on the power play and motivating them to beat you even more aren't helpful. But as dangerous as his hits have been in the past and the power plays allowed could hurt the Rangers, the thing that's been hurting them even more is the way Trouba has played the rest of the time he's on the ice. Among the six defensemen the Rangers have iced in the postseason at 5-on-5, Trouba is third in minutes played behind K'Andre Miller and Adam Fox but has been on the ice for the most shot attempts against (via Natural Stat Trick ), second most scoring chances against and has been on the ice for the second most high danger scoring chances against and high danger goals against. The playoffs are, in and of itself, a small sample size but the scope and meaning of the games enhances anything that's done extremely well or very poorly. One theory some might throw out to why Trouba is struggling is because suffering from his teammates not helping out as well. Fortunately, there are stats for that, too. Trouba's two most common defense partners (via Natural Stat Trick ) are Miller and Erik Gustafsson. When it comes to having the better percentage of shot attempts at 5-on-5, both Gustafsson and Miller are far better off without Trouba than with him. When it comes to shot quality for (also known as expected goals), Gustafsson and Trouba have done well (nearly 53 percent) while with Miller it wasn't as good (45.6 percent). Gustafsson and Trouba have each been worse off without each other (Trouba's xGF% is 40.6, Gustafsson's is nearly 44 percent), but Miller's numbers have improved to 48.8 percent. Trouba and Gustafsson have been complementary to each other. Trouba is physical and nasty while Gustafsson is a puck possessor, passer and shot generator. But this is about as much as Peter Laviolette can do to try managing the defense while not playing Miller and Fox into the ground. As good as Trouba has been about blocking shots (team leading 47 at 5-on-5) and throwing the body (team leading 44 hits at 5-on-5), and for as much as his teammates can feed off of both of those abilities, the classic thing about hits is that if you're leading in that category, it means you don't have the puck. What's more trying is the way the Panthers play makes it easier for them to expose Trouba's weaknesses. Sure, they're willing to engage with him physically and play the questionably physical game themselves, but they're also a team that forechecks opponents all over the ice and doing that to Trouba when he's out there can lead to trouble for the Rangers. Although the Rangers have a 2-1 lead in the series, Trouba's put the spotlight back on himself again. New York has been able to get by and win games despite the distraction provided by the hits, but while he's taking penalties and giving the Panthers chances on the power play, the Panthers might want to keep him on the ice more often because with the way the game has unfolded around Trouba. The Rangers haven't played as well as they could with Trouba out there, but they're obviously not going to do anything drastic like bench their captain. They could sure stand to see him playing better hockey if they're going to win their first Stanley Cup since 1994.",

        "content": "NBA free agency seems designed to keep everyone guessing. From one year to the next, almost nothing stays the same. The teams with cap space to spend are always different, and, of course, the actual free agents themselves undergo an annual refresh—with the rare exception of high-end players reentering the market after inking one-year deals. The league itself undergoes shifts in its power structure, shuffling things up, turning rebuilders into contenders and vice versa. All these ever-changing variables introduce unpredictability and set us up for surprises every summer. That said, a few free agents come with extra dashes of excitement and uncertainty. We're focusing on those figures here as a way to frame the upcoming offseason. LeBron James might not seem like a particularly intriguing (potential) free agent because, as ESPN's Brian Windhorst said on Get Up : \"I think the Lakers are going to give LeBron whatever contract he wants.\" That may be true, but there are several hurdles and uncertainties between now and the moment James signs his next deal. For example, it's possible he won't enter free agency by declining his player option at all. Per Shams Charania of The Athletic, \"the opt-in and opt-out routes are both on the table.\" Opting out of next year's $51.4 million would allow James to sign a three-year deal worth up to $162 million, and he could lobby for a no-trade clause on any new contract. Also a possibility: a two-year deal worth $104 million that includes a player option. Don't forget the potential for him to pick up his option and extend for two more years and up to $113 million. It's difficult to imagine the 39-year-old opting out and signing elsewhere, even if the Philadelphia 76ers have ample cap space, an MVP running mate in Joel Embiid and the boundless ambition of team president Daryl Morey. Let's get prepared for at least one day of the news cycle to fixate on Morey's pursuit of the league's all-time leading scorer. We also can't forget the variable of Bronny James and where he's drafted. Perhaps LeBron would more seriously entertain leaving the Lakers in free agency if his son did wind up on the right team. If you're not convinced James belongs here because a Lakers return is a foregone conclusion, just ask yourself one quick question: Can we really have a discussion about intriguing free agents without including the only one who regularly posts hourglass emojis to his socials and has made a career out of applying leverage to his team? It turns out we can't. The LA Clippers signed Kawhi Leonard to a three-year, $149.7 million extension in January, a move that signaled Paul George's own re-up was imminent. Yet here we are mere weeks from free agency, and George hasn't put pen to paper. That could be because he believes he's worth the full four-year, $221 million extension for which he's eligible. Those terms also applied to Leonard, who signed for less. Does George really view himself as more valuable than Leonard? Would the Clippers actually risk losing the 34-year-old for nothing with a new arena to open next season? The Philadelphia 76ers are probably licking their chops. They have a superstar-sized hole on their roster and the cap space to pay George as much as $212 million over four years. Even if no one else is willing to outspend the Clips on a contract offer for the nine-time All-Star in free agency, plenty of teams could complicate this situation by emerging as trade destinations. He would have significant leverage over L.A. and could steer himself to a desirable landing spot, considering he can threaten to opt out and leave. It'd be one thing if the Clips could sell themselves as the highest bidder and the place where George has the best chance to win. So far, they appear to be neither of those things. Hence the intrigue. Sentiment says Klay Thompson has to finish his career with Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, Steve Kerr and the Golden State Warriors. Financial realities, pride, the Orlando Magic's need for shooting and the non-negotiable fact that all things must come to an end beg to differ. That's the basic setup for what could be one of the more emotionally fraught free-agent situations we've seen in several years. Thompson suffered major slippage last season and didn't perform like a no-questions-asked starter for the first time in a decade. In fact, he briefly lost his first-unit gig to rookie Brandin Podziemski. That suggests the $48 million extension Golden State offered in October, which Thompson declined, will not be on the table again. If the four-time champ is willing to accept something like $40 million over two years, which would line up the conclusion of his contract with Curry's, the Warriors would probably have to grit their teeth and offer it. If that's a bit of an overpay, Golden State can justify it by noting Thompson will have a statue in front of Chase Center someday. It's also entirely possible the 34-year-old will be eager to a) get the most money he can and b) prove he's not cooked by lighting it up for another team. Yes, his 2023-24 production looks bad compared to what he'd done in the past. But we're still talking about a \"down year\" marked by 17.9 points on 38.7 percent shooting from beyond the arc. If a free-agent suitor comes calling with a two-year deal worth $50 million or $60 million, Thompson and Golden State could absolutely part ways. So...is anybody going to offer more than one guaranteed year for James Harden's services? The 15-year vet explained to Sam Amick of The Athletic that part of the reason he opted in to the final year of his deal and then forced a trade away from the Philadelphia 76ers \"was about trying to get to a situation where I could get paid and obviously have a chance to win at the highest level.\" That seems to suggest Harden, 34, believed the LA Clippers would lock him down for multiple years at the max, but it's not as if they'd be the first team to land him and then balk at a long-term commitment. Harden's history of trade requests and willingness to get uncomfortable make him a difficult player to trust. Knowing that, and considering the Clippers retained Kawhi Leonard for less than his max while failing (so far) to agree to anything with Paul George, there's no chance Harden is in line for a multi-year windfall from L.A. As for other teams who could back up the Brinks truck for Harden? Let's just say the Sixers probably aren't on the list, and even the Detroit Pistons should know better than to invest in a player laughably outside their timeline. The result of his free agency isn't that tough to forecast. He's probably going to get a one-plus-one deal from the Clippers with a second-year option, perhaps nudging up against $70 million in total value. Everything that happens before that—which could include Harden lashing out at the Clippers, threatening to go back to the Houston Rockets or any other move in his deep bag of disgruntled-player tricks—is where the real excitement will be. The Denver Nuggets can sap the drama from Kentavious Caldwell-Pope's free agency by offering him a new contract that either matches or beats the market. But will they? Despite falling to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the conference semifinals, the Nuggets should be viewed as a short-list contender going into next season. They're too good to be in cost-cutting mode and should be willing to outbid any other suitors for KCP. That said, Denver would find itself above the second apron next season if he merely opted in for $15.4 million. Going above that number, which would be a must if the Nuggets actually want to keep their starting shooting guard, will intensify the tax penalties. Caldwell-Pope is among the league's best supporting pieces. He's won rings with two franchises, defends either backcourt spot at a high level and tends to hang around the 40.0 percent mark from long range. That skill set and experience are in demand in 29 locales outside of Denver. Even at 31 and showing slight signs of decline, it wouldn't be a shocker if another team offered something close to $100 million over four years. Worth noting: The Nuggets seem to have been preparing for this eventuality. Christian Braun, Peyton Watson, Julian Strawther, Jalen Pickett and Hunter Tyson are all young, set to earn under $3 million next year and possibly capable of absorbing the minutes vacated by KCP. Also worth noting: Denver would be indisputably worse without Caldwell-Pope, one of the core members of its title-winning team. KCP is going to decline his option. Beyond that, very little about his future seems certain. D'Angelo Russell didn't exactly cover himself in glory during the 2024 postseason, making it two straight playoffs in which he saw his role reduced and impact diminished during the games that matter most. That's what makes his stated intention to apply leverage against the Los Angeles Lakers this offseason so fascinating. Because, well... what leverage? Russell has an $18.7 million player option he can decline to enter free agency, but it's difficult to spot the cap-space team that desperately needs him at a price point above that number. Detroit can clear up to $64 million but is already flush with young guards it needs to develop, and the Magic should aim a little higher in their search for offensive help. Neither the San Antonio Spurs nor the Utah Jazz seem likely to pay top dollar for a veteran guard whose game has never been about making young teammates better. Russell could broaden his options by cooperating with the Lakers in a sign-and-trade deal after opting out, but any team that acquired him would have the hard cap to contend with. When the Lakers signed the 28-year-old last summer to a one-plus-one deal in which he agreed to waive his implied no-trade clause, it appeared clear they planned to use him as matching salary in a trade. He performed well enough during the year–18.0 points and 6.3 assists while shooting 41.5 percent from deep—to stay put through the deadline, but L.A. could again view him as more of a trade chip than a key piece of the roster. Will Russell risk entering a potentially cool free-agent market by declining his option? Will he work out a new deal with the Lakers that sets him up to be traded during the season? Or will he pick up the option, return to L.A. and embrace all the uncertainty that comes with what would be an expiring 2024-25 contract? Free agency tends to be most complicated for centers because trends at the position change so quickly. In the last decade alone, teams put high values on plodding paint-protectors like Roy Hibbert, only to pivot quickly to switchable, undersized \"Draymond Green Lite\" types. Tastes today fall somewhere between those two extremes. Isaiah Hartenstein's unrestricted free agency will be predictable in only one sense: We know the New York Knicks, using Early Bird rights, can offer him a maximum of four years and $72.5 million. It's possible another team with cap space could beat those terms. The Oklahoma City Thunder, for example, could justify spending close to $20 million per season on a big man who could defend the pick-and-roll, hold up physically against conventional bigs, facilitate from the elbows and, most importantly, address their crippling rebounding deficiency. Remember, too, that the Knicks aren't just dealing with Hartenstein's free agency in a vacuum. OG Anunoby is a lock to decline his player option and could technically sign a five-year, $245 million contract to return to New York. His four-year max would top out around $190 million. Even if the Knicks don't go quite that high, they'll be cozied up to the second apron with market-rate contracts for Hartenstein and Anunoby, particularly if they also guarantee Bojan Bogdanović's $19 million for next year. Odds are the Knicks will keep Hartenstein. He proved too valuable on both ends to let go, and Mitchell Robinson's continued injury issues render the center rotation thinner than it seems. But smart teams who watched him play such a key role for a New York squad that came within a game of the Conference Finals will be tempted to make bigger offers than the Knicks are allowed to match. To a greater extent than almost anyone else in the league, Tobias Harris' reputation suffered because of his contract. Across parts of six seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers, the combo forward averaged 17.6 points, 6.6 rebounds and 3.1 assists on a 48.8/36.9/83.5 shooting split while punching the clock as one of the more durable players in the league during that span. And yet, because Harris spent that time playing on a five-year, $180 million contract, he was almost always viewed as something of a disappointment. Basically, public opinion punished him for a job well done by his agent. An unrestricted free agent at age 31, he can now look forward to something of a career reset. The market will dictate what he's worth, and it seems like a given that his approval rating will rise as he sustains his starter-level production for significantly less than the $39.3 million he earned last season. The Sixers won't prioritize retaining Harris over going big-game hunting with their cap space, and it feels like a fresh start is in order anyway. The Thunder, Pistons, Hornets, Raptors, Spurs and even the Magic could justify tossing $15-20 million per season at Harris, and the options broaden substantially if we include non cap-space teams that could offer the full mid-level exception. With bigger names on the market and the \"overpaid\" label of the past dogging him, Harris feels like a forgotten man in 2024 free agency. Don't be surprised if, when we reassess the offseason in a few months, the team that signs him rates as one of the big winners. Malik Monk's value has never been higher, and he's positioned to cash in as one of the most desirable backcourt scoring threats in a thin market. We can safely set his floor at four years and $78 million, which is the most the Sacramento Kings can offer using Early Bird rights. The Magic should be among the first in line for Monk, and the Detroit Pistons might consider spending on a guard who'd fit into configurations with Jaden Ivey or Cade Cunningham. The Toronto Raptors may need to replace free agent Gary Trent Jr. at shooting guard, and the San Antonio Spurs need players who can shoot, dribble and pass more than anyone. Each of those teams has to consider the risk of spending big on Monk after his career year, but it'd be surprising if at least one outside suitor didn't spike his price above Sacramento's range. The Kentucky product shouldn't have to convince anyone that he's capable of ditching the Sixth Man label, and his ability to perform at the highest level against top opposing lineups is a huge reason he's going to get paid like a starter. His 98 clutch points ranked in the top 15 leaguewide and were by far the highest total of among non-starters. Sacramento turned to Monk as a high-volume shot-creator in big moments, and his league-leading assist rate on drives (minimum 6.0 drives per game) marks him as someone spacing-starved teams could trust to loosen up defenses. The Kings need his offense, but plenty of other teams will want it, too. Don't be surprised if the 26-year-old, a career backup to this point, winds up getting close to a nine-figure deal. We close with a deep cut, as Simone Fontecchio spent last season playing for the Utah Jazz and Detroit Pistons, the NBA's equivalent of the witness protection program. Though he's probably unfamiliar to non-diehards and those outside Salt Lake City or Detroit, the 28-year-old forward's offseason is bound to be interesting. Fontecchio is, arguably, the best player nobody seems to know about. After 50 efficient games with the Jazz, he got a chance to add volume down the stretch with Detroit. Averages of 15.4 points, 4.4 rebounds and 1.8 assists don't leap off the page. But a 42.6 percent hit rate from deep with the Pistons, combined with eye-opening defensive skills, suggests the Italian could slot into a major role on a good team. Restricted free agency will allow the Pistons to match any offer sheets coming Fontecchio's way, but it's unclear what direction the team is heading. If only to keep him around as a trade chip, Detroit should strongly consider matching any non-ridiculous offer. It's not like combo forwards who can shoot and defend have to worry about fickle market forces changing their value. Those types of players are always in high demand. Though his track record is relatively short (two NBA seasons), and though his age means significant improvement is unlikely, Fontecchio profiles as a quality starter hiding in plain sight. He should expect to get at least the full mid-level exception over three or four years, with the possibility of a shorter contract at a higher annual value as a fallback option.

        "content": "In many ways, Jack Stacey's arrival epitomised the tactical changes that took place at Norwich City last season. He replaced Max Aarons, whose contractual situation and desire for Premier League football meant a move was on the cards from the day play-off qualification had been ruled out in spring 2023. The Colney academy graduate hadn't officially departed when Stacey arrived, but fans knew what this symbolised in reality, and the differences were clear to see. Stacey was four years older, 2.5cm taller and slightly more experienced than Aarons, who in few ways hit the brief David Wagner was looking for. What he and Aarons did share, however, was a love for attacking adventure, and that reared its head very early on. \"One of the reasons why I joined this club is the style of play,\" Stacey said straight after his first game at the club. \"He wants full-backs to be high and wide, to be creating, to be getting to the byline and putting crosses in for the strikers. That's one of the main strengths of my game.\" Within the first minute of his debut at a rainy Barnet he had completed his first cross as a Norwich player, and that set the tone for what followed. Stacey quickly established himself as a fan favourite at Carrow Road, his lung-busting runs and dangerous deliveries helping to power a shock rise into the automatic promotion picture. But as quickly as the Canaries dropped off after Josh Sargent's long-term ankle injury, the former Bournemouth right-back began to return to his shell. Stacey had an autumn to forget (Image: Daniel Hambury/Focus Images Ltd) For weeks he was marred in inconsistency, getting into the same areas with Jonathan Rowe's help but producing deliveries that rarely tested defenders or set up attackers. For two of the most important games of Wagner's future, trips to Sunderland and Cardiff, he was benched for 19-year-old Kellen Fisher. The fact that he was introduced at half-time in both of those fixtures hints at how important he was even then, but there was no doubting the evident drop in reliability. Even after Sargent returned and City regained the form they'd shown early in the season, it took time for Stacey to get back up to speed. January and February were months of transition, but he the team really hit its peak he was close to the levels he had found upon arrival. Tactically that was a hard task; with Gabriel Sara only notionally playing as a right winger, Stacey was often left to cover the whole flank alone, defensively and offensively. He coped with that remarkably for a number of weeks, with impressive performances against Sunderland, Ipswich and Stoke as Norwich marched into the play-off positions. In the first leg of the semi-final he did an admirable job, keeping the infamous left side of the Leeds attack at bay and providing a threat down the right even as Rowe struggled. The second leg was a humiliation in all quarters, and trauma all survivors of Ben Knapper's rebuild will have to get over quickly. It appears likely Stacey will be one of those, but a lot depends on which side of his game he shows to his new head coach, likely Johannes Hoff Thorup. The one of August and September is a very good Championship full-back indeed, even the one of this spring could work under Thorup with some tactical tweaks. Like many hoping to make the jump from good to great, however, improving consistency is vital for the number three. Perhaps his fast start was a sign that Stacey thrives on new beginnings, in which case this summer should provide fertile ground. Few will escape the cull of Knapper's new-look rebuild, but he has the potential to do so if he plays his cards right.",

        "content": "Plant molecular farming delivers a new way to produce scalable, profitable animal-free cheese that fulfills authentic cheese cravings. , /PRNewswire/ -- Food-tech start-up , Ltd. makes its debut in the 'happy cow' space by using plant molecular farming (PMF) to produce casein proteins for making cheese. Caseins comprise about 80% of the proteins in dairy milk. The resulting product allows cheesemakers to deliver the same genuine cheese experience as traditional dairy cheese via a cost-effective, animal-free, and sustainable pathway. Until now, cheese alternatives have struggled to offer consumers the real cheese experience, nutrition, and price. Cheese analogs do not contain the key dairy proteins, caseins, necessary to precisely recreate the sensory properties of dairy cheese. The scientists at NewMoo discovered a way to express casein proteins in plant seeds that can grow abundantly through traditional field agriculture. After three years of stealth, NewMoo unveils proteins that match dairy proteins in nutrition, composition, and function. The start-up's technology and concept are built on exclusive research and intellectual property derived at the Weizmann Institute of Science, in Rehovot, Israel. The innovation allows for the expression of two or more caseins within a single plant via a novel approach to plant molecular farming. The seeds are then sown in outdoor fields. After harvesting the plants, the NewMoo casein liquid base is produced through a unique development process that yields a hormone-free liquid casein naturally free of lactose and cholesterol and that replicates the functionality of dairy cheese. Caseins are considered the 'holy grail' of milk structure by the dairy industry. By developing animal-free caseins through plants instead of cows, it is possible to make almost any dairy product, starting with cheese. \"Our animal-free liquid casein mimics all the functional traits of real milk protein for crafting cheese the traditional way,\" explains , NewMoo co-founder and CEO. \"This means it can seamlessly replace dairy milk in any dairy cheese manufacturing facility without the need for any special equipment or reconfiguration of existing equipment. NewMoo's caseins can form the basis for a cheese that has the exact melting and stretching behavior as animal dairy cheese, and delivers the typical aroma, flavor, and texture that cheese eaters crave. Our animal-free proteins are literally identical to animal-derived caseins.\" NewMoo allows for a highly efficient, cost-effective process that sets the cow free from the industrial milk production process and sequesters carbon during natural cultivation. This makes for a more sustainable source of milk proteins. The NewMoo team boasts extensive experience in the dairy and CPG industries. \"We intimately understand the needs of food companies,\" explains Miller. \"Unlike protein powders, the NewMoo liquid casein is production-ready, helping streamline production and go-to-market. As opposed to current precision fermentation practices, our approach doesn't require expensive bioreactor machinery to grow our proteins. The plant seeds themselves act as bioreactors. This gives us the flexibility to produce these complex proteins in abundance and at exceptional cost parity.\" NewMoo's manufacturing process is easily scalable for simple implementation. \"This method of making previously animal-based foods from non-animal sources is a win-win situation,\" Miller adds. \"It benefits the consumers, the dairy producers, farmers, the health- and animal welfare-conscious flexitarians, and the global climate. We believe that this technology is the most suitable for bringing the future of sustainable animal free dairy products.\" \"Our goal is to assist dairy cheese manufacturers broaden their market scope to include the burgeoning flexitarian demographic,\" asserts co-founder Hod Yanover, Vice President of Food Development for NewMoo. \"We empower cheesemakers to create delectable and nutritious guilt-free products with ease and at no added costs.\" According to data from Euromonitor, 42% of consumers worldwide identify themselves as flexitarian. The global cheese market has been valued at and is projected to reach by 2028 .The alternative dairy movement is still lagging, largely due sensory and nutritional setbacks. NewMoo, Ltd. was founded in 2021 with a mission to help consumers enjoy milk proteins without the cow. The company raised in seed funding led by Lool and Zora ventures. This investment helped the company build a strong team, develop the R&D process for the seeds, and build the downstream process of NewMoo's liquid casein for cheese producers. NewMoo's team of dairy industry insiders consists of four co-founders, all experts across multidisciplinary fields, including plant molecular genetics and food business development.

        "content": "Vicem Yachts has already won over traditional yachtsmen with its elegant, cold-molded mahogany cruisers . Now it’s hoping to reel in anglers, too. The Turkish yard just unveiled the second sportfishing yacht in its new Tuna Masters series . The new 37 Express builds upon the 37 CC that premiered at the Palm Beach Boat Show in 2023 but features a new layout conducive to cruising. “The Tuna Masters 37 CC has garnered considerable acclaim since its debut in early 2023,” the Vicem Yachts team said in a statement. “Now, we’re thrilled to introduce the Express version to the market, which we believe strikes the perfect balance between a serious sportfisher and a safe family cruiser.” Created in partnership with Turkish designer Murat Iyriboz and U.S. outfit DLBA, the Tuna Masters can be used for serious angling and casual family outings. The two models showcase molded fiberglass exteriors, the same sleek hull, and an impressive beam of just over 12 feet. Both also deliver “exciting performance,” according to Vicem. The interior is the main difference between the two: The 37 CC showcases a walkaround center console, whereas the 37 Express has more of a cruiser-style cockpit with a wraparound windscreen under the hardtop. The Express is also outfitted with a full lower cabin. The helm is positioned front and center of the enclosed cockpit, with wraparound guest seating nestled behind. To the aft lies a triple-seater bench, two fighting chairs, a built-in bait well, and multiple pole holders. The live bait tank has an impressive capacity of 45 gallons, too. The lower deck features a galley, a head, a rod locker, and a cabin that can be tailored to the owner. (You can opt for twin berths in a V formation or a full double V-berth if you want more space.) The fit and finish are quintessentially Vicem, with teak decking and detailed joinery throughout. “The lower accommodation area is both versatile and exceptionally comfortable, notably featuring an impressive two-meter headroom without compromising the yacht’s sleek profile,” the team adds. “The 37 Express perfectly complements the CC version and underscores our commitment to enthusiasts who prioritize both fishing and cruising.” As for grunt, the Express is equipped with three new Mercury 10-cylinder 350 engines instead of the standard two 350s. Vicem says the 37 Express has a top speed of 46 knots and a cruising speed of 38 knots, meaning seafarers can quickly dart to and from the fishing grounds. You can also expect a dry ride and excellent stability, according to the yard. The first Vicem Tuna Masters 37 Express is currently in Puerto Rico. Click here to see all the photos of the 37 Express.

        "description": "Prison Society Executive Director Claire Shubik-Richards called the culinary nightmare faced by about 39,000 inmates in Pennsylvania's 24 prisons \"nutritional neglect.\"",
        "content": "PHILADELPHIA — Even as Pennsylvania's prison population grew rapidly in the 1990s and sentences became longer, the state's food bill was plummeting. By 2018, the state's Department of Corrections had one of the steepest drops in prison food costs in the nation. A recently issued report from the Pennsylvania Prison Society, Hungry and Malnourished in Prison Food Service in the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, said the cost drop was built on using poor quality food that often failed to meet inmates' basic nutritional needs and left them hungry, malnourished, prone to diet-related illnesses and dissatisfied. After analyzing the Department of Correction's master menus for a year, Prison Society Executive Director Claire Shubik-Richards called the culinary nightmare faced by about 39,000 inmates in the state's 24 prisons \"nutritional neglect.\" \"I can tell you that in 2023 and 2024 there were simply not enough calories (for inmates) and what calories there were relied on starchy filler,\" Shubik-Richards said. The Department of Corrections has both challenged and acted upon the Prison Society findings. The Prison Society routinely fields hundreds of complaints a week about prison life but when the pandemic required inmates be served meals in their cell to halt the spread of COVID-19, the number of food related complaints increased drastically. A 2021 Prison Society survey showed almost three out of four inmates said they received rotten food and smaller portions. Others said dishes sat out for hours before being served and when there was a hot food item on the menu it often arrived cold — a violation of department food safety policy. Less than a third said they preferred in-cell dining but it was because it was better than dealing with mealtime dining hall issues. The Brennan Center for Justice said mass incarceration actually means the \"U.S. incarcerates more people than any nation in the world.\" In 1980 the total U.S. prison population was 329,00. By the 1990s prison populations had exploded, but so too did states' food costs. Pennsylvania's prisons, which now provide 41.5 million meals a year, cut food costs sharply. Using 2023 dollar figures, according to the Prison Society, the daily spending on food per inmate in 1996 was $11.09 and in 2023 was $5.08. Ivy Johnson, an outreach coordinator and community responder for the re-entry support organization Why Not Prosper, experienced the state's declining food quality and quantity. She entered State Correctional Institution Muncy, located 15 minutes from Williamsport, in 1998 and remained there a little more than 18 years, where she was served almost 20,000 prison meals at the very time the state was drastically cutting its food costs. \"When I first got there, we would have meat for breakfast — bacon or sausage,\" Johnson said. That was one of the first things she said disappeared. \"The food was better. It was better prepared and initially it looked like what the (menu) said it was,\" Johnson said, adding that gradually the food got \"worse and there was less of it.\" The availability of fresh fruits and vegetables declined, and she stopped being able to identify the food by its smell. The portions on her tray grew to be unrecognizable. Johnson said if she wanted raw vegetables, like peppers, lettuce and onions or chicken instead of \"mystery meat\" patties, she had to purchase it on the prison's black market — risking punitive action. An effort to keep kosher as she converted to Judaism resulted in anemia so serious the prison doctor told her to stop. \"People think that you commit a crime so you get what you get. But my sentence was not death. And even if it was, it was not death by starvation or malnourishment,\" Johnson said. When asked about the state of hot, healthy nutritious meals, Harry told legislators at the Department of Correction's February's budget hearing that the agency had hired an additional dietician, bringing the total to two, and were undertaking a $3 million menu refresh, the agency's first in two years. The nutritional goals of the menu refresh are to increase access to fresh fruit, fiber, dairy options, whole grains and legumes while decreasing the amount of processed carbohydrates. \"That doesn't come without a price tag,\" Harry also told legislators. \"We have been having conversations about our food for quite some time and also talked to the Prison Society because we know it was an issue for them as well. We had a meeting and looked at where we need to make improvements.\" Shubik-Richards said, \"the crux of their report was looking at calories and nutrition and where the DOC was not making federal guidelines.\" Although the departmen is doing better, Shubik-Richards said improvement was still needed including fully meeting the caloric levels recommended for men. \"Prison culture which by its every nature is an oppressive, dehumanizing place. Food can play into that or food can be a little respite of humanity,\" Shubik-Richards said. The United States spends a staggering amount on its prison system, with state governments shelling out a combined $80 billion per year. Get local news delivered to your inbox!",

        "content": "Fremantle coach Justin Longmuir has defended the form of under-fire two-time Brownlow medallist Nat Fyfe amid criticism over his defensive work and ball use. Fyfe was put on notice by AFL analyst Kane Cornes who highlighted players beating him on the spread away from contests, particularly Collingwood’s Jack Crisp in Friday night’s draw. And the former Dockers captain’s ball use has also come in for criticism in recent weeks. In an interview with 7NEWS, Longmuir pointed to Fyfe’s outstanding 37-disposal performance to help beat the Western Bulldogs just weeks ago and believes he is not too far removed from that kind of form. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. “I don’t think it’s as bad as everyone is saying,” he said. “Four or five weeks ago against the Western Bulldogs he had his best game in three or four years and we are not far away from that. “He has probably been a little bit indecisive with the ball at times, but a lot of his game is in good order and I’m really confident he can bounce back.” It comes as the Dockers prepare to face a firing Melbourne midfield headlined by the explosive Christian Petracca. Cornes went as far as to say Fremantle’s midfield is better without Fyfe in an explosive assessment at the weekend. Kane Cornes has put dual-Brownlow medallist Nat Fyfe under the blowtorch and declared Walyalup (Fremantle) are a better midfield when he isn’t playing. “I think Fremantle are at their best when there is speed on the ball. The amount of time in transition or when his direct opponent (gets the ball and) Fyfe is burnt,” he told the Sunday Footy Show. “He only had 20 touches and one effective kick. His kicking is an issue. Fyfe is great in the phone box but when it gets outside of the phone box, look at the explosion from the Collingwood players. I think they’re a better midfield when he’s not in the side.” Mitchell Woodcock & Jackson Barrett Longmuir lamented their ball movement in the draw, particularly in a goalless third quarter that opened the gate for Collingwood to storm back into the game. “I wasn’t happy with our ball movement. I thought we over-used the handball, didn’t trust ourselves — especially in that third quarter — to go at the game with our handball and that probably caused the over-handball and really fuelled their pressure,” he said. “There were times where we didn’t look to take field position and play with the right intent, but it was only one of our issues.” Michael Frederick “still has a few boxes to tick” and will be assessed after Fremantle’s main training later this week in his push to recover from a concussion in time to face the Demons on Sunday.",

        "description": "•High prices of fuel and fertiliser affecting farmers•This has been coupled by rising cost of electricity",
        "content": "Horticulture farmers are pushing for payment of more than Sh12 billion in VAT refunds saying the delay has greatly affected their operations. Through the Agricultural Employers Association (AEA), they said that the situation has been worsened by rising taxes and the recent heavy rains that damaged crops worth millions. They are now asking the government to come up with a fund to cushion farmers who lost their crops in the recent rains after investing heavily on fertiliser, seeds and manpower. The association's chief executive officer Wesley Siele said some farmers have been forced to scale down production due to the financial crisis and increased production costs. He said that the VAT refund would come in handy adding that the last time the government paid the farmers was in 2020 at the height of Covid-19 pandemic “The government owes farmers over Sh12 billion billion in VAT refunds and this can be used to expand the sector and create more job opportunities,” he said. Speaking at the association's 61st Annual General Meeting in Naivasha, Siele said the rains had caused massive destruction raising concerns of food security. “We are calling for a voice of reason in the plans to increase the minimum wage bill as currently many farmers are facing harsh economic times,” he said. The association's chairman Kirimi Mpungu faulted sections of the Finance Bill, which sought to impose new taxes on farmers. He said the sector remains one of the country's economic drivers yet areas like livestock farming continue to receive minimal attention despite the high potential. Outgoing chairman Stephen Strong decried the new taxes being introduced by the government against a rise in the cost of production. “Currently the biggest challenge facing the agricultural sector is high cost of production and new taxes targeting small scale farmers and this could kill farming,” he said. Justice Fred Ochieng who was the key speaker during the meeting rooted for the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanism in resolving tens of cases involving employers and their workers. “We have come to learn that this mechanism is very effective in resolving disputes mainly in the agriculture sector where we have disputes around wages and working conditions,” he said.",

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRide the wave of surging gold and silver with precious metals stocks to buy right now. Load up before they take off.The post Glittering Gains: 3 Stocks to Buy as Precious Metals Prices Surge appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Last week, gold and silver hit record highs and investors are pondering which precious metals stocks may follow suit. Gold reached its highest level on record, and silver reached an 11-year high. While precious metal prices have retreated slightly since then, the general trend has been on the upside over recent months. Expectations also rise that this will continue for the rest of the year. Several factors are currently coinciding to push gold and silver prices higher, potentially dragging precious metals stocks up on their way. Demand from central banks remains solid. That is despite higher prices, as banks seek to build reserves in an effort to reduce reliance on the dollar’s dominance as a reserve currency. At the same time, interest rates are forecast to fall in the coming months as the Fed moves to ease monetary policy. Lower interest rates are typically correlated with higher prices for precious metals. With the Fed anticipated to cut rates later this year, three precious metals stocks, including mining and royalty firms, could surge. Franco-Nevada (FNV) Franco-Nevada (NYSE: FNV ) is one of the largest mining royalty companies in the world. It generates income through royalties without the operational risks faced by mining companies owning mines. Precious metals make up over 75.5% of the company’s revenue. Notably, 82.8% of its royalties come from mines in the Americas. This reduces exposure to geopolitical tensions impacting transport routes like the recent Red Sea crisis. The company provides financing for new mining exploration, though its activities have been constrained in the previous two years due to rising interest rates. As interest rates are expected to fall, Franco-Nevada is one of the precious metals stocks that could gain from expanding into new markets. Franco-Nevada has no debt and over $2.3 billion in cash reserves available to expand its operations. The FNV stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 35x, which is low relative to its history. Analysts have a positive outlook, with an average price target suggesting over 17% upside from current prices. Barrick Gold (GOLD) Considering its ticker, it would be rather strange to leave Barrick Gold (NYSE: GOLD ) outside a list of precious metals stocks that could gain from higher precious metals prices. Barrick is the second-largest gold miner in the world by market cap. Its value to investors offers stability in a growing environment over fast but riskier growth in smaller precious metals stocks. Barrick has been driven to increase production by 30% by the decade’s end. It follows taking advantage of the low-interest rate environment to buy up assets in the last couple of years. It focuses on so-called “tier 1” assets, such as large gold mines offering economies of scale and reducing costs. In fact, it owns one of the world’s lowest-cost gold mines, Pueblo Viejo in Panama, where it is working hard to increase production. The Barrick stock trades at a P/E ratio of 20.7x, below the average S&P 500 benchmark of 27.5x. According to the average of analyst estimates, Barrick’s stock price could reach $22.08, a potential 30% upside from current levels. Equinox Gold (EQX) Equinox (NYSEMKT: EQX ) is the last pick in this list of precious metals stocks. Currently, in a ramp-up phase, the company operates eight mines, and more are under development. Although it is not generating a profit, it is working to reach its production target of one million ounces of gold per year. The company recently acquired the remaining interest in Canada’s Greenstone gold mine. Greenstone Mine is expected to begin production in the third quarter and will be one of the largest gold mines in Canada. Analysts estimate Equinox will produce gold at a cost of $879 per ounce, less than half the current gold price. That offers Equinox the potential to increase its profit margins substantially. The sole analyst who has reviewed the company remains positive about its prospects. The forecast shows the Equinox stock price could increase to $7.30, representing a 31% rise from the current price. ​ On the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThese are the seven entertainment stocks to buy in lieu of catching the falling knife with overvalued and overhyped AMC stock.The post Roll Credits on AMC: Buy These 7 Entertainment Stocks Instead appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "As this month’s Roaring Kitty meme wave has now come and gone , it’s time to skip on names like AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC ), and look at far better entertainment stocks to buy for growth and value. Even as AMC stock has coughed back most of its gains from this short-lived meme rallies, shares in the movie theater chain remain at risk of experiencing additional sharp price declines. Mostly, because of the company’s continued aggressive use of dilutive financing methods, such as debt-for-equity swaps, as well as the sale of newly issued shares. However, if you are looking for entertainment stocks to buy , there are a multitude of much stronger opportunities out there, one of which is a direct AMC competitor. Whereas AMC is overvalued and overhyped, many of these alternative choices are undervalued, and could prove their skeptics wrong in a big way. With this in mind, let’s dive in and take a look at seven entertainment stocks to buy instead of AMC. AMC Networks (AMCX) AMC Networks (NYSE: AMCX ) may have a similar-sounding name as AMC Entertainment, but the two companies are not related. Shares in this operator of cable television and streaming networks also differ from AMC in other ways. While AMC stock is overvalued and overhyped, AMCX stock is undervalued and underestimated. Short-sellers have aggressively bet against AMC, on the view that cord-cutting and the pivot to streaming will be detrimental to its business. Still, much like I argued late last year, these negatives are more-than baked into its valuation . Shares today trade for only 3.1 times forward earnings. Although AMCX’s latest results suggest more disappointment ahead, with so much uncertainty baked into its valuation, it may take just a modicum of positive news to send this stock significantly higher. This alone makes AMCX a much better buy than AMC. Cinemark Holdings (CNK) You may justify holding AMC, on the view that the company will benefit from a further post-COVID rebound in movie theater attendance. However, if you’re looking to make such a wager, Cinemark Holdings (NYSE: CNK ) is one of the better entertainment stocks to buy. The reasons for this go beyond just the fact that CNK stock, at 15 times forward earnings, is far more attractive than AMC in terms of valuation. As Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey argued last month, Cinemark stands to benefit from having a stronger balance sheet than its peers, as well from a further contraction in total movie screens nationwide. Hickey also expects a significant increase in box office receipts starting next year. The analyst is not alone in this assessment, based on 2025 forecasts. Consensus calls for revenue to rise 13.1% in 2025, with earnings soaring 47%, from $1.19 to $1.75 per share . Fox (FOX) Fox (NYSE: FOX ) continues to be somewhat of a value trap among entertainment stocks. FOX is seen as a declining “old media” play, which benefits you if you haven’t invested yet. The Fox News Channel and Fox Sports parent continues to increase its streaming exposure, such as through the further expansion of its Tubi advertising-supported streaming platform. That’s not all. Alongside the Tubi catalyst, BofA’s Jessica Reif Ehrlich noted other potential catalysts, in her recent upgrade of FOX stock. Ehrlich noted that Fox’s linear media assets could be more resilient, due to their greater amount of live content like sports or news. She also mentioned the potential with Fox’s “hidden asset”: its option to buy a stake in online sportsbook FanDuel, as well as its stake in FanDuel’s parent, Flutter Entertainment (NYSE: FLUT ). Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF.A,LGF.B) Lions Gate Entertainment (NYSE: LGF-A ,NYSE: LGF-B ) is a media holding company that owns premium cable and streaming company Starz, as well as an 87.3% stake in Lionsgate Studios (NASDAQ: LION ). LGF used to own both outright, but this year it split off its eponymous film studio assets, through a special purpose acquisition company merger. In time, this split off could help realize significant value for LGF-A stock investors. With a market cap of $2.06 billion, LGF-A trades at a discount to the value of its LION stake, which means you get the Starz media assets for free. Also, as noted in an investor presentation, content-rich media companies have been sold in recent years at very higher valuations . Hence, Lionsgate Studios could be worth far more to a strategic buyer. Chock full of deep value, consider Lions Gate Entertainment one of the entertainment stocks to buy instead of AMC. Paramount Global (PARA) Like I have discussed previously, Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA ) is “in play,” with several strategic and financial acquirers reportedly interested in taking buying all or some parts of the media conglomerate. Sony (NYSE: SONY ) and Apollo Global Management (NYSE: APO ) have been the latest bidders for the company. Although there have been concerns they were about to back out of making a bid, recent developments suggest it is still possible. But while a possible takeover is currently the strongest catalyst for PARA stock, it’s not as if it’s the only catalyst at hand. As Seeking Alpha commentator Max Greve recently argued, sentiment for PARA has been clouded by last year’s reporting of one-time losses . Also, he argued that as Paramount is moving away from overspending on streaming content, its operating performance could improve dramatically. Improved results could, in turn, spark an additional rally. Sinclair (SBGI) If you’re looking for deep value, Sinclair (NASDAQ: SBGI ) is one of the best entertainment stocks to buy. Sure, there is a very good reason why shares in this broadcast television station operator trade at rock-bottom prices. SBGI trades for only 4.1 times forward earnings, and has a 8.12% forward dividend yield. Sinclair is highly exposed to the decline of linear media. It also has a heavily-leveraged balance sheet to boot. Yet while SBGI stock is hardly a problem-free situation, there is the potential for big rewards, if you choose to go contrarian, and buy this stock. Why? For one, further news regarding a possible sale of nearly a third of Sinclair’s stations is something that may drive another outsized move for the stock. Also, as InvestorPlace Earnings reported earlier this month, EPS came in better-than-feared last quarter . Similar positive surprises may lie ahead. Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) Yes, Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD ) has been a value trap since the Reverse Morris Trust transaction that created it closed in 2022 . At that time WBD stock traded for around $25 per share. Today, shares change hands at around $7.75 per share. Still, it’s possible shares have finally hit a bottom. At least, based on the bull case laid out by one analyst team. Earlier this month, analysts at KeyBanc who upgraded WBD to “overweight,” with an $11 per share price target. In its upgrade, KeyBanc cited several catalysts, including the prospect of WBD’s streaming segment to become profitable next year. Given some of the more negative takeaways from the company’s latest earnings release, this may not be the best opportunity out there among entertainment stocks. However, WBD is definitely a much more compelling buy than AMC.

        "description": "A recent email from the Colorado GOP, riddled with factual errors, distorts gender-related controversies and ill-equips parents and voters seeking solutions.",
        "content": "When I get home from a day of substitute teaching in public schools, I sometimes feel an unshakable need to drink Keystone beer, watch the fishing channel, and say the word “bro.” Now I know why. According to a recent email blast by the Colorado Republican Party, Democrats are using this institution to “turn more kids trans” and it’s affecting us adults as well. This rambling “Local Policy Agenda” email states “Colorado’s woke laws are coming to fruition, our women and children are at grave risk of predatory males violating their rights.” As evidence, it claims a male teacher named Ms. Sparks uses the 3rd grade girls’ restroom at Grand Peak Academy in Colorado Springs with the principal and school board’s approval. The email also references “ ... [which] requires teachers in public schools to use ‘pronouns’ for kids” that do not correspond with their biological sex. To prevent kids from being indoctrinated by Democrats, the Colorado GOP implores “all Colorado parents... remove their kids from public education.” The email, riddled with factual errors, distorts gender-related controversies and ill-equips parents and voters seeking solutions. First of all, no teacher by the name of Ms. Sparks works at Grand Peak Academy. Adults in public schools are not allowed to use children’s restrooms; they have their own adult facilities. Secondly, HB 1039 does not require teachers to use preferred pronouns. Legislators know such a law would be struck down by the courts as unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The Colorado law concerns preferred names. Requiring school personnel to use students’ preferred names could but would not necessarily violate their First Amendment rights. Students often go by other names — be it a middle name, a short version of their own name, or another name altogether. Unlike pronouns, many names are not gender specific. If parents discover school personnel have been calling their child by a different name without their knowledge and against their intentions, that’s another matter and the school should expect a lawsuit. According to , of 127 children identified with gender dysphoria, 52 had stopped identifying as transgender three years later and only 47 remained in the program for gender transition. The other students stopped responding to requests. Older studies have also shown high rates of desistence among children. Parents, not other adults, should determine how best to help their kids navigate this mental health challenge. Finally, it is demeaning to the thousands of hardworking Colorado public school teachers to characterize public schools as hotbeds of indoctrination. As a substitute teacher and previously as a school evaluator, I have been in hundreds of public schools and can attest most teachers are there to teach. Unethical teachers constitute a very small minority. In addition to inaccurately depicting public schools, the GOP email distorts gender-related controversies. There are policy disputes between those who believe sex is biologically determined and immutable and those who believe sex and gender are mutable characteristics. Both sides disagree about the best way to support people experiencing gender confusion while respecting the rights of their peers to single-sex spaces such as bathrooms and sports teams. These policy disputes will not be solved by fleeing public schools under the belief that “predatory males” are lurking outside bathrooms. This fall, Coloradans will have a chance to vote for two common sense ballot initiatives (assuming adequate signature collection) that offer fair solutions that respect the rights of students, parents, and school personnel regardless of what they believe to be true about gender and sex. Initiative 142 will ensure that parents will be notified if their children are experiencing gender incongruence. Parents can then determine how best to support their child. The second proposal, Initiative 160, will ensure biological girls have access to sports teams and programs where they can compete with members of their own sex. Boys and girls, including those with gender dysphoria, will still have the opportunity to compete with each other on coeducational teams. It’s a win-win and Republicans and Democrats should support these middle ground proposals. In the meantime, the state GOP should knock off the inflammatory and factually incorrect emails. It’s reducing whatever little credibility Chairman Dave Williams has left, bro.",

        "description": "TORONTO — A lawyer for Red Lobster Canada, Inc. says he will ask an Ontario court today to recognize and enforce the chain’s U.S. bankruptcy protection proceedings, a process which documents show could include selling Canadian assets.",
        "content": "TORONTO — A lawyer for Red Lobster Canada, Inc. says he will ask an Ontario court today to recognize and enforce the chain’s U.S. bankruptcy protection proceedings, a process which documents show could include selling Canadian assets. Linc Rogers told The Canadian Press in an email that he would make an application to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on behalf of the beleaguered seafood restaurant chain's Canadian operations Tuesday. He declined to comment further on Red Lobster's future in Canada. However, a May 20 affidavit filed with the court from the chief executive of Red Lobster Management LLC says the goal of the U.S. proceedings is to orchestrate a sale of most or all of the company’s assets, including those owned by Red Lobster Canada. \"With a looming liquidity crisis and no meaningful ability to raise fresh capital, the RL Group’s board of directors ... determined that a value-maximizing sale would be the best possible alternative,\" the filing from Jonathan Tibus says. Red Lobster, which expanded to Canada in 1983, has 2,000 Canadian employees, who are mostly part-time, non-unionized and working at the chain's 27 locations across Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The company leases 26 properties in the country and owns two others in Ontario, including a Brantford restaurant site and an Etobicoke location on The Queensway, where it owns a building but not the land. The Canadian operations made up about 4.7 per cent of the overall company’s consolidated revenue last year. Details of the chain's Canadian footprint and performance are part of a filing made last week that convinced an Ontario court to grant the company a stay in proceedings, which prevents creditors from taking action against it. The stay came as Florida-based Red Lobster Management LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. The American company had already shuttered dozens of locations while it grappled with rising costs. Red Lobster, Tibus said, faced \"significant challenges\" in recent years, including \"disruptions to its supply chain, hyperinflation affecting food, labour and delivery costs, substantial increases in the cost of capital and real property leases, and shifts in casual dining trends both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.\" Another filing from the company shows its annual customer count dropped by 30 per cent since 2019 and has only \"marginally improved from pandemic levels.\" Even its “Ultimate Endless Shrimp” promotion, which was at one-time made a permanent offering, hampered the company's financial performance. Tibus labelled it a \"significant cash drain\" that a separate filing from the company said cost Red Lobster US$11 million. The company said it is now investigating whether its former chief executive Paul Kenny and Thai Union, a seafood conglomerate with a stake in Red Lobster, encouraged marketing of the promotion that was so \"excessive\" it triggered \"major shortages of shrimp with restaurants often going days or weeks without\" the seafood. Thai Union said it has been a supplier to Red Lobster for more than 30 years and it intends for the relationship to continue. \"We are aware of the meritless allegations in the bankruptcy court pleadings and look forward to a full representation of the facts,\" Thai Union said in a statement. By June 2023, Tibus said the company had begun working on a plan to reduce spending and waste while restoring growth to the company. Court documents show the plan was meant to \"simplify\" the menu and \"implement a sensible promotional calendar with fewer limited-time offers.\" However, Tibus said the brand is still facing \"significant liquidity and operational challenges, which were exacerbated and accelerated by significant over-market and underperforming leases and poor operational and marketing decisions by prior management.\" Red Lobster did not respond to a request for comment on the filing or the future of its Canadian assets. The chain was founded in the U.S. in 1968 but has since amassed 551 U.S. restaurants and several in Mexico, Ecuador, Japan, and Thailand. Its court records say it counts more than 64 million customers per year and is responsible for 20 per cent of all North American lobster tails and 16 per cent of all rock lobsters sold worldwide. It began as a privately owned company but was bought by food manufacturer General Mills, which eventually spun off its restaurant division as a publicly traded company. General Mills sold the brand in 2014 to Golden Gate Capital and in 2016, Thai Union Group bought a stake in the chain but is reportedly divesting from Red Lobster.

        "content": "TORONTO — A lawyer for Red Lobster Canada, Inc. says he will ask an Ontario court today to recognize and enforce the chain’s U.S. bankruptcy protection proceedings, a process which documents show could include selling Canadian assets. Linc Rogers told The Canadian Press in an email that he would make an application to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on behalf of the beleaguered seafood restaurant chain's Canadian operations Tuesday. He declined to comment further on Red Lobster's future in Canada. However, a May 20 affidavit filed with the court from the chief executive of Red Lobster Management LLC says the goal of the U.S. proceedings is to orchestrate a sale of most or all of the company’s assets, including those owned by Red Lobster Canada. \"With a looming liquidity crisis and no meaningful ability to raise fresh capital, the RL Group’s board of directors ... determined that a value-maximizing sale would be the best possible alternative,\" the filing from Jonathan Tibus says. Red Lobster, which expanded to Canada in 1983, has 2,000 Canadian employees, who are mostly part-time, non-unionized and working at the chain's 27 locations across Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The company leases 26 properties in the country and owns two others in Ontario, including a Brantford restaurant site and an Etobicoke location on The Queensway, where it owns a building but not the land. The Canadian operations made up about 4.7 per cent of the overall company’s consolidated revenue last year. Details of the chain's Canadian footprint and performance are part of a filing made last week that convinced an Ontario court to grant the company a stay in proceedings, which prevents creditors from taking action against it. The stay came as Florida-based Red Lobster Management LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. The American company had already shuttered dozens of locations while it grappled with rising costs. Red Lobster, Tibus said, faced \"significant challenges\" in recent years, including \"disruptions to its supply chain, hyperinflation affecting food, labour and delivery costs, substantial increases in the cost of capital and real property leases, and shifts in casual dining trends both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.\" Another filing from the company shows its annual customer count dropped by 30 per cent since 2019 and has only \"marginally improved from pandemic levels.\" Even its “Ultimate Endless Shrimp” promotion, which was at one-time made a permanent offering, hampered the company's financial performance. Tibus labelled it a \"significant cash drain\" that a separate filing from the company said cost Red Lobster US$11 million. The company said it is now investigating whether its former chief executive Paul Kenny and Thai Union, a seafood conglomerate with a stake in Red Lobster, encouraged marketing of the promotion that was so \"excessive\" it triggered \"major shortages of shrimp with restaurants often going days or weeks without\" the seafood. Thai Union said it has been a supplier to Red Lobster for more than 30 years and it intends for the relationship to continue. \"We are aware of the meritless allegations in the bankruptcy court pleadings and look forward to a full representation of the facts,\" Thai Union said in a statement. By June 2023, Tibus said the company had begun working on a plan to reduce spending and waste while restoring growth to the company.

        "content": "Shocking mobile phone footage shows the moment black smoke billowed from the wing of an Airbus A320 aircraft. United Airlines flight 2091 was forced to abort take-off after the plane’s engine caught fire on the taxiway. The plane, which had 148 passengers and five crew members on board, was halted at around 2pm on May 27 while emergency services ‘immediately addressed' the issue. The plane, due to fly from O’Hare Airport in Chicago to Seattle, was then towed to the gate and the passengers deplaned, reported NBC Chicago. Did you know with an ad-lite subscription to Peterborough Telegraph, you get 70% fewer ads while viewing the news that matters to you. No injuries were reported and passengers were offered alternative travel arrangements. All arriving flights at the airport were halted, meaning incoming planes were left circling overhead. All operations quickly resumed. The incident comes just weeks after the nose of an Airbus A321neo aircraft caught fire moments after it landed at Seattle-Tacoma Airport on May 6. Footage showed the fire at the front of the Delta plane, below the cockpit, as black smoke rose into the air. Passengers were seen leaving the plane via an emergency exit and walking onto a wing of the aircraft. They then slid down an inflatable evacuation slide to the ground. No one was majorly injured in the incident.",

        "content": "Packers or crypters are widely used to protect malicious software from detection and static analysis. These auxiliary tools, through the use of compression and encryption algorithms, enable cybercriminals to prepare unique samples of malicious software for each campaign or even per victim, which complicates the work of antivirus software. In the case of certain packers, classifying malicious software without employing dynamic analysis becomes a challenging task. To analyze a malicious sample and extract its configuration data, such as encryption keys and command and control server addresses, we must first unpack it. We can do this by running the malicious software in a sandbox environment, such as CAPE, followed by extracting the memory dumps. However, this method has some drawbacks. For example, it’s often impossible to run the dumps we obtain for further, deeper analysis, and sandbox emulation itself requires significant time and resources. In this article, we examine a group of packers based on the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) and describe an approach for creating a tool that lets us obtain unpacked samples automatically. NSIXloader: NSIS-based crypter An NSIS package is essentially a self-extracting archive coupled with an installation system that supports a scripting language. It contains compressed files, along with installation instructions written in the NSIS scripting language. To access the contents without running the installation package, we can use an unarchiver tool that recognizes the NSIS format and supports its compression methods, such as 7-Zip. The advantage for cybercriminals in using NSIS is that it allows them to create samples that, at first glance, are indistinguishable from legitimate installers. As NSIS performs compression on its own, malware developers do not need to implement compression and decompression algorithms. The scripting capabilities of NSIS allow for the transfer of some malicious functionality inside the script, making the analysis more complex. When we analyzed campaigns involving XLoader, we noticed that packers from the same NSIS-based family are often used to protect the samples. We later discovered that these same packers are employed alongside a wide range of malicious software, including these families: Unfortunately, in the analyzed samples, we could not find any text strings that suggested an obvious name for this packer, except for the DLL name “Loader.dll” and a PDB path containing the same name: – DLL and PDF filename inside the malicious sample. Therefore, we decided to call it “NSIXloader.” Packers of this family are very widespread and have been known at least . Packed sample structure Most of the samples we analyzed have a similar file structure inside the archive. – The contents of the malicious installer package. In the root directory of the archive, there are two binary files with encrypted data. In the directory, there is a DLL exporting several functions, one of which must be called to unpack the payload. NSIS supports a plugin system, which consists of DLL files that are placed by default in the directory. The malicious DLL is disguised as one of these plugins. NSIS allows for easy invocation of plugin functions using the following syntax: The malicious installer utilizes a very simple NSIS script whose task is to unpack the encrypted files, place them into a temporary directory, and then call a function inside the malicious DLL. In the example below, the function called is “ ”: DLL The DLL functionality is very simple. The DLL reads the smallest encrypted file (“pvynjhnv.oh” in the example) and the name of the file is hard-coded. It then decrypts the file using the XOR operation with a text key: – Shellcode decryption inside the DLL. After the decryption, it passes execution to the decrypted code: – Calling the decrypted shellcode. In some variants, before using the XOR operation, a cyclic shift of each byte of the encrypted text is performed: – Shellcode decryption in some samples. Shellcode The decrypted file contains a position-independent shellcode. Its execution starts with initializing the name of the file containing the encrypted payload and obtaining the addresses of several Windows API functions. – APIs are resolved by their hashes. Instead of API function names, the loader stores 4-byte hashes computed using a simple algorithm. To obtain the addresses of the desired functions, the loader parses the header of kernel32.dll and locates the address of the export table. Next, it calculates the hash of each function name and compares it with the hash of the desired function. Afterward, the loader reads and decrypts the payload: – The payload decryption routine. Each of the analyzed samples uses a unique sequence of operations. Despite the simplicity of the cipher, to implement an automatic decrypter for the payload, we need to reproduce the unique sequence of commands for each sample. After applying this algorithm, the loader obtains the decrypted payload. Approach to automatic payload unpacking We can use 7-zip in the first step to extract and decompress the files from the NSIS package. The rest of the automation can be done in Python. After extracting the files, we need to obtain the encryption key from the DLL. In all analyzed samples, the encryption key is represented as a text string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. We can use the following regular expression for searching: The key is always located at the beginning of the or section, so it can be extracted in the following way using the library: Now that we have the key, we can easily decrypt the shellcode. Taking into account that the packer may apply the cyclic shift before the XOR operation, we can check each value of the shift and validate the decrypted shellcode using a regular expression: However, the most challenging task is reconstructing the payload decryption algorithm from the shellcode. Let’s take a look at the assembly code of this algorithm: – Specific patterns in the payload decryption routine. Each operation is followed by updating the current byte in the buffer that is being decrypted and moving this byte back to the register EAX. Then the data in the register EAX is transformed using one of the following operations: “ “, “ “, “ “, “ “, “ “, “ “, “ “, “ “, “ “, “ “, “ “. To find the beginning and the end of the decryption algorithm we can either use a Yara rule or a regular expression. When we have the required part of the code, we can use the malduck library to disassemble and analyze it. In every valuable instruction, the first operand is EAX or ECX, and this can be used as a filter. In addition, we note that the second operand can be a register, an immediate value, or a memory operand. If the memory operand is used, we can transform it to a named variable (it can be “b” – the value of the current byte, or “i” – the index of the current byte), using the following mapping: . The function “get_operation” used in the code sample above can be implemented in the following way: After we collect all the operations, we can decrypt the payload emulating the decryption algorithm: Please note that the highly simplified example we showed illustrates a possible approach to implement an automatic unpacker, but it is not comprehensive and may not work on some samples. Other variants In addition to this variant in this packer family, we discovered others, ranging from simple to more complex. Let’s take a look at some of them. DLL with embedded shellcode Unlike the previously discussed variant, in this case, the shellcode is also encrypted, but it is not stored in a separate file. Instead, it is embedded directly within the DLL and loaded into a stack-based array: – Shellcode is stored in a stack-based array. The boundaries of this part of the code containing the encrypted shellcode can be located using the following regular expression: The shellcode itself can also be extracted using a regular expression: The XOR key for decrypting the shellcode is still stored in the DLL: – Shellcode decryption key. The NSIS package contains only two files: the DLL and the encrypted payload. The NSIS script has the corresponding changes: EXE instead of DLL In some samples, the DLL plugin is replaced with a regular executable file. In this case, the NSIS package does not have a directory; all files are located in the root of the archive. – The contents of the malicious installer package (EXE variant). The NSIS script differs slightly: the executable file is invoked using the command, and the path to the file storing the encrypted shellcode is passed as a command-line parameter: The rest of the functionality remains unchanged, and the previously discussed approach can be applied for automatic unpacking. Shellcode in resources In this variant, the encrypted shellcode is stored in the resource of type RT_RCDATA: – Encrypted shellcode stored in resources. The rest of the packer’s functionality remains unchanged. RC4-encrypted payload This variant has the most significant differences and is more challenging to unpack. Let’s examine a sample where this packer variant is used. The package contains the following files: – The contents of the malicious installer package (the variant with RC4-encrypted payload). The plugin is not directly related to the packer and is an embedded NSIS plugin that provides the ability to call Windows API functions from the script. When we analyzed the NSIS script itself, we indeed saw a sequence of API function calls. Through these calls, it allocates memory, sets the memory protection attribute PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE (0x40), reads the contents of the file “ ” into it, and then transfers control there: Let’s examine the code contained in the loaded file. This file contains the encrypted shellcode and implements its loading and decryption. First, the encrypted shellcode is placed byte-by-byte onto the stack: – Shellcode is stored in a stack-based array. After we identify the boundaries of the code where the encrypted shellcode is placed on the stack, we can easily extract it using a regular expression: A simple custom stream cipher is used for decrypting the shellcode, and consists of a sequence of logical and arithmetic operations: – Shellcode decryption. To decrypt the shellcode, we can apply a similar approach to what we previously used for decrypting the payload, with slight modifications. Additionally, in this variant, the shellcode itself differs significantly. Instead of a custom stream cipher, a modified RC4 cipher is used. The RC4 key is placed in a stack-string: – The payload decryption key is stored in a stack-based array. The RC4 cipher is modified in such a way that after applying RC4, we must then perform XOR with the RC4 key on the obtained data: Conclusion This malicious packer family utilizing the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System is quite widespread and has been used for many years by cybercriminals for packing a large number of types of malicious payloads, such as loaders, stealers, and Remote Access Trojans (RATs). The extensive use and varied nature of the payloads it delivers indicate that it is likely a commodity sold on the dark web, accessible to various malicious actors rather than being the proprietary tool of a single entity. Consequently, the development of automated static unpacking tools is invaluable. These tools facilitate both manual and automated analysis by swiftly providing access to the unencrypted versions of the malware, which are essential for tasks like configuration retrieval, debugging, and disassembly.

        "content": "BEIJING — The Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee held a meeting on May 27 and reviewed two documents, namely Policy Measures to Accelerate Development of Central China in the New Era, and Regulations on Accountability for Failing to Prevent or Defuse Financial Risks (trial). Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, presided over the meeting. It was noted at the meeting that it is a major strategic decision made by the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core to promote the development of Central China. It is imperative to thoroughly understand the strategic intent of the CPC Central Committee, and the significance of strengthening the strategic position of Central China as an important base in terms of grain production, energy and raw materials, modern equipment manufacturing and high-tech industry, and also a comprehensive transportation hub, so as to advance all key tasks to make new major breakthroughs in promoting the development of Central China. The meeting underlined the need for the region to give full play to its concentrated science and education resources, adhere to innovation-driven development, and strengthen original science and technology research. The region was required to develop new quality productive forces in light of local conditions, accelerate the building of a modern industrial system, expand and strengthen the real economy, coordinate the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries, foster and strengthen emerging industries, and plan for the layout of future industries. While giving full play to its geographical advantages, the region should strengthen the construction of a modern transportation infrastructure system, and promote the efficient, free and convenient flow of factors so that the region will better integrate into serving the new development paradigm. Collaborative efforts are needed for the region to promote environmental protection and green and low-carbon development, and speed up the endeavors to build a beautiful Central China. It is imperative for the region to advance integrated urban-rural development and take solid steps to promote rural revitalization across the board. The region should attach importance to improving the capability to ensure the security of food, energy and resources, so as to realize mutual support between high-quality development and high-level security. The Central Leading Group for Coordinated Regional Development should strengthen the overall coordination to flesh out the content of all tasks, and push local efforts to fulfill the tasks by constantly checking the to-do list. Relevant departments should intensify their support, and provinces in Central China including Shanxi, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei and Hunan should bear their principal responsibilities and form synergy to write a new chapter in energizing the central region. It was noted at the meeting that preventing and defusing financial risks bears heavily on the national security, the overall development and the safety of people’s property, and it is the important work that must be done well in the process of achieving high-quality development. Formulating and introducing trial regulations concerning accountability for failing to prevent or defuse financial risks are aimed at further exercising full and rigorous Party self-governance in the financial sector. It is also meant to strengthen the centralized and unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee over work in the financial sector, and to further make relevant administrative departments, financial institutions, competent departments in the sector, and local Party committees shoulder their responsibilities. With the new regulations, leading officials at all levels will be urged to have a correct understanding of what it means to perform well. They should make sure that various tasks in strengthening financial regulation across the board, preventing and defusing financial risks, and promoting high-quality development in the financial sector are fulfilled well. It was noted at the meeting that a good job must be done in implementing the regulations. Rigor must be prioritized, specifications of the regulations must be enforced to the letter, and those violators must be held to account. The message must be brought home that those who fail to perform their duties will be held to account, and be severely punished. Financial oversight must have “teeth and thorns” and be sharp-pointed. Strict tone, measures and atmosphere must prevail in the financial sector forever.

        "content": "-- PAS-004 inhibition of in vitro NRAS cell lines does not plateau in contrast to approved MEK inhibitors -- -- PAS-004 inhibition of in vitro NRAS cell lines is greater than selumetinib and binimetinib and similar to trametinib -- -- PAS-004 shows superior activity versus selumetinib and binimetinib in NRAS xenograft tumor models -- -- Poster presentation on Saturday, June 1, 2024 at the ASCO Annual Meeting -- SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. and MIAMI, May 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pasithea Therapeutics Corp. (NASDAQ: KTTA) (“Pasithea” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing PAS-004, a next-generation macrocyclic MEK inhibitor, for the treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and other cancer indications, announced today the publication of data showing PAS-004 strongly inhibiting NRAS mutant cancer cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 0.024 to 0.306 μM. Maximal growth inhibition of >50% was achieved by PAS-004 in more cell lines than binimetinib and selumetinib. In addition, PAS-004’s cell line inhibition was comparable to trametinib in 5 cell lines tested but, in contrast to trametinib, PAS-004 did not reach a plateau. The results will be presented at the upcoming American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting on June 1, 2024, in a poster session from 9:00 am - 12:00 pm CDT in Chicago, IL.​​ “We are excited to show new preclinical data showing enhanced potency of PAS-004 when compared to approved agents, with the potential for less frequent dosing which may lead to better tolerability and compliance.” said Dr. Tiago Reis Marques, Chief Executive Officer of Pasithea. “We believe this emerging profile hits the sweet spot balancing pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and tolerability and making PAS-004 an ideal candidate for the treatment of cutaneous and plexiform NF1 as well as a potential candidate for treatment of various cancers. We are looking forward to the initial readout of our Ph1 clinical trial.” PAS-004 is the first macrocyclic MEK inhibitor to enter human clinical trials, with an expected extended half-life which may provide better compliance rates, as well as improved efficacy in NF1. Macrocycles are known to exhibit stronger binding, better solubility and longer half-life with more selectivity and less off target effect as compared to acyclic small molecules. Presentation and poster details Title: PAS-004: A novel macrocyclic MEK inhibitor to inhibit cancer cell growth in vitro and tumor growth in mouse xenograft studies. Presenting author: Graeme Currie, PhD Session: Poster Session – Developmental Therapeutics – Molecularly Targeted Agents and Tumor Biology Date and Time: 6/1/2024, 9:00 AM – 12:00 PM CDT About PAS-004 PAS-004 is a small molecule allosteric inhibitor of MEK 1/2, which are dual-specificity protein kinases, in the MAPK signaling pathway. The MAPK pathway has been implicated in a variety of diseases, as it functions to drive cell proliferation, differentiation, survival and a variety of other cellular functions that, when abnormally activated, are critical for the formation and progression of tumors, fibrosis and other diseases. MEK inhibitors block phosphorylation (activation) of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). Blocking the phosphorylation of ERK can lead to cell death and inhibition of tumor growth. Existing FDA approved MEK inhibitors are marketed for a range of diseases, including certain cancers and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). We believe these MEK inhibitors suffer from certain limitations, including known toxicities. Unlike current FDA approved MEK inhibitors, PAS-004 is macrocyclic, which we believe may lead to improved pharmacokinetic and safety (tolerability) profiles. Cyclization offers rigidity for stronger binding with drug target receptors. PAS-004 was designed to provide a longer half-life with what we believe is a better therapeutic window. Further, we believe the potency and safety profile that PAS-004 has demonstrated in preclinical studies may also lead to stronger and more durable response rates and efficacy, as well as better dosing schedules. PAS-004 has been tested in a range of mouse models of various diseases and has completed preclinical testing and animal toxicology studies. Additionally, PAS-004 has received orphan-drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of NF1. About Pasithea Therapeutics Corp.

        "content": "THE new transport secretary, Ken Skates, has been accused of “ignoring constituents” who have been left “in the lurch” after a bus service in Denbighshire was curtailed. Cllr Gwyneth Ellis, who represents Edeirnion ward on Denbighshire County Council, has hit out at Mr Skates, who is also minister for North Wales, after he failed to respond to three requests for a meeting to discuss changes. The Plaid Cymru councillor has branded the attitude of Mr Skates as “disrespectful” and “out of touch”. Transport for Wales, which is owned by Welsh Government, changed the T3 Barmouth to Wrexham bus route to avoid the villages of Cynwyd, Llandrillo, and Llandderfel, adding a new T3C Service to link these villages to Corwen. Villagers have been particularly affected as a result of these changes. Cllr Ellis has been contacted by several constituents who have been negatively impacted by the change, which include older people as well as students who are finding it more difficult to get to college. Villagers must now make a connection at Corwen which is not always guaranteed, while the service has also been removed on a Sunday. Plaid Cymru MS Mabon ap Gwynfor held a meeting with Transport for Wales about this issue but it has refused to reverse the changes. Cllr Ellis said: “My constituents have been badly affected by the changes that have been made to the Barmouth to Wrexham bus route. “Unfortunately, despite Transport for Wales being aware of the negative impact on local people, it has so far refused to reverse the decision. “Local people were not consulted when these changes were made and their wishes are continuing to be ignored. “The bus service used to go through Llandrillo and Cynwyd and this was used by local people. The changes to the route and the timetable have left constituents in the lurch. “Now the bus goes from Bala to Corwen along the Glanrafon road. Though the new T3C service has been organised so that it goes from Llanuwchlyn to Corwen through Llandrillio and Cynwyd, it isn’t working properly for local people. “For one thing, the new service doesn’t travel very often and it often misses the connection in Corwen entirely. “This has badly affected older and vulnerable residents in particular. It has disincentivised them from going to Wrexham or Llangollen on the bus because they’re worried that they will have to wait for hours in Corwen to get a connecting bus on the way home. “Students from villages such as Cynwyd, Llandrillo, and Llandderfel, who attend Coleg Meirion-Dwyfor in Dolgellau are now forced to travel to and from Corwen for connecting buses, instead of directly, and this is making life more difficult for them. “There is no direct bus back from the college site at Dollgellau to Cynwyd, Llandrillo, or Llandderfel, which I think is unfair to students who are essentially being forced to take the bus to Corwen, wait, and then have to catch the bus back from Corwen down to the villages.” In response, a Welsh Government spokesperson said: “We’ve received the councillor’s correspondence and they will receive a response shortly – we apologise for the delay.”",

        "content": "MANILA, Philippines — A coalition of major political parties in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) has urged the Commission on Elections (Comelec) to extend the June 7 deadline for the registration and accreditation of sectoral organizations vying to participate in the region’s first parliamentary elections in 2025. In a statement on Tuesday, BARMM Grand Coalition (BGC) said that its Chairperson, Sulu Governor Abdusakur Tan, wrote a letter to Comelec Chairman George Erwin Garcia on May 27 asking for the extension. READ: Comelec gearing up for peaceful, orderly BARMM plebiscite “BGC is making this request to Comelec so that more sectoral groups are allowed to register and participate in the assembly to choose their sectoral representatives,” Tan said in the letter. Tan added that a certification from the appropriate ministry, regional offices, or agencies of the Bangsamoro government is one of the conditions for sectoral groups under Comelec Resolution No. 10987. READ: BARMM Grand Coalition endorses Sulu governor Sakur Tan as chief minister This resolution sets the activities related to the first parliamentary elections in the BARMM, along with corresponding periods within which to comply. Tan noted that the Bangsamoro Youth Commission, the Bangsamoro Commission for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage, the Ministry of Indigenous Peoples’ Affairs, the Office for Settler Communities, and the Bangsamoro Women Commission have just released their respective guidelines for certification. The Darul Ifta, or Bangsamoro’s Islamic advisory council, has not yet even issued guidelines on the certification of Ulama sectoral representatives. “As the 7 June 2024 deadline to file the Petition for Registration or Accreditation before the Honorable Commission is fast approaching, the BGC foresees that sectoral organizations in the BARMM may not be able to file their respective Petitions within the given period considering that they are still in the process of applying for the required certifications before the appropriate ministry, commission or regional office,” Tan explained in the letter. “Considering the foregoing, the BGC respectfully believes that there is an urgent need to extend the period within which to allow sectoral organizations in the BARMM to file their respective petitions for registration or accreditation before the Honorable Commission in relation to the first parliamentary elections,” he added. Tan said the request does not violate any provision of Resolution No. 10984 or the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Bangsamoro Electoral Code.

        "content": "Cagayan de Oro 2nd District Rep. Rufus Rodriguez FILE PHOTO MANILA, Philippines — Cagayan de Oro City 2nd District Rep. Rufus Rodriguez has questioned the evidence raised against Manila Electric Corporation (Meralco) during the hearing of its proposed new franchise after a bank denied authorizing a law firm to file complaints on its behalf. Rodriguez, in a statement on Tuesday, urged the House of Representatives’ committee on legislative franchises to “exercise prudence” in discussing the franchise issue, noting that only “substantive and verified evidence” should be presented. The lawmaker was referring to the confirmation from Parañaque City 2nd District Rep. Gus Tambunting, that BDO Unibank denied tapping Manjares & Manjares law firm to submit a complaint against Meralco. The law firm forwarded the complaint to the committee during Meralco’s franchise deliberations. “I am of firm belief that only substantive and verified evidence should be presented before the Committee on Legislative Franchises, or any committee for that matter, so that the honorable members of Congress would not be misled by inaccurate information and for all of us to maintain the integrity of the ongoing deliberations,” Rodriguez said. “As representatives of the Filipino people, it is our obligation to resolve issues and concerns subject to our review in a fair, sober and respectful manner,” he added. Over the weekend, Tambunting confirmed to reporters that the committee on legislative franchises got a letter from BDO Unibank chief legal counsel Alvin Go stating that the bank did not authorize the Manjares & Manjares law firm to file a complaint against Meralco. The committee was asked to consider the complaint in the franchise hearing. “Yes, there was a letter,” Tambunting said. According to the letter from BDO Unibank, the bank, and Meralco are “presently engaged in discussions to resolve the issues.” Rodriguez has been adamant about granting Meralco a new franchise, saying that it will be good for the Philippine economy as it projects an image that the country is business-friendly. Other lawmakers, however, particularly those from the Makabayan bloc, said that hearings for Meralco’s new franchise should not be rushed because many issues have to be reviewed. ACT Teachers party-list Rep. France Castro said that she hopes the committee on legislative franchises would be able to study it properly first. Meralco’s franchise is set to expire by 2028. Meralco spokesperson Joe Zaldarriaga maintained that the endorsement of Meralco’s franchise by veteran lawmakers only shows the company’s efforts to deliver good customer service.

Domingo/Senate Social Media Unit) MANILA, Philippines — Senator Joel Villanueva said at least three members of “Solid 7” are now “more than willing” to join the Senate minority bloc. The Solid 7 includes former Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri and Senators Villanueva, Nancy Binay, Sonny Angara, JV Ejercito, Loren Legarda, and Sherwin Gatchalian. The faction emerged after Zubiri was replaced as Senate chief on May 20 by Senator Francis “Chiz” Escudero. “Kung ano man ang magiging desisyon namin talagang it’s all for the betterment of our service as senators of the Republic of the Philippines. ‘Yun naman ang commitment ng pito sa aming grupo,” Villanueva said in an ambush interview Tuesday.

Sonny Angara — so all of them are open to that idea of being part of the minority.) Villanueva earlier disclosed he is considering joining the two-member Senate minority bloc comprising Senate Minority Leader Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel and Senator Risa Hotiveros. He also disclosed on Tuesday that the Solid 7 has already talked to Pimentel, who expressed they are “very much welcome” to join the minority coalition. Villanueva further revealed that the Solid 7 is likewise open to speaking with Escudero to find out how they could help his new leadership of the Senate. “Again, at the end of the day, ang bottomline naming lahat dito ay saan kami mas magiging epektibo in helping the institution, our country, and our people,” he said. (Again, at the end of the day, our bottom line here is where could we be more effective in helping the institution, our country, and our people.) For him, more minority bloc members means more fiscalizers to ensure that every legislation being discussed and passed in the Senate is in the best interest of Filipinos.

        "content": "Here’s a quick roundup of today’s top stories: The Supreme Court granted the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) request to transfer the sexual abuse case against Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KJC) founder Apollo Quiboloy from a court in Davao City to Quezon City. Quiboloy and several others are charged with violation of Republic Act 7610 or the Anti-Child Abuse Law, specifically the provision on sexual abuse of minors and maltreatment. They are also facing a case for qualified human trafficking before a Pasig City court. The personal assistant of embattled Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KJC) founder Apollo Quiboloy surrendered 21 firearms in Davao City, according to the Philippine National Police. The PNP said 21 firearms belonging to Cresente Chavez Canada, also the Barangay Tamayong captain, were surrendered through a lawyer at KOJC Compound along the Phil-Japan Friendship Highway in Barangay Sasa at about 6:30 a.m. on Saturday. The Philippines on Tuesday signed three deals and a letter of intent during the two-day state visit of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. here to generate more jobs and accelerate economic transformation. The two countries signed memoranda of agreement on tourism cooperation, on maritime cooperation, and on Mutual Recognition of Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) certificates, according to Communications Secretary Cheloy Velicaria-Garafil. The number of suspected Chinese maritime militia and coast guard vessels in Scarborough (Panatag) Shoal sharply decreased while all of Beijing’s warships also left after the trip of a civilian convoy there, according to the Philippine Navy data released on Tuesday. Only 19 Chinese ships were spotted around Panatag Shoal from May 21 to 27, including five China Coast Guard vessels (CCGV) and 14 Chinese maritime militia vessels (CMMV). No People’s Liberation Army-Navy (PLAN) warships were monitored this time. The initial result of Senate President Pro Tempore Jinggoy Estrada’s survey showed a neck-and-neck fight for and against the controversial divorce bill. Based on a list that Estrada released to the media on Tuesday, six senators have so far voted in favor of divorce while five said they are against it.

The state weather bureau’s computed heat index data as of 5 p.m. on Tuesday show that the municipality’s heat index hit a sizzling 55 °C. Last May 26 and 27, the heat index in Guiuan peaked at 55 °C and 54 °C, respectively. Pagasa said that exposure to heat indices of 52 °C and beyond may likely cause heat stroke. Meanwhile, heat indices under the “danger” category (42°C – 51°C)were also logged in the following areas: 48 °C 46 °C 45 °C 44 °C 43 °C 42 °C READ: Pagasa lifts Signal No.1 as Typhoon Aghon moves away from PH https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1945591/fwd-pagasa-lifts-signal-no-1-as-typhoon-aghon-moves-away-from-ph According to Pagasa, the heat index is “a measure of the contribution that high humidity makes with abnormally high temperatures in reducing the body’s ability to cool itself.” Heat indices ranging from 42°C to 51°C fall under the “danger” category, and people exposed to these heat indices are prone to heat cramps, exhaustion, and even heat stroke with drawn-out exposure.

As a result of the massive inflow and 10.9% rate of return, the industry's assets rose 11% annually to AU$3.85 trillion, Bloomberg reported. Total contributions have surged by 11.3% to AU$177 billion in the year ending in March 2024. As employer contributions increased by 12.4% over the year to AU$133.3 billion, contributions by members surged by 8.2% to AU$43.7 billion. The two biggest market players, AustralianSuper and Australian Retirement Trust, manage a combined asset of AU$35 billion. Australian employees contribute the equivalent of 11% from their wages to the pension schemes. The contribution will soon be raised to 11.5% before capping it at 12% by July this year. The seven pension funds, known as superannuation, manage more than AU$100 billion each. But, the industry comes under stringent monitoring and annual evaluation of its performance, intended to consolidate funds, while reducing fees and increasing returns for the members. However, the biggest challenge for the pension funds is the high volume of retirement expected in the next five years. According to government data , more than 700,000 Australians are preparing to retire in the next five years, with 226,000 retiring in the next two years. As the pension funds continue to grow, investments are now expanding beyond the country leading to a huge chunk of assets being located overseas. © Copyright 2023 IBTimes AU. All rights reserved.

        "content": "UNA (HP), May 28: Calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi “anti-people”, senior Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi on Tuesday said he is misleading people in the name of religion to remain in power. “Former prime minister Indira Gandhi had given her jewellery for the country in time of need and Modi says that the Congress people will steal your mangalsutra,” she said and added that such language does not suit the country’s prime minister. Modi has started considering himself as God and thinks he would get votes in the name of religion but people will not be misled, she said while addressing a public rally in Gagret in Himachal’s Una district. Seeking support for Congress candidate from Hamirpur Lok Sabha seat Satpal Raizada and candidate for Gagret by-assembly poll Rakesh Kalia, Gandhi said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is “anti-people in general and anti-youth in particular”. She also pointed out that the Modi government reduced import duty on American apples. Sharpening her attack on the Modi government, the senior Congress leader said the BJP-led Centre had no money for the disaster-hit people of Himachal Pradesh but waived off loans worth Rs 16 lakh crore of rich industrialists, the senior Congress leader said. During the worst monsoon disaster in the state last year, people got to see the difference between the Congress and the BJP when when every Congress leader and worker was on the ground while the BJP was seen nowhere, she said. “We work for you, not for power or money and feel that it is our duty,” she added. The BJP-led Centre neither declared the monsoon calamity a national disaster, nor gave any special package for the state and rather tried to topple the democratically-elected Congress Government in the state by using money, she said, apparently referring to the controversy involving the six Congress rebels who recently joined the BJP.

        "content": "New Delhi, May 28: India is set for a significant leap in local manufacturing of displays which presents a golden opportunity for global companies seeking to diversify their display supply chains beyond certain geographies, industry leaders said on Tuesday. The Indian market’s demand potential for displays is likely to rise to $60 billion by 2025. The domestic display manufacturing industry is projected to grow at a booming 29.5 percent CAGR due to the expected surge in the local manufacturing of mobile phones, TVs and IT hardware products. We have an excellent 50 per cent capex support on pari-passu (equal footing) basis as offered by the India Semiconductor Mission (ISM), further supplemented by the state governments, but we have not been able to break ground beyond display assembly, said Pankaj Mohindroo, Chairman, India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA). Display has a major 15-20 percent position in the Bill of Material (BoM) which is close to the other logic, memory and other semi conductors. It’s a matter of great concern, said Mohindroo. Despite being the world's third largest consumer of display products (accounting for 7 percent of global revenue), the nation currently has insignificant domestic production. This presents a unique opportunity for international companies seeking to diversify their display supply chains beyond certain geographies, thereby complementing the domestic demand and also export from India, the industry leaders mentioned. For a robust display manufacturing ecosystem in the country, the AMOLED Research Center (ARC) has been set up at IIT-Madras that aims to develop next generation AMOLED displays for smartphones, tablets, watches and wearables. The national Centre of Excellence is funded by MeitY, DRDO and Tata Sons. At the ‘SID Display Week’ in the US last week, S Krishnan, Secretary, MeitY, addressed the forum virtually and highlighted fiscal support of 50 percent capex support on pari-passu basis by the government to set up display fabs in the country. Harit Doshi, Secretary, Society of Information Display (SID) and CEO of Omniply Technologies, spoke about a conducive policy framework in India for international investors in the domain of display manufacturing ecosystem. These targeted efforts aim to cultivate tangible investment opportunities and propel India to the forefront of display technology development, said Mohindroo.",

        "content": "COLOMBO, May 28: Sri Lankan security forces suspect that a 46-year-old man acted as a handler of the four Sri Lankan nationals who were arrested at Ahmedabad airport in India last week for suspected links with the banned Islamic State (ISIS) outfit, according to a media report. Sri Lanka Police revealed that the wanted suspect, identified as Osmand Gerrard – a resident of Dematagoda, often changes his appearances, and these are some of his appearances that detectives suspect he may be using now, Newsfirst news portal reported on Monday. Gerrard is believed to have facilitated the movement of the suspected Sri Lankans from the country to India, the news portal said on Tuesday. Sri Lanka Police recently announced a cash award of Rs. 2 million for any credible information on the whereabouts of the wanted suspect. The exchange of information between Sri Lanka and India has commenced concerning the Sri Lankans arrested in India. This collaborative effort involves both the Sri Lanka Army Intelligence Division and the Police Terrorist Investigations Division, the news portal said on Tuesday. The Gujarat Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) on May 19 arrested four Sri Lankans with links to the ISIS at the Sardar Vallabhai Patel airport in Ahmedabad. The ATS also seized three pistols and cartridges abandoned at a location in Ahmedabad based on geo-coordinates and seized a mobile phone from their possession. The four men had taken an Indigo flight out of Colombo to Chennai on May 19. Among the arrested individuals, Mohammed Nusrat is a businessman involved in importing telecommunication devices and electrical equipment from countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Dubai, the news portal said. Nusrat operated within Colombo, where he sold these imported goods. Mohammad Nafran, 27, who was also arrested, has been identified as the son of the first wife of Niyas Naufer aka ‘Potta Naufer’ the notorious underworld criminal who was sentenced to death for the killing of High Court Judge Sarath Ambepitiya. The other two Sri Lankans are 35-year-old Mohammad Faris from Maligawatte, Colombo and 43-year-old Mohammad Rashdeen from Colombo 13. Mohammad Faris had worked as a ‘Nattami’ or cart puller in Pettah, and was arrested by the Colombo Crimes Division on March 11, 2023, and November 1 of the same year. On May 21, his close associate Hameed Amir was arrested by the Terrorist Investigations Division. Mohammad Faris left for Chennai, India on May 19. The other suspect is Mohammad Rashdeen, a three-wheeler driver. Security forces suspect that he is linked to trafficking crystal meth or ICE. On September 16, 2022, Rashdeen was arrested by the Foreshore Police and was later released on bail. Last week, the Sri Lankan authorities launched a high-powered operation to investigate the four Sri Lankans arrested in Gujarat. (PTI)",

        "content": "Millions of Sky and BT customers are set to receive ultra fast broadband speed upgrade in more than 500 places across the UK. More than 500 locations have been earmarked for ultra fast 1.8Gbps capable speeds, allowing users to download a full HD movie in about 40 seconds. Openreach is embarking on a massive upgrade expected to cost up to £15billion. Their network is used by big brands like BT, Sky, Vodafone and TalkTalk. “This is a UK infrastructure success story,” declared Clive Selley, CEO, Openreach. “We’re on track and on-budget to make this life-changing broadband technology available to 25 million homes and businesses, and no company is building faster or further in Europe, that we’re aware of.” He went on to say: “We won’t be stopping there either.

Ultimately, we’ll reach as many as 30 million premises by the end of the decade if there’s a supportive political and regulatory environment.” “Over time, we’ve learnt to deliver predictably, consistently and at a rapid pace – despite this being a hugely complex national engineering project. That gives us confidence to be even clearer about our build plans, and we want to be as transparent as possible about where and when we’re building,\" he added in a statement today (Tuesday). \"Today we’re publishing more detail than ever about the places we’re building in now, and the communities we’ll be upgrading next,” he advised. Already, more than 4.7 million homes and businesses across the UK have upgraded to Full Fibre and the number is growing, with more than 50,000 orders being placed each week. To keep residents informed, Openreach has updated its online map and postcode checker to provide a clearer view of their progress.",

        "content": "News | Politics I would like to be emailed about offers, event and updates from Evening Standard. Read our privacy notice . Rachel Reeves declined to say she was “a socialist” just a day after Sir Keir Starmer described himself as one. Asked whether she was a socialist during a campaign visit to Rolls-Royce in Derby , the shadow chancellor said she had “always called myself a social democrat”. She said: “What I mean by that is that I believe that children from whatever background they come from should get an equal start in life to the opportunities that our country offers. I want businesses to be successful, and that includes paying people at the top properly for the work that they do Rachel Reeves “I believe in strong public services to support people all through their lives from the cradle to the grave, and I believe that work should always pay and offer security to people.” Ms Reeves added that looking at Labour’s proposals and record in government was more important than “fixating on labels”. Asked whether she was “relaxed” about people getting rich, she said: “I want businesses to be successful, and that includes paying people at the top properly for the work that they do. “But I’m also committed to turn the minimum wage into a real living wage so that ordinary working people also benefit when the economy grows and is successful.” In 1998, then-minister Peter Mandelson famously said he was “intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich, as long as they pay their taxes”. On Monday, party leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was both a “socialist” and a “progressive” when asked the same question, adding: “I’d describe myself as somebody who always puts the country first and party second.” Shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC earlier on Tuesday that he was a “Christian socialist” in “the best traditions” of the term. He added: “That’s about putting people first and to do that, you’ve got to have a set of policies that will deliver for people.” Giovanni Pernice declares his love for girlfriend Molly Brown amid Strictly probe Keir Starmer: I'll end 'London bashing' and get more homes 'built at speed' if PM Labour’s plans require no more tax rises, Reeves says Enter the AXA Startup Angel competition to win £25,000 Create a FREE account to continue reading Registration is a free and easy way to support our journalism.

        "description": "\"The two areas we should look at are goal-line technology and red cards\".",
        "content": "Using VAR in hurling and football matches could be a way of “righting wrongs on the field,” a former GAA president has said. The technology has been used in the Premier League since 2021 and has made numerous controversial decisions since, resulting in a proposal from Wolves to scrap Video Assisted Refereeing (VAR) from next season. Calls for some form of VAR introduction to the GAA gained traction last year after O'Loughlin Gaels were denied a goal that should have been in the All-Ireland club hurling final. On Newstalk Breakfast today, former GAA president Liam O’Neill said he’s “always been in favour” of using technology to assist referees. “We would have good reason in Laois to consider all possibilities of righting a wrong on the field,” he said. “You will remember in 1981 we lost a Leinster Championship semifinal to Offaly, who went on to win the All-Ireland, because of a goal that went through the side netting. “The two areas we could look at are goal-line technology and red cards – possibly, that’s enough.” Mr O’Neill noted the GAA could learn from how the Premier League has used VAR. “VAR has caused a lot of bother in the Premier League, so much so that they’re considering getting rid of it,” he said. “I think we would need to learn from the mistakes they’ve made, experiment with this, and see where it will go – I wouldn’t like to jump in straight away. “Goal-line technology in hurling is not as easy in hurling as it is in soccer, the ball is a lot smaller and it’s much more difficult.” Mr O’Neill added that there would be logistical issues with bringing video assistance technology to regional stadiums in Ireland. Former All-Ireland referee Brian Gavin said VAR is “something we need to consider” in the GAA. “We need to get all stakeholders in a room pretty shortly to discuss it and I would be of the opinion that we don’t go down the soccer route and help out referees for all decisions,” he said. “My main topics would be around the red card incidents and goal-line technology. “We’ve seen in the last number of years, this year even with O’Loughlin Gaels in the club final that wasn’t given, Friday night in the U21 championship there was a goal not given – so how can we help the referee and officials?” Mr Gavin proposed trialing a simplified version of VAR. “As a pilot scheme, we could have somebody wired up to the referee who has the live video that is going out to the screens of people at home,” he said. “They could contact the referee after looking at it on the screen and say, “The flag has to go up – that’s a goal”. “People at home looking at it know quicker now whether that ball crossed the line or not.” You can listen back here: Main image: VAR referee Bas Nijhuis working at the VAR center in the headquarters of the Dutch football association.

        "content": "PARA pejabat dan pengusaha di Kabupaten , Jawa Barat, mengumpulkan donasi sebesar Rp89 juta. Donasi tersebut akan disalurkan membantu anak penderita (tengkes) di Kecamatan Cipanas. Bupati Cianjur Herman Suherman mengapresiasi antusiasme para pejabat di lingkungan Pemkab Cianjur serta pengusaha yang peduli membantu anak penderita stunting. Pada kegiatan Gerakan Bersama Orangtua Asuh Anak Stunting (Gebrak Roasting) mereka berdonasi sebagai bentuk kolaborasi. \"Gebrak Roasting kali ini dilaksanakan di Kecamatan Cipanas. Alhamdulillah, saya bersyukur ternyata para pejabat dan pengusaha antusias dalam rangka kebersamaan membantu anak-anak stunting,\" kata Herman seusai kegiatan Gebrak Roasting di Grand Aston Puncak Hotel & Resort di Desa Ciloto, Kecamatan Cipanas, Selasa (28/5). Hasil pendataan, tambah dia, di Kecamatan Cipanas terdapat sebanyak 349 orang anak penderita stunting. Dengan kebersamaan, diharapkan jumlahnya semakin berkurang. \"Alhamdulillah dari berbagai bantuan, jumlah anak stunting di Kecamatan Cipanas terus berkurang,\" tuturnya. Herman menuturkan, donasi yang terkumpul spontan sebesar Rp89 juta akan disalurkan kepada anak penderita stunting. Penyalurannya dilakukan melalui forum. \"Kita sekarang ada forum untuk penanganan anak stunting. Nanti donasi ini kita serahkan ke forum untuk selanjutnya diserahkan ke setiap anak penderita stunting,\" sebutnya. Namun Herman mengingatkan kepada orangtua penerima manfaat agar menggunakan dana dari donasi itu untuk menangani anak mereka yang stunting. Artinya, dana itu tidak boleh digunakan untuk kepentingan yang lain. \"Saya juga berharap agar kegiatan Gebrak Roasting ini bisa dilaksanakan di setiap kecamatan. Dengan kebersamaan, saya yakin penanganan stunting bisa lebih cepat dilakukan,\" tegas Herman. Saat ini angka prevalensi kasus stunting di Kabupaten Cianjur tinggal 11,4%. Penurunan angka kasus stunting relatif cukup signifikan mengingat sebelumnya berada pada kisaran 33,7%. \"Saya optimistis Kabupaten Cianjur bisa zero stunting. Anak-anak sekarang merupakan investasi untuk mewujudkan Indonesia Emas pada 2045,\" pungkasnya. Kepala Dinas P2KBP3A Kabupaten Cianjur, Amad Mutawali, menambahkan Gebrak Roasting merupakan salah satu upaya menurunan angka prevalensi stunting. Berbagai langkah yang dilakukan semata-mata untuk mewujudkan target nol stunting.",

        "description": "Indian climber rescued from Mount Everest dies in Nepal, 8th death this season",
        "content": "Listen to Story A 46-year-old Indian climber who was rescued from Mount Everest last week has died in a Kathmandu hospital, raising the total fatality count for this climbing season on the world's highest peak to eight, a Nepali tourism official said. The climber, identified as Banshi Lal, was airlifted from Everest last week and admitted to a hospital in Nepal's capital. \"He died at the hospital yesterday,\" confirmed Rakesh Gurung of the tourism department to news agency AFP . Among the eight fatalities this season are three individuals -- a British climber and two Nepali guides -- who are listed as missing but presumed dead. The latest death coincides with the nearing end of the Everest mountaineering season , which has seen a relatively lower death toll compared to previous years. Last year, 18 climbers lost their lives on the mountain, marking it as the deadliest season on record. Additionally, three more climbers died while climbing other Nepali peaks: a Romanian aiming for Lhotse, Everest's neighbour, a French climber; and a Nepali climber, both on Makalu, the world's fifth-highest mountain. Nepal, home to eight of the world's ten highest peaks, attracts hundreds of adventurers each spring when warmer temperatures and calmer winds create optimal climbing conditions. All the deaths on Everest this season occurred above 8,000 meters (26,200 feet) in the \"death zone,\" where the thin air and low oxygen levels significantly increase the risk of altitude sickness, AFP reported. Despite the fatalities, multiple records have been broken this year . Nepali climber Phunjo Lamam set a new record for the fastest ascent of Everest by a woman, reaching the summit in 14 hours and 31 minutes. Traditionally, climbers spend days reaching the 8,849-meter peak, acclimatising at various camps along the way. Additionally, 54-year-old Kami Rita Sherpa, dubbed \"Everest Man,\" reached the summit for a record 30th time, three decades after his first ascent. This year, Nepal issued over 900 climbing permits, including 419 for Everest , generating more than $5 million in royalties. Over 600 climbers and their guides have already summited Everest following the establishment of the rope-fixing team last month. In a significant development, China reopened the Tibetan route to foreign climbers for the first time since closing it in 2020 due to the Coronavirus pandemic.",

        "content": "The Periyar University administration, in a circular, said it was going to make face-based attendance system compulsory for calculating salaries and instructed staff and faculty members to follow the system. In a circular dated May 27, the Periyar University Registrar (in-charge) P. Viswanathamurthi said that in the earlier circular issued on August 30,2023, the university instructed faculty members and staff, including consolidated and daily wagers, to follow eight rules and to register their attendance in a face-based attendance system. As per the eight rules, the staff should log in before 9.30 a.m. and log out after 5.15 p.m. Permission will be given for one hour for two days in a month and after those two days, if the staff log in after 9.30 a.m. and log out before 5.15 p.m., that day will be considered leave. The monthly salary will be calculated based on the face-based attendance. The staff should submit the letter with the concerned in-charge officials signatures for permission or leave before or after the day of leave. If staff fail to submit the letter, that day will be treated as a loss of pay. To work on weekends or holidays at the university, staff should get prior permission from the Registrar and submit that permission letter to the concerned department. To work late hours, the staff should get permission from the administration. The staff should avoid going out of the university campus during working hours and concerned department in-charge officials should ensure staff are in their seats on duty time. The university received complaints that these rules were not followed by the staff. Face-based attendance is going to be made compulsory for calculating salaries. So staff should follow these rules without fail, the Registrar (in-charge) added in the circular. Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Salem / university",

        "description": "Japanese automaker Toyota introduced plans to cast a futuristic spin on the traditional internal combustion engine",
        "content": "TOKYO (AP) — “An engine reborn.” That's how ese automaker Toyota introduced plans to cast a futuristic spin on the traditional internal combustion engine. During a three-hour presentation at a Tokyo hall Tuesday, the car manufacturer giant announced it would offer lean compact engines that also run on so-called green fuels like hydrogen and bioethanol, or get paired with zero-emissions electric motors in hybrids. This comes as many competitors in the auto industry are pushing for fully electric vehicles. China is revving its push for Battery Electric Vehicles, and its own BYD is threatening to outshine Tesla in that push. Toyota’s Chief Executive Koji Sato said the “engine is optimized for the electrification era” with hopes of helping push the world into “carbon neutrality.” Toyota already has a well-known hybrid car — the Prius — with a gas engine and an electric motor. It switches between the two to deliver a cleaner drive. In future hybrids, the electric motor is set to become the main driving power, and the new engine will be designed to take a lesser role and help it along, according to Toyota. Domestic allies Subaru Corp. and Mazda Motor Corp., both preparing ecological engines designed to meet the inevitably upcoming stringent emissions standards, joined Toyota 's presentation billed as a “multi-pathway workshop.\" “Each company wants to win, but we can be faster if we work together,” said Sato. But details on when the engines were coming to market weren’t disclosed. The legacy of the car engine could be felt everywhere. Mazda said that its prized rotary engine, introduced more than 50 years ago, was being adapted for electric vehicles. Subaru, meanwhile, showcased its trademark smaller horizontally opposed engine. While Chief Technology Officer Tetsuro Fujinuki confirmed the company was working on a great “Subaru-like” electric vehicle, he said the company wasn’t about to dump the engine altogether. Toyota, too, is working on stylish BEVs. The executives said Tuesday that energy supply conditions differed globally, adding that products had to meet various customer needs and the investments needed for mass-producing BEVS were enormous. Toyota officials also repeatedly noted that 5.5 million jobs were at stake in the overall supply chain for vehicle production in Japan nowadays, so a sudden shift to electric cars wasn’t economically possible or socially responsible. Takahiro Fujimoto, a professor of business at Waseda University, believes electric vehicles are a key solution for reducing emissions. But they still have weak points, such as large amounts of emissions produced while making lithium-ion batteries, a chief component. In Japan, for instance, commuters use trains, so that may be a better ecological choice for , Fujimoto said. “At the very least, I believe the proliferation of and innovations in BEVs are definitely needed. But that argument is logically not the same as saying that all we need are BEVs,” he said. Uncertainties remain, spanning research and development, as well as social, political and market conditions, said Fujimoto. “The carbon neutrality the world is aspiring toward isn’t likely attainable for decades to come. It’s going to be a long marathon race,” he said. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on X: https://twitter.com/yurikageyama",

        "content": "Sport | Football Wayne Rooney has said it would be a “dream” to manage Manchester United in the future. The former England captain is back in management after being named the next head coach of Championship side Plymouth Argyle last week. The role is Rooney’s first since he was sacked by Birmingham in January after a disastrous and short-lived reign that lasted less than three months and in which he lost nine of 15 games at the helm of a team that sat sixth when he arrived but were later relegated from the second tier. Before that, the 38-year-old had spells in charge at Derby County and Major League Soccer (MLS) side DC United. Rooney had a glittering playing career, finishing it as England and Manchester United’s all-time record goalscorer, and now he is dreaming of one day taking the reins at Old Trafford. “It’s a tough one because I’ve always said that I’d love to manage Everton or Manchester United,” he said on The Overlap. “I’d probably say United – that would be the pinnacle to manage Manchester United. Everton would be more from an emotional standpoint, a club I support and love, but United would be the pinnacle really.” Rooney was working as a television pundit before taking over at Plymouth and it had been speculated that he would pursue a career in that field instead. The former striker, however, has now revealed how he always wanted to get back into coaching. “Obviously I want to get back into management,” said Rooney, who was speaking before getting the Plymouth job. “It’s something I want to do and prove to myself. The last one, I was disappointed with myself with the results but also with how it ended.” Transfer news LIVE!

        "content": "The US government has donated 85,000 packets of sanitary towels to the Ministry of Education. The donation which was received by Principal Secretary for Basic Education Belio Kipsang, complements the government's sanitary towels programme in retaining female learners in school during their menstrual cycles. \"The donation will help enable female learners in Kenyan primary schools to maintain menstrual hygiene, thereby learning without disruption,\" Kipsang said. Gender and Affirmative Action PS Anne Wang'ombe who was also present during the occasion, said the donation was a symbol that the world is marking Menstrual Hygiene Day. The world marks Menstrual Hygiene Day to break the myths around menstrual cycle. This year's theme, 'Making Kenya Period-Friendly,' underlines the imperative of ensuring every woman and girl can manage menstruation with dignity and safety. Kipsang thanked the US government for the support, saying it adds to Kenya's commitment to fostering an enabling environment where every woman and girl can manage menstruation with dignity and safety. This comes even as the Ministry of Health reaffirmed its commitment to enhancing menstrual health and hygiene nationwide. PS Public Health Mary Muthoni on Tuesday said persisting challenges necessitate sustained support and improvement efforts towards menstrual hygiene. \"Research conducted in 2016 by the ministry highlights significant challenges faced by Kenyan girls and women regarding menstrual health and hygiene,\" Muthoni said. According to the PS, key findings included limited access to menstrual hygiene products. The study found that 46 per cent of girls and women rely on disposable pads with 54 per cent of Kenyan girls having challenges accessing menstrual hygiene products. This has been associated with risky sexual behaviour with some resorting to to unsafe methods or engaging in transactional sex to acquire them. It was also found that poor Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) conditions in schools have made the situation worse, affecting girls' attendance. \"Despite efforts, including the provision of sanitary pads in schools, more than half of menstruating Kenyan girls and women (65 per cent) still lack sustainable access to safe menstrual products,\" the PS said.",

        "description": "Lindsey Goldrick Dean was left terrified after a stranger she met on a dating website subjected her to years of horrific online abuse",
        "content": "A mum has revealed how she was stalked like Donny in Baby Reindeer for 13 years - and praised the Netflix show for its accurate portrayal of the fear she felt. Lindsey Goldrick Dean, 54, was left terrified after a stranger she met on a dating website subjected her to years of horrific online abuse. She had been on several dates with Paul Curran but after telling him she wasn't interested he conspired to make her life hell. Lindsey had a box of ashes delivered to her, 15 “malicious” websites written about her, Twitter accounts impersonating her, her emails hacked, “incessant” phone calls, and visits to her house. The mum-of-one was later awarded an undisclosed sum in damages following a High Court case. Now, Lindsey, from South Somerset, has spoken out about how, as a stalking victim, she greatly related to the hit TV show from comedian Richard Gadd. She said: “I thought it was brilliant the way he did it. He showed everything that we go through, the paranoia, the obsession, the vulnerability. His portrayal was incredible. “I could definitely relate to the emotional toll of the harassment he receives from someone he met in what was an accidental or innocent way and it quickly escalates, which is what happened for me. The emotional and psychological toll that it had on me was very similar. I relate to the searing anxiety and the nightmares, you become hypervigilant and paranoid. I was in fight or flight mode 24/7.” Lindsey, who is a writer, met Curran on a dating site in 2004, and when she ended things after four dates, he continued to stalk her for 13 years. She added: “It was a very scary time. Every knock on the door, every phone call, I thought it was him all the time. So, I didn’t sleep much in those years. “Lots of scary things happened. I’d go to the car and the door would be open and there was a song playing that we had talked about. He wrote 15 malicious websites about me, impersonated me on Twitter, hacked into my email, called me incessantly, sent me boxes of ashes, visited the house. It was a nightmare. He let me know that he was always watching. \"Some of the websites were really scary, he was inviting other stalkers to join him. I felt very isolated and very frightened. He completely hijacked my life and my sense of security. I think it would still be going on now if I hadn’t found my lawyer and taken it to the High Court.\" Curran agreed to pay undisclosed damages and her legal costs following the landmark case at High Court in 2018. But she says she does not feel reassured and would have hoped for criminal charges. She believes the controversial show Baby Reindeer also reflects the lack of support she received from police. She said: “I was glad about the outcome. I had to make him accountable publicly, and to set a precedent in law, to help others. \"But really, I feel he should have been tried in a criminal court and sent to prison for what he did. I don’t feel reassured by it at all, but I have got to get on with my life.\" Speaking about the show and how character Donny is originally fobbed off by a police officer when he reports his stalker, she added: “I totally relate to that too, the challenges with the police. \"They didn't ever take me seriously, always asking what they should do about it. The stalking and harassment continued when I married and had a baby. I continually asked for help. \"They closed my case when there were still ten websites on the internet, he was still impersonating me, I had just complained that there was glass smashed downstairs, and I had just seen his fingers come through the letterbox. Everybody kept turning me away really, they couldn’t help.\"",

        "content": "France is considering a scheme that would penalise fast fashion brands by charging them a fee of up to €10 (£8.50/$11) per item. In March, France’s lower house of parliament approved a bill that would penalise ultra-fast fashion products. The bill, which proposes gradually increasing penalties per item of clothing by 2030, aims to curb the environmental impact of retailers such as Shein and Temu. It would also see a ban on advertising for fast fashion and it will now head to the senate before possibly becoming law. According to , the bill says: “This evolution of the apparel sector towards ephemeral fashion, combining increased volumes and low prices, is influencing consumer buying habits by creating buying impulses and a constant need for renewal, which is not without environmental, social and economic consequences.” Christophe Béchu, France’s minister for ecological transition, wrote on X/Twitter: “The National Assembly has just unanimously adopted a bill to curb the growth of ultra-fast fashion. “I am delighted with this major breakthrough. Today, thanks to the work of [a French National Assembly deputy] and deputies from all political groups, a big step has been taken to reduce the environmental footprint of the textile sector.”",

        "content": "The Twin Cedars Softball Squad still has an aggressive non-conference schedule this summer. The Sabers have already played Wayne, and class 1A top ranked Martensdale-St. Mary’s. They were competitive with those teams, but a win over a non-conference opponent would get far in raising the Sabers’ profile for the postseason. Coach Zack Dunkin tells KNIA/KRLS Sports the Bluegrass Conference games do not always give his team the strength of schedule it needs. Dunkin: “That’s kind of where we have to fill in the schedule. We added Pleasantville and Lynnville-Sully in a triangular so I’m excited about that. When you beat those non-conference teams you have a better chance of being ranked higher in postseason.” Other non-conference opponents include Cardinal, Eddyville-Blakesburg-Fremont...class 2A top ranked Van Meter, and Southeast Warren. The Sabers play Moulton-Udell tonight.",

Advertisement Russia is producing artillery shells faster and at a lower price than Ukraine's NATO allies, a report found. According to an analysis by consulting firm Bain & Company, reported by Sky News, Russia's armaments industry is expected to make or refurbish 4.5 million artillery shells this year. By comparison, the US, the UK, and other European allies are expected to produce 1.3 million this year. This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers.

Related stories It said that while the 155mm shells typically produced by Western countries for Ukraine cost around $4,000 to make, the 152mm shells Russia uses cost around $1,000. Advertisement Bain & Co. reportedly used open-source data in producing the analysis. Business Insider could not independently verify the data. Ukraine's military has been experiencing artillery shortages for months as it battles to prevent Russia from breaking through its defensive lines in east Ukraine. The conflict has developed into a war of attrition, with both sides firing thousands of rounds a day to break down each other's defensive lines. But while Ukraine's Western allies have struggled to keep up with the relentless demand for shells, Russia has placed its economy on a war footing, ramping up its production of shells and other military equipment. Advertisement Images obtained by The Wall St Journal on Monday showed a drone production factory where Russia is aiming to step up its production of the devices. The recent release of a $61 billion US aid bill by Congress is expected to help Ukraine fend off Russia's attacks, but reports say that Ukraine is still being outgunned on key parts of the front line. Stacie Pettyjohn, a military analyst at the Center for a New American Security, told BI recently that the Ukraine conflict had exposed serious problems in the US capacity to produce weapons, ammunition, and artillery. Analysts believe that Russia is gearing up for a war of attrition against Ukraine, in the belief that Western resolve and support for Kyiv will begin to tail off.",

        "content": "As awards season’s Big Topics cement themselves onto schedules the world over, we give marketing leaders a soap box to preach about the other issues that matter. Why is no-one talking about this? Marketers on the under-discussed macro trends this awards season / Israel Palacio via Unsplash The marketing and advertising worlds have officially entered silly season: campaigns and activations dropping all at once, more networking opportunities than even the most dedicated schmoozer could tolerate, and all those big ticket events: Cannes Lions, Advertising Week, and (of course) The Drum Awards for Marketing . Like any year’s events season, this year’s big topics are already seemingly set in stone : AI, first-party data, sustainability. But can the rich variety of a global industry ever be boiled down to just a few on-trend obsessions? Of course not. That’s why we asked marketing leaders from The Drum Network what they’d give their keynotes on if trends were no object. Advertisement Alistair Robertson, creative partner, Nucco: “What should we be talking about? The significant decline – almost crash - in marketing spend. The annual Gartner CMO spend survey revealed that 2024 marketing budgets have dropped to an average of 7.7% of company revenue , a 15% decrease from 2023 and 30% below the 11% recorded in 2020. It’s evidence of what many marketers, agencies and freelancers are feeling: opportunities are scarce. We need to be discussing this because it impacts us all – our career expectations, home lives, mental health, and ultimately our industry’s reputation as an exciting place to grow.” Christopher Edwards, chief executive & co-founder, This is Tommy: “There’s an elephant in the room for agency leaders. The choice between evolving their model to drive growth or stick with selling their time. Our already competitive landscape is getting tougher (commoditization, declining fees, AI rising, the outdated billable hour model). It feels like there’s another problem around every corner. The current labour-based approach has limited our ability to adapt. Agencies are sitting ducks. High client expectations are shrinking margins, endangering creativity and innovation. We need to talk about switching from time-based services to productized value, turning agency expertise into repeatable solutions for high-value problems. Agencies should be sharpening their positioning, helping them to stand out and boost pricing power. Designing repeatable, high-value offerings will build strong client relationships – not something to shy away from. It’s time for agencies to be fairly paid for their expertise. The path we’re on only leads to the bottom.\" Advertisement Dyana So, senior strategist, 160over90: “We need to understand audiences and communities beyond data points, platforms, and generations. Consumers are leaning into traditional marketing categories (gen Z, millennial, boomer), sparking discourse and memes on social media, exasperating generational divides, and challenging arbitrary, demographic tribes. Our interests, lifestyles, fandoms, and rituals define us more than the age groups we’re born into. It’s in these global cultural courtyards where brands should engage them to create meaningful experiences around (and become the focuses within) tentpole marketing events.” Daniel Feuer, creative director, Clickon: “In a world governed by the cold calculations of artificial intelligence, the urgent call for unabashed human storytelling rings louder than ever. Not just any storytelling; the kind that grips you by the soul, shakes you awake, and demands to be heard. Versus AI’s clinical analysis, we need stories that bleed truth, that aren’t afraid to expose the raw, messy reality of human existence. These stories aren’t neat packages of data; they’re visceral, they’re real, and they resonate deep within us. Why? Because in a world where algorithms dictate so much of our lives, we risk losing touch with what it means to be human. We need stories that challenge, provoke, and ignite our empathy. Stories that remind us of our shared struggles, our triumphs, our flaws. Brutally honest human storytelling isn’t just a luxury; it’s a necessity. It’s our lifeline in a sea of artificiality, our beacon of authenticity in a world veiled by algorithms. It’s time to reclaim our narrative and unleash the power of our humanity.” Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.

Eoin Rodgers, chief marketing officer, Atomic: “Today’s B2B buyers are indifferent at best; avoidant at worst. They got overwhelmed. Then they got savvy. What are we going to do about it? The old playbooks don’t cut it anymore. Yet no-one’s talking about the obvious solution. If buyers actively dislike the experiences we’re creating and the rigid journey we’re forcing them along, it makes sense explore alternatives. It’s a buyer’s market. That means it's the buying cycle, not the sales cycle, that matters now. The B2B marketer’s new mission is to make it easier for buyers to buy. And to do that, we need to understand buyers: how they think, feel and act during the buying process. How they would like buying to happen. It’s time to rethink the messages and experiences we create for buyers and stop lamenting the ineffectiveness of the status quo.” Jamie Davies, UK Executive creative director, Momentum Worldwide: “A theme within a theme within a theme: it all sometimes feels like Inception. Can we ever stop obsessing about industry themes? I know it gives us something to either attack or embrace, but let’s look at the trends that should really be macro-mainstays. Like accessible, diverse, and inclusive work that doesn’t feel forced and heavy handed but empathic and authentic, preferably created by the communities featured. Work that highlights world issues, problems, and tough topics – and doesn’t try to thoughtlessly brand them, but co-exists with them to drive scale, innovatively and symbiotically with audience and subject matter. We face the same challenges as always: an often-cruel planet that frequently feels unbalanced and uncontrollable. Tech/AI/new-stuff-that-can-feel-a-little-scary-and-unknown... and things that still need to be sold. We have to provide the insights and create clear, audience-relevant stories with measurable data baked in through. It should matter to us, otherwise we just co-create more white noise... wait, is that a theme?”",

        "content": "QNA GENEVA: Minister of Public Health and Chair of the Executive Board of the World Health Organization (WHO), HE Dr Hanan Mohammed Al Kuwari announced that Qatar will continue to support the work of WHO in 2024 with a voluntary contribution of $4 million. This announcement was made during Qatar's participation in WHO's high-level celebration of its first Investment Round titled \"All for Health, Health for All,\" whereDr Al Kuwari represented Qatar. In her speech at the event,Dr Al Kuwari highlighted that Qatar ranked seventh among member states in contributing to WHO's programme budget for 2020-2021, with a $10 million contribution in 2021. She emphasized that WHO is a key partner for Qatar, as both parties have collaborated on various global, regional, and national health priorities, including health security, the eradication of polio and neglected tropical diseases, advocating for universal health coverage, and responding to humanitarian crises. She reaffirmed Qatar's unwavering commitment to the shared mission of ensuring health for all. She noted that the world today faces increasingly complex and interconnected crises, such as climate change, forced displacement, global health inequalities, economic instability, disease outbreaks, and the threat of future pandemics. The Minister of Public Health explained that WHO, along with member states, has developed the organization's Fourteenth General Programme of Work (GPW 14) for the period 2025-2028, which aims to enhance and ensure health and well-being for all. She added that a new investment case for WHO, outlining the key outcomes of the strategy and the resources needed to implement GPW 14, will be launched during the first strategic roundtable meeting at the 77th World Health Assembly. Dr Al Kuwari stressed that for WHO to fulfill its constitution and implement GPW 14, it needs sustainable and flexible funding. She said that the gradual increase in Qatar's contributions marks a historic step in this direction, but simultaneously, WHO requires greater predictability and flexibility through the voluntary contributions it receives over the four-year period of GPW 14. \"Health care is a fundamental human right and we must continue to invest in the World Health Organization to safeguard our health. Unity is the key to our success,\" she said. The celebration of WHO's first Investment Round saw participation from senior officials from several countries, alongside WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and other WHO leadership.

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the shifting landscape of AI and Big Data, identify which Big Data stocks to sell to avoid falling in the trap of overhyped assets.The post 3 Sorry Big Data Stocks to Sell in May While You Still Can appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Thinking about Big Data stocks to sell might not be the most popular move right now. Especially when we consider the impact of Big Data in artificial intelligence ( AI ), the thought of offloading Big Data stocks becomes doubly difficult. However, the truth is that the AI hype train picked up quite a few unwanted passengers along the way. The slightest mention of AI led to rapid stock market activity last year but market experts expect things to change, predicting a broader market in the near future. Moreover, while some Big Data companies are genuinely leveraging AI effectively, others lag behind, diluting shareholder value in the face of intense competition. With that in mind, it becomes imperative for investors to filter out the noise and dump these stocks to sell offering little upside ahead. MicroStrategy (MSTR) MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR ), traditionally a software company, has shifted its focus these days as a leading Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) holding entity. CEO Michael Saylor has been a vocal advocate for the crypto bellwether, leveraging MSTR’s balance sheet by issuing debt to load up on more BTC. With BTC’s bull run in the past year or so, we’ve seen MSTR stock gain an eye-popping 492% in 2023. Moreover, it has kept up the momentum this year, with year-to-date (YTD) gains exceeding 167%. Needless to say, MSTR is one of the most overheated stocks on the market, trading upwards of 60 times forward sales estimates . Its top brass has placed it in an incredibly precarious situation in the event of a major BTC pullback. This all-in approach may pay off remarkably when all is awesome with the crypto market. However, given the volatility in the crypto and blockchain space, it is perilous to be as recklessly courageous as MSTR’s management. Veritone (VERI) Veritone (NASDAQ: VERI ) has been playing the AI game long before it became the hottest trend last year. It operates an AI-powered platform that helps businesses optimize their data for more effective decision-making. Like many of its peers, Veritone rode the AI wave, boasting a stellar YTD surge of over 69%. Most of those gains were achieved during March and April when its stock shot up from under $2 to $7.76 per share. My fellow InvestorPlace colleague Thomas Niel talked about the run-up in a recent article, pointing out that a short squeeze mainly drove the rally. However, VERI stock hasn’t given its shareholders much to cheer about lately besides the short squeeze. Its business relies heavily on just one client, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), which introduces a dangerous level of customer risk. Moreover, revenue growth has mostly been negative in recent quarters, with it making virtually zero progress in turning a profit . Hence, investors must tread carefully with the stock, especially with the potential for a massive sales decline if Amazon further reduces its engagement. CommVault Systems (CVLT) CommVault Systems (NASDAQ: CVLT ) operates a robust data management platform catering to over 100,000 customers. It benefits from the growing cybersecurity threats and digital transformation, driving demand for powerful data protection solutions. Consequently, it has enjoyed a healthy run-up in value over the past few years, gaining more than 60% in the past year. It now trades at more than 24 times forward cash flow estimates , with many questioning whether the tailwinds propelling the stock are fully priced-in. Moreover, Wall-Street analysts expect an 18% downside in its stock from current levels. Furthermore, the waters are getting choppier for the company with the competition nipping at its heels. Companies like Veeam and Rubrik could take away considerable market share as they gear up for IPOs that could inject new capital and strength into their businesses. Additionally, CommVault is heavily dependent on its partnership with Arrow , accounting for a significant 35% of its revenue base. Hence, with the cybersecurity landscape getting more crowded, price wars and the constant need for innovation could strain CommVault’s resources.

        "description": "NSFAS says that the SIU is helping to terminate the contracts of the four fintech partners hired last year for the direct payment system.The post NSFAS ropes in SIU to fire payment partners appeared first on Hypertext.",
        "content": "NSFAS is finally ready to fire the four controversial fintech partners it hired to support the direct payment system. Administrator Freeman Nomvalo says that the SIU is helping NSFAS with the termination of the contracts. Nomvalo says that NSFAS will be seeking criminal charges for employees implicated in the Werkmans Attorneys report. After nearly a year of controversy, the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) is poised to begin severing ties with its four fintech payment partners for good. NSFAS announced its intent to terminate contracts with eZaga, Coinvest, Narocco, and Tenet Technology nearly 10 months ago following an internal investigation. Now at the end of May 2024, the scheme says it is finally embarking on concrete actions to dissolve these agreements with the help of the corruption-busting Special Investigation Unit (SIU). Previously, the former NSFAS administration said that it was holding off on firing the companies because they were still aiding students with payments, and would only do so before the 2025 academic year. It seems this is no longer the case as the scheme has devised new payment methods for beneficiaries . The internal investigation, published in the Werkmans Attorneys Report, alleged that former officials at NSFAS colluded with two of the four fintech partners and flouted proper tender agreement protocols to sign the companies to multi-million Rand contracts for a job they could not do properly. “I am happy to announce that the process to terminate these contracts has commenced with the filling of the necessary Court papers on the 24th May 2024. In the termination of these contracts, NSFAS collaborated with the Special Investigation Unit (SIU),” NSFAS administrator Freeman Nomvalo told the media on Monday. “Through our lawyers, we have communicated this decision to all the direct payment partners today.” At least two of the providers, eZaga and Tenet Technology told Hypertext at different times that NSFAS had never shown them the Werkmans Report, and insisted up until April that they were still operating based on their mandate with the scheme. “We have made significant progress in subjecting all implicated NSFAS employees in the report to appropriate disciplinary action. Where appropriate, we will also consider laying criminal charges,” added Nomvalo. The top name implicated was former NSFAS CEO Andile Nongogo, who was quickly fired after the report was released. It was alleged that Nongogo had personal ties with eZaga and Coinvest. “eZaga strongly denies any association with or connection to Mr. Nongogo before the tender was awarded,” the company told us via email last year. “eZaga was awarded the tender having met all the necessary tender specifications and has consistently delivered on these requirements.” The four fintech firms were initially onboarded to provide direct digital payments from NSFAS to students in the now-obsolete direct payment system. The system was immediately met with enormous criticism and pushback from students and political organisations after launching in July 2023. Further allegations made in the internal report suggest that the system was rolled out in a rushed manner, without a feasibility study conducted at all to see if the system would even work in the first place. According to the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) , the system would cost the South African taxpayer over R5 billion over five years. It is likely to have only cost NSFAS under a billion Rand since it is now defunct.",

        "content": "Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has dismissed a viral death certificate bearing his name and image as fake. The former governor took to his X platform on Tuesday to clarify that the allegations of having faked his death to escape prison were a smear campaign against him. Sonko faulted his opponents for running the campaigns saying the claims emerged after he clinched the Makadara MP seat. \"Politics is indeed a dirty game!! Faking a death certificate while I am still alive!! All these were mere propaganda, smear campaigns, and diversionary tactics aimed at tarnishing my reputation. \"These tactics began immediately after I won the Makadara by-election in 2011, with the aim of triggering another by-election,\" Sonko said on X. He noted that while he has previously addressed the matter, his detractors have continued to use the same propaganda to make him look bad. Sonko explained that the matter was settled by the courts in an Appeal he filed in 2001. Through the Appeal, he was set free on the offence of escaping from prison. \"I was taken to Kibra Court the same year, and all accusations were proven to be mere propaganda,\" he said. \"The only evidence presented in the escape case was successfully appealed in the High Court's Misc. Appeal case number 80 of 2001, leading to my release from prison.\" The former Governor further warned those still using the issue to tarnish his name that he will not take the matter lightly. \"We can not continue to recycle the same propaganda for over 15 years. It has taken me decades to be where I am today, and I will deal mercilessly with anyone trying to use any method (propaganda or malice) to tarnish my name. \"To those still plotting against me, please apply a new approach, and I will be prepared to defend myself,\" Sonko added.",

        "content": "Big Changes Ahead for Netflix Users! If you’re a Netflix subscriber, there are some significant changes coming your way. The streaming giant, known for integrating innovative features to enhance user experience, is now shifting its focus to bolster its revenue streams. Recently, Netflix initiated a crackdown on password sharing by banning accounts that violated this policy. This measure had a substantial impact on curbing unauthorized account usage, but there’s more to come. Reports suggest that the company is gearing up to remove a key feature from its desktop app. According to sources, Netflix is developing a brand-new Windows app. This app will offer features such as access to AD-Tier plans and live events. However, there’s a catch – users won’t be able to download shows for offline viewing via this new desktop app. Offline downloads will be restricted to mobile devices only. This change could significantly impact how users consume content, particularly those who prefer watching on larger screens without an internet connection. What!??? @netflix is updating its Windows desktop app and “making it better” by removing the ability to download offline. 🤬😤😠 This is how I watch Netflix on the plane. This is a terrible change. pic.twitter.com/8XsiQqNCM7 — Artem Russakovskii (@ArtemR) May 25, 2024 Information about this major change was shared by a user named Artem Russakovskii on X (formerly known as Twitter) this week. He posted a screenshot showing a pop-up message from the app, indicating the upcoming transformation. This has fueled reactions from many users who hope Netflix might reconsider its decision to remove offline viewing from the desktop app. For many, the option to watch downloaded shows on a bigger screen is a favored experience. It’s speculated that Netflix might have conducted research indicating that more users prefer using the offline mode on mobile devices rather than desktops. This might have led to the decision to limit the offline feature to mobile apps only. Nevertheless, with users paying a monthly subscription fee, this sudden removal of a key feature might be seen as an unfavorable move by many. As these changes unfold, Netflix users are left pondering how this will affect their viewing habits and whether their feedback might prompt the streaming service to reconsider the removal of offline viewing from its desktop application. The new Windows app’s full release details are awaited, and users hope it might come with features that compensate for the loss of offline downloads. Stay tuned for more updates on how this overhaul pans out and what it means for the future of content viewing on Netflix’s platform.

        "content": "James Wade has revealed his darts game in the first half of 2024 has been affected by a health scare and his Bipolar disorder. The 41-year-old, a multiple major winner on the PDC circuit, including the 2009 Premier League, 2007 World Matchplay, and UK Open in 2008, 2011 and 2021, was diagnosed with mental health condition Bipolar in 2009 and has learned to manage the symptoms. However, he has struggled with that and an additional health issue of late and won just 11 matches so far this year following his early exit at last weekend's Dutch Darts Championship. Wade, an ambassador for Bipolar UK, told the PA News agency : \"In the last four months I have been up and down with my moods and very chaotic at times. I think I am still there on the chaotic side but my moods seem to have levelled off a bit. \"I've had a tough kind of four months, but that's part of it. And I'm lucky enough now to know how to make the best of it when I'm like that. \"I haven't done anything silly, not upset anyone too much. And I've done all right. I'm quite proud of myself actually. Because for the last four months, I've been feeling pretty low, I would say. I haven't had that killer bit in me, that desire. \"It was a health reason, I thought I had something and I didn't get checked and recently I did get checked and I'm all right, so that's all good. \"I kept it to myself, being silly like men are and I didn't think to get checked for probably two months. Then I told my wife about it and then obviously, she held my hand and booked me an appointment with the specialist. \"I've been catastrophising for the last four months over that until about two weeks ago and that has affected my other bits and bobs around me, definitely.\" Wade's love of buying and restoring old cars has helped him manage his condition. The four-time PDC World Championship semi-finalist added: \"Cars really do take my mind away from it, even though I've obsessed with that at the time. It's one of my escapes, that and fishing are probably the two things that take my mind off things. \"Sadly, I haven't got a decent car at the moment. I haven't got anything that floats my boat or anything exciting. \"I'm not even going to admit to what car I have got because any car fans out there would think I'm not one if I told you what car I'd got. \"I actually mentioned I'd like a new motorbike recently to my wife and she said, 'I think you should need to win some prize money before you think about spending any money on a motorbike'. \"That hurt didn't it?\" Bipolar UK offers support to anyone affected by Bipolar with their free UK-wide services - peer support line, peer support groups and eCommunity - and resources, including their Could it be Bipolar? information and Mood Tracker app.",

It comes after an advert was posted on a 'cruisers' website which named the institution as a meeting spot for casual sex, with a 'vast amount of toilets on site'. According to The Sun, one visitor has complained to the library about the issue, describing the behaviour as 'totally unacceptable'. Security chiefs are apparently aware of students and local workers who have been fooling around in the toilets after arranging hookups online, the newspaper claimed. The library has condemned 'inappropriate behaviour' of any kind and has issued a warning to customers that regular patrols are carried out in the toilets by on-site security staff.

Masari’s arraignment followed his alleged involvement in N119,507,080 money laundering and gratification. When the matter came up on Tuesday, prosecution counsel, Ekele Iheanacho, told the judge of an amended 22-count charge, dated May 13, 2013, and filed on May 17, 2019, which he said, was before the court. Count 19 of the charge reads: “That you Bature Umar Masari between 27th June 2014 and 17th July 2014 at Abuja within the Jurisdiction of this Honourable Court did use the sum of N10,000,000.00 (Ten million naira) paid into your Diamond Bank Plc Account No. 002688674 by Rahuse Ventures Limited when you reasonably ought to have known that the said N10,000,000.00 was proceeds of unlawful activities to wit: conspiracy and gratification and you thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 15(2)(d) of the Money Laundering Prohibition Act 2011 as amended by Act No. 1 of 2012) and punishable under section 15(3) of the same Act.” Count 20 reads: “That you Bature Umar Masari between 14th July 2014 and 21st July 2014 at Abuja within the Jurisdiction of this Honourable Court did use the sum of N10,000,000.00 (Ten million naira) paid into your Diamond Bank Plc Account No. 002688674 by Rahuse Ventures Limited when you reasonably ought to have known that the said N10,000,000.00 was proceed of unlawful activities to wit: conspiracy and gratification and you thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 15(2)(d) of the Money Laundering Prohibition Act 2011 as amended by Act No. 1 of 2012) and punishable under Section 15(3) of the same Act.” The defendant, however pleaded not guilty to all the charges which led the prosecution counsel to apply for a trial date. But defence counsel, Okechukwu Edeze, told the court that the matter was originally before Justice Okong Abang before his elevation to the Court of Appeal. According to him, Justice Abang has on May 24, 2019, granted the defendant bail, adding that since then, he has been enjoying the bail conditions. Edeze prayed the court to allow his client to continue to enjoy the bail earlier granted him by Justice Abang. After listening to all the arguments, Justice O. A Egwuatu released the defendant to his counsel as prayed and adjourned the matter till July 16, 2024, for the commencement of trial.

        "content": "Two video clips reveal some of the shocking illegal activities of a gang of semi-pro footballers, whom police discovered to have a storage unit filled with over £200million worth of cocaine. CCTV shows how the gang members would come and go from the storage unit with drugs concealed in holdalls and boxes. It was found that between 10 April 2022 and 20 October 2022, they had all conspired to supply in excess of 2.7tonnes of high grade cocaine with an estimated street value of £208,160,000 to £260,200,000. Did you know with an ad-lite subscription to Leighton Buzzard Observer, you get 70% fewer ads while viewing the news that matters to you. The second video, recovered from a car, shows Luke Skeete, 36, parking up in his white van and passing over a holdall of drugs. Skeete had been stopped by police in October 2022 as he drove a small panel van. When officers searched it they found 8kg of cocaine in the rear of the vehicle. Advertisement Advertisement Skeete was arrested and a further 123kg of cocaine and 224kg of ketamine was recovered from storage units in west London he had control of. During the course of this investigation Skeete’s phone was seized and sent for specialist interrogation. On it officers found a secure messaging platform and began examining the users. They found each had an individual handle to conceal their true identities and evade police, but after painstaking work they were identified. The group chats demonstrated and evidenced a sophisticated, professional business model the group were operating to supply cocaine through the UK. Adam Pepara, Shaquille Hippolyte-Patrick, Jamarl Joseph, Andrew Harewood, Melchi Emanuel-Williamson, Luke Skeete and Luke Skeete have been sentenced to over 104 years in total. Police Constable Perry, from Specialist Crime North, said: “The operation we’ve dismantled here is not some minor undertaking, involving a group of chancers – this is a highly organised criminal group who were supplying drugs on an industrial scale throughout the UK.” Advertisement Advertisement PC Perry added: “[They] had otherwise promising careers – semi-pro footballers with other jobs and courses they were undertaking – but they were motivated by making money from drugs that fuel misery and violence on our streets.”",

        "content": "Senator Sherwin Gatchalian, vice chairman of the Senate committee on energy, has said that the submission to the Senate of a bill renewing the franchise of Manila Electric Company (Meralco) will be an opportunity to scrutinize the power distributor’s performance. “My view always is that we have to use this opportunity to review the performance of the grantee. And that's a good way of putting accountability on the grantee,” Gatchalian said. “So, I will look at the performance of Meralco. The price, for example, since they buy power, and the service, which includes connection, brownouts, speed of repairing lines, etc.,” the senator said. “For me, I have to look at the performance of Meralco before I can say whether to support it or not.'' House Bill 9813 seeks to extend Meralco’s franchise, which will expire in 2028. “Typically, the franchise emanates from the House,” Gatchalian said. “So, we cannot move until they transmit the franchise to the Senate. So, that's how the process works. So far, no one has filed a franchise renewal with the Senate. But in this case, I think we will have to wait for the House to transmit it to us,'' he added. Consumer groups United Filipino Consumers and Commuters (UFCC) and People for Power Coalition have earlier expressed concern about the early push to renew Meralco’s franchise, four years ahead of its expiry. Meralco spokesperson Joe Zaldarriga said that “as a highly regulated entity, Meralco has always been strictly compliant with the laws and regulations governing its franchise.” \"As such, Meralco is also very cognizant of the rules and has always been cooperative with the legal and regulatory procedures that underpin its operations, the franchise renewal process included,\" Zaldarriaga said. The Meralco official added that the filing of bills to renew its legislative franchise of Meralco is \"a firm validation of the relentless efforts of the power distributor to serve millions of Filipinos.\" Renewing Meralco's franchise, Zaldarriga said, would allow the company's growing number of customers to continue enjoying stable and reliable electricity service, which is vital in powering not just households but also industrial and commercial customers that drive the country’s economic progress. — VBL, GMA Integrated News",

Advertisement A family was kicked off a flight for orchestrating an announcement over their daughter's peanut allergy, according to multiple reports. Georgie Palmer was flying along with her husband and two daughters from London to Dalaman, Turkey, with SunExpress on May 21, when the dispute broke out, according to the MailOnline . Palmer's daughter, Rosie, has a severe peanut allergy that can result in a potentially fatal anaphylactic reaction, she told the outlet. This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . But airline staff refused to make a standard announcement asking other passengers not to eat peanuts. According to an Instagram post seen by the Mail, Palmer took matters into her own hands. Advertisement \"We gently asked the passengers at the front of the plane to share our request,\" she wrote. \"Row by row, as swift as a carefully crafted toppling domino trail, all the passengers turned back to kindly ask the row behind to please not eat nuts on the flight.\" None of the passengers minded at all, she said. But, she told the Mail, it enraged the pilot. She said he began to yell at them and ultimately ordered them to leave. As a result, the family spent around $6,400 booking alternative flights and hotels, she said. In a statement to the Mail, a spokesperson for SunExpress said the airline does not make announcements like this as it \"cannot guarantee an allergen-free environment on our flights.\" Advertisement Passengers have to notify the airline of special requirements 48 hours in advance, the spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement. They said Palmer didn't do that. Palmer, in response, told the BBC that she had tried to make contact but could not reach anyone. Related stories The airline also told the Mail that Palmer's husband, Nick Sollom, was \"aggressive\" to the crew and \"tried to gain access to the cockpit.\" Palmer told the BBC that claim was \"absolute nonsense.\" Advertisement Speaking to the Mail, Sollom said that he knocked on the cockpit door to discuss the situation with the pilot but denied being aggressive. In response to these denials, the airline's spokesperson told BI that it \"stands by what it has said about this.\" The incident highlights the amount of planning frequent flyers with allergies need to undertake, with only a handful of major airlines — including British Airways , Air Canada , Southwest , Delta , and JetBlue making accommodations like this a standard part of their policies. An advocate for people with serious allergies said SunExpress was at fault. Advertisement Nadim Ednan-Laperouse, the co-founder of the Natasha Allergy Research Foundation, said in a post to Facebook that SunExpress should \"immediately\" revisit its policies. \"'Food allergies are an illness not a lifestyle choice, and the experience of this family on board a plane is shocking and unacceptable,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident.\" It's true — SunExpress is far from the only airline that has refused to make the potentially life-saving announcement about allergies. Advertisement Passengers of United and Lufthansa have described unpleasant encounters over the issue. In August last year one allergic passenger resorted to spending $185 to buy her flight's entire peanut supply .",

        "description": "The shadow chancellor said Labour’s manifesto would ‘bear the imprint’ of engagement with businesses.",
        "content": "The shadow chancellor also ruled out holding an emergency budget if Labour won the election, saying she would not hold a fiscal event without a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility – a process that would take 10 weeks. Her statement means that a Labour government would be unlikely to bring forward a budget until at least September, given the timings of parliamentary recesses. Standing in front of two jet engines at Rolls Royce’s plant in Derby on Tuesday, Ms Reeves said her party’s proposals meant there were “no additional tax rises needed beyond the ones I have set out”. The increases already proposed include closing “loopholes” in the windfall tax on oil and gas companies and the Government’s plans to tax non-doms, and making private schools subject to VAT. Ms Reeves also hinted that she would like to cut income tax and national insurance, but would not do so without being able to say how she would fund those cuts. In her speech, the shadow chancellor said Labour was now “the natural party of British business” and promised to lead “the most pro-growth, pro-business Treasury” in the UK’s history, adding that corporation tax would be capped at its current level under a Labour government. Ms Reeves said: “I know there is no policy that I can announce, no plan that can be drawn up in Whitehall, that will not be improved from engagement with business, and our manifesto will bear the imprint of that engagement.” She also sought to emphasise Labour’s dividing lines with the Conservatives, saying her party would fight the election on the economy and blaming “Tory instability” for Britain’s economic situation. Ms Reeves urged voters to “pass judgement” on the Conservatives, saying they had “failed on the economy”. Scores of business leaders have already backed Labour, with 121 executives writing to The Times on Tuesday to declare their support for the party. One of the signatories, Iceland founder Sir Malcolm Walker, publicly backed the Conservatives in 2015 when they were led by then-prime minister David Cameron. The executives said the General Election was a “chance to change the country”, adding: “The UK has the potential to be one of the strongest economies in the world. A lack of political stability and the absence of consistent economic strategy have held it back.” Asked whether her support for business came at the expense of supporting workers, Ms Reeves insisted that Labour was both pro-worker and pro-business, “recognising that you can’t be one without the other”. She added: “You can’t be pro-working people unless you’re pro the businesses that create the jobs and the prosperity to ensure that good jobs are available all across our country. “And you can’t be pro-business unless you’re pro-skilling up and supporting working people to fulfil their potential.”",

ADRIAN LAM, TIMES COLONIST Listen to this article 00:02:50 Neighbours are stepping in to help after thieves stole valuable antiques and ransacked Anne Tolmie’s home in a series of break-ins this past week while she was in hospital with pneumonia. First a cabinet full of antique china was taken and then the mahogany cabinet itself disappeared, along with vintage hats and fur coats, said Dave Chambers, who runs neighbouring Madrona Farm. The 78-year-old Tolmie, who is from the area’s pioneering Tolmie farming family, said Monday that there is “nearly no furniture left” after what she figures were six separate break-and-enters. Glassware and other items are also missing, she said. “Everything that they could possibly trade for money, I guess.” It’s hard to believe what has happened, said Tolmie, who has been battling pneumonia since the end of February. “I certainly was surprised, although I suppose the place looked deserted,” she said. The house is at the end of a hidden driveway, and Chambers said whoever has been breaking in might have noticed signs that it was often empty, like the lack of recyclables in the blue bins. Tolmie has lately been allowed out of the hospital during the day, but said she can’t stay at her home right now because it’s in such rough shape. After she discovered the house had been targeted by thieves, she visited Chambers this past weekend to tell him what had been going on. By the time they got back to the home to check things out, it had been broken into again, Chambers said. “This time they’d broken into the basement and they’d cut her copper water pipes out,” he said. “They’d smashed a hole between the foundation and the house and pulled the pipes out of there.” Chambers said he couldn’t believe the state of the rest of the interior. “It was absolutely ransacked. Every box, every chest, every drawer was on the floor.” The basement windows have had to be boarded up, said Chambers, adding Saanich police have been notified and have been to the home. On Monday, a group of people went to the property to help clean up and found the front door and a sliding glass door were open, Chambers said. Tolmie confirmed it had definitely been locked. “They’d stolen more stuff,” Chambers said. “Basically somebody’s coming in here and ‘mining’ her house.” Friends and neighbours will do what they can to get Tolmie back to her home, he said. “Our goal is to get her house cleaned out and then get her something that she can live in here, like a mobile home, and put a care plan in place so she’s got more protection.” [email protected] >>> To comment on this article, write a letter to the editor: [email protected] See a typo/mistake?

        "content": "The leaders of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Tunisia are conducting a visit to China this week to attend the China-Arab Cooperation Forum, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing announced on Monday. From Tuesday to Saturday, the presidents will “pay state visits to China and attend the opening ceremony of the 10th Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum,” Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement. In comments to Asharq Al-Awsat, diplomats and experts in Chinese affairs said the participation of Arab heads of state was aimed at conveying a message about efforts to strengthen relations with China, which in return is seeking to engage more in political affairs related to the Middle East. According to the Chinese statement, the Arab delegation includes Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, Tunisian President Kais Saied and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. During a press conference, Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Deng Li said China’s President Xi Jinping will attend the Forum and deliver a speech on Thursday, adding that he will hold separate talks with the four Arab leaders to discuss bilateral relations and exchange views on regional and international issues of common interest. Former Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister Ambassador Ezzat Saad told Asharq Al-Awsat that Chinese-Arab relations have witnessed a boom in recent years, specifically since Xi came to power in 2013. “There are about 12 Arab countries that currently maintain comprehensive strategic partnership relations with China,” he said, noting that Chinese investments in Arab countries almost reached $250 billion dollars, while the volume of Chinese trade with Arab countries is close to half a trillion dollars. He interpreted the high-level Arab participation as “a message to the West, reflecting the development of Arab relations with eastern powers, such as China and Russia, in light of those countries’ respect for the United Nations Charter and the rights of peoples to self-determination and non-interference in the affairs of others, in contrast to existing Western double-standard policy.” Asian affairs expert at the Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs Diaa Helmy said China is interested in the region, demonstrated in its involvement in political issues and its effort to create “global balances”, in wake of the war on Gaza and the possibility of its spillover into the region and impacting international trade. China is interested in joining the mediation efforts and help in taking just and urgent decisions to preserve peace and security in the Middle East, he added, noting China’s balanced position towards the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and its support of legitimate Arab rights. The tent camps stretch for more than 16 kilometers (10 miles) along Gaza’s coast, filling the beach and sprawling into empty lots, fields and town streets. Families dig trenches to use as toilets. Fathers search for food and water, while children scrounge through garbage and wrecked buildings for scraps of wood or cardboard for their mothers to burn for cooking. Over the past three weeks, Israel’s offensive in Rafah has sent nearly a million Palestinians fleeing the southern Gaza city and scattering across a wide area. Most have already been displaced multiple times during Israel’s nearly 8-month-old war in Gaza, which is aimed at destroying Hamas but has devastated the territory and caused what the UN says is a near-famine. The situation has been worsened by a dramatic plunge in the amount of food, fuel and other supplies reaching the UN and other aid groups to distribute to the population. Palestinians have largely been on their own to resettle their families and find the basics of life. “The situation is tragic. You have 20 people in the tent, with no clean water, no electricity. We have nothing,” said Mohammad Abu Radwan, a schoolteacher in a tent with his wife, six children, and other extended family. “I can’t explain what it feels like living through constant displacement, losing your loved ones,” he said. “All of this destroys us mentally.” Abu Radwan fled Rafah soon after the Israeli assault on the city began on May 6 as bombardment neared the house where he was sheltering. He and three other families paid $1,000 for donkey carts to take them to the outskirts of Khan Younis, about 6 kilometers (3.6 miles) away, where it took a day living outside before they could assemble the materials for a makeshift tent. Next to the tent, they dug a toilet trench, hanging blankets and old clothes around it for privacy. Families usually have to buy the wood and tarps for their tents, which can run up to $500, not counting ropes, nails and the cost of transporting the material, the humanitarian group Mercy Corps said. Israeli authorities controlling all entry points into Gaza have been letting greater numbers of private commercial trucks into the territory, the UN and aid worker say. More fruits and vegetables are found in markets now, and prices on some have fallen, Palestinians say. Still, most of the homeless can’t afford them. Many in Gaza have not received salaries for months and their savings are depleting. Even those who have money in the bank often can’t withdraw it because there is so little physical cash in the territory. Many turn to black market exchanges that charge up to 20% to give cash for transfers from bank accounts. Meanwhile, humanitarian convoys with supplies for the UN and other aid groups to distribute for free have fallen to nearly their lowest levels in the war, the UN says. Previously, the UN was receiving several hundred trucks a day. That rate has dropped to an average of 53 trucks a day since May 6, according to the latest figures from the UN humanitarian office OCHA on Friday. Some 600 trucks a day are needed to stave off starvation, according to USAID. In the past three weeks, most of the incoming aid has entered through two crossings from Israel in northern Gaza and via a US-built floating pier taking deliveries by sea. The two main crossings in the south, Rafah from Egypt and Kerem Shalom from Israel, are either not operating or are largely inaccessible for the UN because of fighting nearby. Israel says it has been letting hundreds of trucks through Kerem Shalom, but the UN has only been able to collect about 170 of them on the Gaza side over the past three weeks because it can't reach the crossing. Entry of fuel has fallen to about a third of what it was before the Rafah offensive, according to OCHA. That reduced amount has to be stretched between keeping hospitals, bakeries, water pumps and aid trucks working. The American humanitarian group Anera “is having difficulty distributing what we are able to bring in to the people who need it because there’s so little fuel for trucks,” its spokesman Steve Fake said. Most of those fleeing Rafah have poured into a humanitarian zone declared by Israel that is centered on Muwasi, a largely barren strip of coastal land. The zone was expanded north and west to reach the edges of Khan Younis and the central town of Deir al-Balah, both of which have also filled with people. “As we can see, there is nothing ‘humanitarian’ about these areas,” said Suze van Meegen, head of operations in Gaza for the Norwegian Refugee Council, which has staff operating in Muwasi. Much of the humanitarian zone has no charity kitchens or food market, no hospitals operating, only a few field hospitals and even smaller medical tents that can’t handle emergencies, only pass out painkillers and antibiotics if they have them, according to testimony from Mercy Corps. “It’s just a matter of time before people begin to suffer greatly from food insecurity,” the group said. The Muwasi area is mostly coastal dunes with no water resources or sewage systems. With human waste deposited near the tents and garbage piling up, many people suffer from gastrointestinal diseases such as hepatitis, diarrhea, skin allergies, and lice, Mercy Corps said. One aid worker who fled Rafah said he was lucky and could afford to rent a house in Deir al-Balah. “You can’t walk” in the town from all the tents that have arisen, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because his agency had not authorized him to speak. Many people he sees in the street are yellow with jaundice or hepatitis, and “the stench is disgusting” from the sewage and piles of garbage. Israel says its offensive in Rafah is vital to its war aim of destroying Hamas in Gaza after the group’s Oct. 7 attack, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted around 250 others from southern Israel. Israel’s campaign in Gaza triggered by the attack has killed some 36,000 people, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Aid groups have warned for months that an attack on Rafah will worsen Gaza’s humanitarian disaster. So far, Israel’s operations have been short of its planned all-out invasion, though fighting has expanded over the past three weeks from the eastern parts of Rafah to central districts of the city. A strike Sunday hit a tent camp in a western part of Rafah, causing a large fire and killing at least 45 people, according to health officials. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged a “tragic mistake” had occurred. From the exodus the assault has caused, satellite photos taken last week show dense, new tent camps running the length of the coast from just north of Rafah to outside Deir al-Balah. The ramshackle tents and shelters are densely packed in mazes of corrugated metal and plastic sheets, blankets and bedsheets draped over wooden sticks for privacy. Tamer Saeed Abu’l Kheir said he goes out at 6 a.m. every day to find water, usually returning around noon to the tent outside Khan Younis where he and nearly two dozen relatives live. His three children, aged 4 to 10, are always sick, but he said he has to send them out to collect wood for the cooking fire, though he worries they’ll come across unexploded bombs in the wrecked houses. His aging father has trouble moving so has to use the bathroom in a bucket, and Abu’l Kheir has to regularly pay to transport him to the nearest hospital for kidney dialysis. “Wood costs money, water costs money, everything costs money,” said his wife, Leena Abu’l Kheir. She broke down in sobs. “I’m afraid I’ll wake up one day and I’ve lost my children, my mother, my husband, my family.” Relations between the European Union and Israel took a nosedive Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid insisting that sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza's city of Rafah. In tit-for-tat comments and diplomatic actions, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. At the same time, the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including the leaders of the Hamas group. \"The prosecutor of the court has been strongly intimidated and accused of antisemitism — as always when anybody, anyone does something that Netanyahu’s government does not like,\" Borrell said. \"The word antisemitic, it's too heavy. It's too important.\" Angry words abounded Monday, with Katz accusing Spain of \"rewarding terror\" by recognizing a Palestinian state, and saying that \"the days of the Inquisition are over.\" He referred to the infamous Spanish institution started in the 15th century to maintain Roman Catholic orthodoxy that forced Jews and Muslims to flee, convert to Catholicism or, in some instances, face death. \"No one will force us to convert our religion or threaten our existence — those who harm us, we will harm in return,\" said Katz. Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares slammed the comments, and said his colleagues from Ireland and non-EU member Norway were \"also receiving absolutely unjustified and absolutely reprehensible provocations from our Israeli colleague\" because of their plans to recognize Palestine. \"In the face of those who want to divide us with any type of intimidating propaganda, the unity of Europeans is essential to send a very powerful message,\" he said. Even though the EU and its member nations have been steadfast in condemning the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which gunmen stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage, the bloc has been equally critical of Israel’s ensuing offensive that has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. The latest attacks have centered on Rafah, where Palestinian health workers said Israeli airstrikes killed at least 35 people Sunday, hit tents for displaced people and left \"numerous\" others trapped in flaming debris. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said that such strikes will have long-standing repercussions. \"Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,\" he told SKY TG24. The strikes came after the UN's top court, the International Court of Justice, on Friday demanded that Israel immediately halt its offensive on Rafah, even if it stopped short of ordering a ceasefire for the Gaza enclave. Albares said that Spain and other countries asked Borrell \"to provide a list of what measures the European Union could apply\" to make Israel heed the ICJ’s ruling and explain what the EU has done in the past in similar circumstances \"when there has been a flagrant violation of international law.\" Spain, Ireland and Norway plan to make official their recognition of a Palestinian state on Tuesday. Their joint announcement last week triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries' ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Israeli Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and abductions. While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so, and it is unclear how much of a difference the move by the three countries might make on the ground. The recognition, however, is a significant accomplishment for the Palestinians, who believe it confers international legitimacy on their struggle. Albares criticized the treatment of the European ambassadors in Israel. \"We reject something that is not within diplomatic courtesy and the customs of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,\" he said. \"But at the same time we have also agreed that we are not going to fall for any provocation that distances us from our goal,\" he added. \"Our aim is to recognize the state of Palestine tomorrow, make all possible efforts to achieve a permanent ceasefire as soon as possible and also, in the end, to achieve that definitive peace.\" Southern Lebanon, a Hezbollah stronghold, has long been where the Iran-backed Shiite party recruits new members. Since the eruption of the war on Gaza in October and Hezbollah joining the fight against Israel, the party has lost 308 members: 50 from the eastern Bekaa region and rest from the South. The figure reflects the extent to which the residents of the South are involved in this war and have been involved in all wars waged by Hezbollah against Israel from the South. Israel occupied southern Lebanon for years until 2000 so the residents of the area are more involved in the conflict than other people, especially Shiites who live in other regions but who are also supporters of Hezbollah and its ally the Shiite Amal movement. The movement has lost 18 members in the war so far. A study by Information International showed that since the eruption of the conflict in the South and until May 22, the 305 Hezbollah members killed in the fighting hail from 142 cities and villages. The majority, 12, hail from Kfarkila, nine from each of Aita al-Shaab and Markaba, and eight from each of Aitaroun, Blida and al-Tayba. All of these areas are in the South. Fifty-two percent of the dead are aged between 20 and 35. Political analyst and Hezbollah critic Ali al-Amine, who also hails from the South, said the majority of Hezbollah fighters who have been killed in the fighting are from the region. This is primarily because the majority of Shiites in Lebanon are from the South where Hezbollah has heavy military, security and social presence, he told Asharq Al-Awsat. Moreover, the nature of the war does not demand the participation of a large number of fighters. The party is launching rockets, while Israel is retaliating with targeted assassinations and strikes. So, Hezbollah had no need to call up fighters or recruit new ones, in contrast to the war in Syria where it deployed its members more heavily on the ground, added al-Amine. On how much the residents of the South will be able to withstand the human and material losses of the war, he explained that Hezbollah is the ruling security, political and economic authority in the South. The locals have no other side, except for the party, to turn to that can compensate them for these losses. He revealed that relatives of any victim, whether killed or injured, will receive direct compensation of $25,000, a permanent salary, health insurance and other benefits from the party. No one is objecting to this because the relatives would not only have lost their loved ones, but also stand to lose the financial assistance from Hezbollah, he went on to say. Furthermore, al-Amine noted that beyond the relatives of the victims, “Lebanese society is not really concerned with Hezbollah’s fight. The Shiite general public also doesn’t believe that this war represents them.” “They see it as limited to the job Hezbollah has always told them it is carrying out and that is preventing a war and protecting towns from Israeli aggression. However, the opposite is actually happening. Villages have been destroyed and nothing has been protected. Hezbollah became embroiled in a war without taking into account the opinions of the people and their interests,” he stressed. Israel has increased its operations in Lebanon, systematically targeting Hezbollah sites and assassinating field commanders. In response, Hezbollah has attacked key Israeli sites. Both sides have been using new weapons, especially offensive drones, in this ongoing “war of attrition” since October 8. Hezbollah is sticking to the current rules of engagement to avoid a wider war that Israel seems to be provoking. At the same time, Israel has expanded its airstrikes across southern Lebanon, including the outskirts of Sidon and the Bekaa Valley, areas linked to Hezbollah. Recently, an Israeli airstrike in the Zahrani area of Sidon killed a Hezbollah member and two Syrian children. Israel has also increased raids on southern towns like Najjarieh and Adlousieh, which are near Sidon and far from the Israeli-Lebanese border. Israel’s public broadcaster reported that military officials say Iran has provided Hezbollah with advanced air defense systems, based on images from a recently targeted military site. In response, Hezbollah has deployed new weapons to demonstrate its combat capabilities and create a new “balance of terror” with Israel. Hezbollah announced it used an armed drone with two S-5 missiles to attack a military site in Metula, northeastern Israel, before the drone exploded. The group also released a video showing the drone approaching the site, launching the missiles, and then exploding. This introduction of new weapons by Hezbollah doesn’t mean they are preparing to fully open the southern front. Instead, it’s a message to Israel that any military action will be very costly. Riad Kahwaji, Director of the Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis, told Asharq Al-Awsat that Hezbollah has not used all its weapons from the start. Instead, it has set its own rules of engagement, limiting its operations to a specific front with Israel. Kahwaji pointed out that Hezbollah still uses Katyusha and Grad rockets, along with a more powerful modified Grad rocket called the “Burkan.” He added that Hezbollah’s use of tactical weapons, like Kornet anti-tank missiles, is more effective. This is because the damage from Katyusha and Grad rockets is limited due to Israel’s Iron Dome, which can destroy these rockets in the air. Hezbollah is filming its attacks on Israeli sites near the Lebanese border for two key reasons: First, to show its supporters that it can strike back and inflict damage on Israel, responding to the assassinations of its leaders. Second, to psychologically impact the Israeli side. Recently, Hezbollah reported targeting an Israeli military position at Rwaisat al-Qarn in the Shebaa Farms with a guided missile, causing fires at the site. Kahwaji explained that Hezbollah’s use of guided missiles and kamikaze drones has effectively caused Israeli casualties. He added that as targets get closer to the Lebanese border, Israel’s ability to intercept these attacks decreases. The European Union will convene donors next week to keep Syria on the global agenda, but as the economic and social burden of refugees on neighboring countries mounts the bloc is divided and unable to find solutions to tackle the issue, diplomats say. Syria has become a forgotten crisis that nobody wants to stir amid the war raging between Israel and the Palestinian Hamas group and tensions growing between Iran and Western powers over its regional activities. More than 5 million refugees mostly in Lebanon and Türkiye and millions more displaced internally have little prospect of returning home with political stability no closer than since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's rule began in 2011, Reuters said. Funding to support them is dropping with the likes of the World Food Programme reducing its aid. Difficulties to host refugees are surfacing, notably in Lebanon, where the economic situation is perilous and a call to send Syrians home is one of the rare issues that unites all communities. \"We have no levers because we never resumed relations with the Assad regime and there are no indications anybody really will,\" said a former European envoy to Syria. \"Even if we did, why would Syria offer carrots to countries that have been hostile to him and especially taking back people who opposed him anyway.\" Major European and Arab ministers along with key international organizations meet for the 8th Syria conference next Monday, but beyond vague promises and financial pledges, there are few signs that Europe can take the lead. The talks come just ahead of the European elections on June 6-9 in which migration is a divisive issue among the bloc's 27-member states. With far-right and populist parties already expected to do well, there is little appetite to step up refugee support. The conference itself has changed from eight years ago. The level of participation has been downgraded. The likes of Russia, the key actor backing Assad, is no longer invited after its invasion of Ukraine. The global geopolitical situation and drop in the conflict's intensity keeps it off radars. There are divisions within the EU on the subject. Some countries such as Italy and Cyprus are more open to having a form of dialogue with Assad to at least discuss possible ways to step up voluntary returns in conjunction with and under the auspices of the United Nations. However, others, like France which acknowledges the pressure the refugees are weighing on Lebanon and fears broader conflict between Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel, remain steadfast that there can be no discussion with the Assad regime until key conditions are met. DEPORTATION TO EU MIGRATION But the reality on the ground is forcing a discussion on the issue. Demonstrating the tensions between the EU and the countries hosting refugees, Lebanese MPs threatened to reject the bloc’s 1 billion euro package announced earlier this month, slamming it as a “bribe” to keep refugees in limbo in Lebanon instead of resettling them permanently in Europe or sending them back home to Syria. Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, who unlike in previous years is not due to attend the Brussels conference, has said that Beirut would start dealing with the issue itself without proper international assistance. The result has been an upswing in migrant boats from Lebanon to Europe, with nearby Cyprus and increasingly Italy, too, as the main destinations, prompting some countries to ring alarm bells fearing a flood of new refugees into the bloc. \"Let me be clear, the current situation is not sustainable for Lebanon, it's not sustainable for Cyprus and it's not sustainable for the European Union. It hasn't been sustainable for years,\" Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides said this month during a visit to Lebanon. Highlighting the divisions in Europe, eight countries - Austria, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Malta and Poland - last week issued a joint statement after talks in Cyprus, breaking ranks with the bloc's previous positions. They argued that the dynamics in Syria had changed and that while political stability did not exist yet, things had evolved sufficiently to \"re-evaluate the situation\" to find \"more effective ways of handling the issue.\" \"I don't think there will be a big movement in terms of EU attitude, but perhaps some baby steps to engage and see if more can be done in various areas,\" said a diplomat from one of the countries that attended the talks in Cyprus. Another was more blunt. \"Come Tuesday Syria will be swept under the carpet and forgotten. The Lebanese will be left to deal with the crisis alone,\" said a French diplomat. The black mushroom cloud had barely faded in Ghazni province before kids clustered around the edge of the crater created by the mine, one of the devices that kills a child every other day in Afghanistan. Afghans have been able to return to fields, schools and roads since the Taliban authorities ended their insurgency and ousted the Western-backed government in 2021, said AFP. But with new freedom of movement comes the danger of remnants left behind after 40 years of successive conflicts. Nearly 900 people were killed or wounded by leftover munitions from January 2023 to April this year alone, most of them children, according to UN figures. The anti-tank mine had been 100 meters from Qach Qala village, south of the provincial capital Ghazni, since the Soviet invasion from 1979 to 1989. Deminers from the British organization Halo Trust cautiously unearthed then detonated it, the explosion echoing three kilometers (nearly two miles) around. But before it was set off, a Taliban member roared up to the deminers on his motorcycle. “Give me that mine!\" he demanded. \"I'll keep it safe at home. We can use it later when Afghanistan is occupied again.\" The mine couldn't be \"so dangerous since it hadn't exploded all these years\", he insisted, before being pushed back by the deminers. The Taliban government \"is very supportive of demining in this country and wants to conduct clearance as far as it possibly can\", said Nick Pond, head of the Mine Action Section of UNAMA, the United Nations mission in Afghanistan. Demining began in Afghanistan as early as 1988 but, over decades of wars, the country has been re-infested with mines and ordnance. \"It is almost impossible at the moment to predict what the scale of current contamination is,\" Pond told AFP. Eighty-two percent of those killed or wounded by the remnant weapons since January 2023 were children, with half of cases involving children playing. The village of Nokordak, nestled in a bucolic valley, lost two children in late April. Surrounded by her small children, Shawoo told of how her 14-year-old son Javid was killed by unexploded ordnance. \"He threw a stone at it. He hit it once, then a second time. The third time, the device exploded.\" The boy died almost instantly. The same explosion killed Javid's friend Sakhi Dad, also 14. \"People said there were explosive ordnances around, but nothing like this had ever happened in the village before,\" said Sakhi Dad's 18-year-old brother, Mohammad Zakir, a lost look in his eyes. \"No one had come to the village to warn the children of the danger.\" 'Lack of funds' In Patanaye village, 50 kilometers away, 13-year-old Sayed showed his wounded hand and foot, still in bandages after the explosion in late April that killed his brother Taha, 11, as they were tending their sheep. \"Three, four times I pulled it from his hands. I was shouting at him but he kicked me and hit it on a rock,\" Sayed told AFP. These kinds of accidents are all too common, said their father Siraj Ahmad. Tomorrow, \"someone else's son could be killed or handicapped for the rest of their life\", he said. Zabto Mayar, Halo's explosive ordnance disposal officer, said \"lack of funds\" was a major challenge their work. So deminers work painstakingly plot by plot, depending on donations. \"The mine action workforce was once 15,500 people around 2011. It is currently 3,000,\" said Pond. Other global conflicts have pulled funding away, while Afghanistan has also seen donors pull back after the Taliban takeover, their government unrecognized by any other country. Mistaken for gold But Mohammad Hassan, headmaster of a small school in the Deh Qazi hamlet, is still counting on the deminers. \"Even the schoolyard is dangerous for the children because it is not cleared of mines,\" he said. \"We can't even plant trees here. If we dig, if we bring a tractor or machines to work here, it is really dangerous,\" he said. Children in a classroom listened to a lesson aimed at preventing such accidents, the wall plastered with charts of mines or ordnance of all shapes and colors. \"Six months ago on a walk with my friends, we saw a rocket and we immediately told the village elders and they informed the deminers,\" said 12-year-old Jamil Hasan. Mines and ordnance can look like playthings to children, said Pond. The Soviet-era butterfly mine (PFM-1), for example, with its winged shape, \"is very attractive to pick up\", he said. Children are also drawn to the \"beautiful and modern colors\" used in munitions, said Halo unit commander Sayed Hassan Mayar. Some colors are also deceiving, such as golden-topped ammunition that can look like precious metal to people hunting for scrap to sell in the impoverished country. \"The children usually think it might be gold, and they hit it with a stone or a hammer to take the top part,\" Pond said. Danger from remnants of war is also omnipresent for deminers. Halo lost two of their number in early May. \"Sometimes when I go defusing mines, I call my family and tell them I love them, just in case anything happens,\" said Zabto Mayar. Falasteen Abdulati mourns her vanished good life as a wedding photographer as she wearily queues day after day for scarce drinking water in a rubble-strewn street in south Gaza, fearing for the future of her children. The mother of seven is one of over two million Gazans who struggle to survive in the eighth month of an Israeli siege and invasion after the cross-border Hamas attack, with food, drinking water, medical care and safe shelter hard to find. \"I'm a wedding photographer. Someone like me should be going out and living well and spending money on their children,\" Abdulati, 35, said, laboriously filling a few buckets with water from a battered barrel in the city of Khan Younis. \"Our life has (been reduced) to the simplest needs. It is work and exhaustion. Nothing else. The dream that I had as a wedding photographer to open a studio and to get cameras and to make people happy, is lost. My dream is lost.\" She continued: \"Every morning we wake up at 7 o’clock and of course the first thing we think about is water,\" she said, Reuters reported. \"We come here and wait in the long queue, just to fill up four buckets with water. Other than that, our shoulders hurt. There are no men to carry it for us. There is no one but us. Women are the ones working these days.\" Israel's assault on the tiny, heavily urbanized coastal enclave has displaced over three-quarters of the 2.3 million Palestinian population and demolished its infrastructure. \"The future of my children that I worked tirelessly for is lost. There are no schools (functioning), no education. There is no more comfort in life,\" said Abdulati. \"No safety,\" she added, referring to the threat of shelling or raids that Israel says target Hamas militants holed up in densely-packed residential neighbourhoods. Abdulati, dressed in a body-length robe and head-covering, said the upheaval of war had turned the lives of Gaza women upside down. \"Women are now like men. They work hard just like men. They're no longer comfortable at home.\" Her husband is hospitalized with war injuries. Breathing heavily, she lugged her buckets along a shattered, sand-covered street and up a dingy flight of cement stairs into the family flat. There she heated up the fresh water over a makeshift fire stove in a cluttered, cramped room dark for lack of electricity, watched intently by her young children. \"We are suffering due to a lack of gas because the border crossings are shut,\" she said, referring to Israel's siege that has severely restricted humanitarian aid shipments into Gaza. \"The water that I filled up must be rationed. I heat it up so I can wash the children, in addition to doing the dishes and washing clothes. The four buckets I can get per day are just not enough. I have to go back again and again.\" Israel's shutdown and seizure of an Associated Press video camera that provided a live glimpse into Gaza alarmed many journalists, who worried Tuesday about wider implications for coverage of a war largely fought out of the world's sight to begin with. After widespread condemnation, including a call by the Biden administration for Israel to back off, authorities returned the AP's equipment late Tuesday. Israel had justified its move by saying the agency violated a new media law that bans Al Jazeera, since the Qatari satellite channel is one of thousands of customers that receive live AP video. By early Wednesday, the AP’s live video of Gaza was back up in Israel. The camera confiscated earlier, located in the southern Israeli town of Sderot, was not the only one the AP operated in Israel or Gaza — the company would not say how many it uses regularly — nor is the AP the only news organization to do so. Agence France-Presse confirmed it has frequently used such cameras in Israel and also sells its images to Al Jazeera. “Israel's move to restrict AP's work today is extremely concerning and a clear attack on press freedom,” said Phil Chetwynd, AFP's global news director. News organizations expressed worry about the potential ambiguity in how Israel's law could be enforced. What, they asked, prevents Israel from shutting down the news cooperative's operations in the country altogether? “It also could allow Israel to block media coverage of virtually any news event on vague security grounds,” Israel's Foreign Press Association said in a statement. OTHERS ARE LIKELY WATCHING ISRAEL'S ACTIONS Israel also denies foreign journalists entry into Gaza to cover a war that began following Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks inside the Jewish state, and has been criticized for not doing enough to protect Palestinian journalists and civilians. The country “seems to be grasping at anything that hurts Al Jazeera,” said Thomas Kent, former president and CEO of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and an international consultant on media ethics. Its latest step damages a reputable news organization at a time the country would seem to want independent news coverage, Kent said. A democracy acting in this way also sends a disturbing signal to authoritarian countries, he said. “You have to look at the larger picture,” said Kent, also a former standards editor and international correspondent at the AP. “They're giving fuel to other countries that would love to seize equipment and shut down transmissions.” The move against the AP set off a debate within Israel. Yair Lapid, opposition leader to the Netanyahu government, called it an “act of madness.” Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi, who accused the AP of violating the country’s law, said it clearly states that any device used to deliver content to Al Jazeera could be seized. “We will continue to act decisively against anyone who tries to harm our soldiers and the security of the state, even if you don’t like it,” Karhi responded to Lapid on X. The AP's camera in Sderot was operated 24 hours a day and was also attended by staff members. A staffer can be used to move or focus the camera to cover news that may be happening, and also to avoid capturing military moves. The AP says it complies with military censorship rules that prohibit the broadcast of troop movements that could endanger soldiers. STATIONARY CAMERAS ARE COMMON News organizations frequently place cameras that can operate remotely at various places around the globe, either in an area where news is happening or simply to provide a view of a city skyline. These shots have many uses — providing a backdrop for a television station reporting on developments, or as a livestream feature on a website. Earlier in the Gaza war, footage from such cameras helped news organizations conduct forensic investigations into who was responsible for a military strike on a Palestinian hospital. The AP is the biggest supplier of live video news coverage to newsrooms across the world, said AP Vice President Paul Haven, the agency's head of news gathering. “Our live video provides a window of what's happening around the world on any given day, allowing audiences to see events for themselves as they unfold,” Haven said. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it was “deeply disturbed” by Israel's actions on Tuesday. Carlos Martinez de la Serna, CPJ program director, said the country should allow all international media outlets, including Al Jazeera, to operate freely in the country. While Israel's return of the equipment is a positive development, the underlying issue has not disappeared. “We remain concerned about the Israeli government's use of the foreign broadcaster law and the ability of independent journalists to operate freely in Israel,” said AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi's death in a helicopter crash upsets the plans of hardliners who wanted him to succeed Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and will stir rivalries in their camp over who will take over the country when he dies. A protege of Khamenei who rose through the ranks of Iran's theocracy, Raisi, 63, was widely seen as a leading candidate to take over from the 85-year-old Supreme Leader - though it was far from being a foregone conclusion in Iran's opaque politics. His rise to the presidency was part of a consolidation of power in the hands of hardliners dedicated to shoring up the pillars of the Islamic Republic against the risks posed by dissent at home and powerful enemies in a turbulent region. Raisi had enjoyed staunch backing from Khamenei, who had himself held the position of president before he became Supreme Leader in 1989 following the death of the Islamic Republic's founder, Khomeini. The Supreme Leader holds ultimate power in Iran, acting as commander-in-chief of the armed forces and deciding on the direction of foreign policy, defined largely by confrontation with the United States and Israel. While Khamenei has not endorsed a successor, Iran watchers say Raisi was one of the two names most often mentioned, the second being Khamenei's second son, Mojtaba, who is widely believed to wield influence behind the scenes. Raisi, backed by a group that wanted to see him become Supreme Leader, clearly wanted the role, said Vali Nasr, professor of Middle East Studies and International Affairs at John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. \"Now they don't have a candidate, and that opens the door for other factions or other figures to emerge as serious contenders,\" he said. For Raisi, a mid-ranking Shiite cleric, the presidency had been a vehicle to reach the supreme leadership. \"There's no other candidate right now (with) that kind of a platform and that's why the presidential elections in Iran, however they unfold, will be the first decider about what comes next,\" Nasr said. 'BLOW TO THE ESTABLISHMENT' Raisi's views echoed Khamenei's on every major topic and he enacted the leader's policies aimed at entrenching clerical power, cracking down on opponents, and adopting a tough line on foreign policy issues such as the nuclear talks with Washington, two Iranian insiders said. The hardliners maintained their grip in a parliamentary election held in March, but turnout sunk to the lowest level since the revolution. Critics saw this as reflecting a crisis of legitimacy for the clerical elite, amid mounting economic struggles and dissent among Iranians chafing at the social and political restrictions which drove months of protests ignited by the death of a young woman arrested by the morality police in 2022. Though his name has often been cited, doubts have swirled over the possible candidacy of Mojtaba, a mid-ranking cleric who teaches theology at a religious seminary in the city of Qom. Khamenei has indicated opposition to his son's candidacy because he does not want to see any slide back towards a system of hereditary rule in a country where the US-backed monarchy was overthrown in 1979, an Iranian source close to Khamenei's office said. A regional source familiar with the thinking in Tehran said Khamenei's opposition to hereditary rule would eliminate both Mojtaba and Ali Khomeini, a grandson of the Islamic Republic's founder who is based in Najaf, Iraq. A former Iranian official said powerful actors including the Revolutionary Guards and influential clerics in Qom are now expected to step up efforts to shape the process by which the next supreme leader is picked. \"Raisi's death is a blow to the establishment that has no other candidate now,\" the official said, adding that while it was believed Raisi had been groomed to succeed Khamenei, nobody knew for sure what Khamenei's intentions were. UNCERTAINTY IN THE SUCCESSION Khamenei had not been a clear favorite for the role in 1989 and only emerged after backroom dealings among the clerical elite. Under Iran's constitution, the Supreme Leader is appointed by the Assembly of Experts, an 88-member clerical body that supervises and in theory can sack the Supreme Leader. While the Assembly is chosen in an election, another hardline watchdog body comprising clerics and jurists aligned to Khamenei has the power to veto laws and decide who may stand. Two sources familiar with the matter said the Assembly of Experts had taken Raisi off a list of potential successors some six months ago because of his sagging popularity, reflecting economic hardship caused by US sanctions and mismanagement. One of the sources said intensive lobbying had been underway by influential, pro-Raisi clerics to get his name reinstated. The death of Iran's president is unlikely to lead to any immediate changes in Iran's ruling system or to its overarching policies, which are decided by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. But Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash Sunday, was seen as a prime candidate to succeed the 85-year-old supreme leader, and his death makes it more likely that the job could eventually go to Khamenei's son, The AP reported. A hereditary succession would pose a potential crisis of legitimacy for the Islamic Republic, which was established as an alternative to monarchy but which many Iranians already see as a corrupt and dictatorial regime. Here's a look at what comes next. HOW DOES IRAN'S GOVERNMENT WORK? Iran holds regular elections for president and parliament with universal suffrage. But the supreme leader has final say on all major policies, serves as commander-in-chief of the armed forces and controls the powerful Revolutionary Guard. The supreme leader also appoints half of the 12-member Guardian Council, a clerical body that vets candidates for president, parliament and the Assembly of Experts, an elected body of jurists in charge of choosing the supreme leader. In theory, the clerics oversee the republic to ensure it complies with Islamic law. In practice, the supreme leader carefully manages the ruling system to balance competing interests, advance his own priorities and ensure that no one challenges the Islamic Republic or his role atop it. Raisi, a hard-liner who was seen as a protege of Khamenei, was elected president in 2021 after the Guardian Council blocked any other well-known candidate from running against him, and turnout was the lowest in the history of the Islamic Republic. He succeeded Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate who had served as president for the past eight years and defeated Raisi in 2017. After Raisi's death, in accordance with Iran's constitution, Vice President Mohammad Mokhber, a relative unknown, became caretaker president, with elections mandated within 50 days. That vote will likely be carefully managed to produce a president who maintains the status quo. That means Iran will continue to impose some degree of Islamic rule and crack down on dissent. It will enrich uranium, support armed groups across the Middle East and view the West with deep suspicion. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR SUCCESSION? Presidents come and go, some more moderate than others, but each operates under the structure of the ruling system. If any major change occurs in Iran, it is likely to come after the passing of Khamenei, when a new supreme leader will be chosen for only the second time since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Khamenei succeeded the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, in 1989. The next supreme leader will be chosen by the 88-seat Assembly of Experts, who are elected every eight years from candidates vetted by the Guardian Council. In the most recent election, in March, Rouhani was barred from running, while Raisi won a seat. Any discussion of the succession, or machinations related to it, occur far from the public eye, making it hard to know who may be in the running. But the two people seen by analysts as most likely to succeed Khamenei were Raisi and the supreme leader's own son, Mojtaba, 55, a Shiite cleric who has never held government office. WHAT HAPPENS IF THE SUPREME LEADER'S SON SUCCEEDS HIM? Leaders of the Islamic Republic going back to the 1979 revolution have portrayed their system as superior. The transfer of power from the supreme leader to his son could spark anger, not only among Iranians who are already critical of clerical rule, but supporters of the system who might see it as un-Islamic. Western sanctions linked to the nuclear program have devastated Iran's economy. And the enforcement of Islamic rule, which grew more severe under Raisi, has further alienated women and young people. The Islamic Republic has faced several waves of popular protests in recent years, most recently after the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested for allegedly not covering her hair in public. More than 500 people were killed and over 22,000 were detained in a violent crackdown. Raisi's death may make the transition to a new supreme leader trickier, and it could spark more unrest.",

        "content": "For the first time since the 2003-04 academic year, the Central College women’s athletics teams combined to win the Marjorie Giles All-Sports Championship Trophy sponsored by the American Rivers Conference. Central, which sponsors 10 of the 11 women’s sports taken into consideration, totaled 57.5 points to slip past Wartburg College’s total of 56.2. The Dutch men finished third in the Elmer Hertel All-Sports Trophy standings with 50.5 points. Central was second in the Combined All-Sports Trophy. Nine points are awarded in each sport for a conference title, and the points are allocated in descending order so that the last-place team gets one point. In track and field, the outdoor champion gets 6.3 points and the indoor champion gets 2.7 points. Additionally, point totals are lowered for swimming and diving and competitive dance because not all nine conference institutions sponsor those sports. On the women’s side, Central won conference championships in softball and dance and added runner-up efforts in golf and cross country. In total, Central’s women’s teams had eight top-four finishes. On the men’s side, the Dutch did not win a conference title, but had a runner-up finish in cross country and third-place efforts in football, golf and basketball. Central has won the men’s all-sports title 14 times and the women’s all-sports title 10 times.",

Ltd., Hoffmann-La Roche, vTv Therapeutics, AZTherapies, Cerecin, Neurotrope, Lyndra, AC Immune, INmune Bio, Cassava Sciences, EIP Pharma, Neuraly, AB Science, Cortexyme, Anavex Life Sciences, Athira Pharma, Time Therapeutics, Prilenia Therapeutics, Denali Therapeutics Inc., Stemedica Cell Technologies, Inc. and many others. * As per Alzheimer's Disease pipeline analysis, there are currently 150+ companies and 150+ pipeline drugs depicting a pretty fertile picture of the market in the cooking years. * Key Alzheimer's Disease Therapies expected to launch in the market are Lecanemab (BAN2401), Tricaprilin, Aducanumab (BIIB037), Gantenerumab (RG1450, RO4909832), Brexpiprazole (REXULTI / RXULTI), AL002, ALZT-OP1, Brilaroxazine (RP5063), BIIB076, and others. * In 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved lecanemab (Leqembi) for people with mild Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. A phase 3 clinical trial found that the medicine slowed cognitive decline in people with early Alzheimer's disease. * Aducanumab was the first therapy to demonstrate that removing beta-amyloid, one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, from the brain reduces cognitive and functional decline in people living with early Alzheimer's. * In 2023, Eli Lilly announced it had met the primary endpoint in a Phase III study of donanemab, having slowed clinical decline in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) by 35% compared to placebo. As against previously approved anti-amyloid therapies like lecanemab marketed as Leqembi, and Biogen's aducanumab marketed as Aduhelm, donanemab showed higher levels of efficacy indicating another success for those researching Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease Overview Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia, affecting millions globally. It primarily impacts memory, thinking, and behavior, leading to significant impairments in daily functioning. Alzheimer's is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain, which disrupt neuron communication and lead to cell death. The disease typically manifests in individuals over the age of 65, with early symptoms including memory loss, confusion, and difficulty with language. As it advances, symptoms exacerbate to severe cognitive decline, loss of independence, and inability to perform basic tasks. While the exact cause of Alzheimer's remains unknown, risk factors include age, genetics, family history, and lifestyle factors such as cardiovascular health. Diagnosis involves a combination of medical history, cognitive tests, and brain imaging. Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's, but treatments are available to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Medications like cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine can help, alongside lifestyle interventions and supportive care. Ongoing research aims to better understand the disease and develop effective treatments, with hopes of finding a cure in the future.

        "content": "Queen Letizia is 'cold, emotionally immature and passive aggressive' and 'hated' by King Felipe's family, disgraced Spanish journalist claims in bombshell book Jamie Peñafiel's first book on Letizia sent shockwaves through Spain last year Read More: King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia mark their 20th wedding anniversary with new family photos in Madrid By Lydia Hawken For Mailonline Published: 06:52 EDT, 28 May 2024 | Updated: 06:59 EDT, 28 May 2024 e-mail 21 shares 7 View comments Queen Letizia is 'cold, emotionally immature and passive aggressive' and 'hated' by King Felipe's family, a disgraced Spanish journalist has claimed in a bombshell new book. Jaime Peñafiel, 91, was sacked by the Spanish newspaper El Mundo after 20 years earlier this year following the publication of first book on the Queen called 'Letizia & I'. The book sent shockwaves through the Spanish Royal Family after the author alleged that the Queen had a romantic relationship with her ex-brother-in-law Jaime del Burgo. The Spanish Royal Household refused to comment on the claims at the time. Following his dismissal, the veteran journalist has now written another book - called 'Letizia's Silences' - which begins by delving into her early romance with King Felipe. In the opening chapter, the author sensationally claims that 'everything in Letizia's world has been broken' as a result of alleged 'deceit, adultery and betrayals'. Pictured: King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain's official portrait marking their 20th wedding anniversary The author goes on to say Queen Letizia has a 'cold, indestructible and determined' aura about her and that the royal's silence on the recent allegations signify her 'emotional immaturity'. Jaime claims the royal 'resorts to silence as a way of controlling and punishing other people'. He then goes on to claim that Letizia's 'passive aggressive' behaviour towards King Felipe is the reason her 'mother-in-law [Queen Sofia] and sisters-in-laws [Infanta Cristina and the Duchess of Lugo] hate her so much'. In the following chapter, Jaime alleges that King Felipe fell in love with his future wife while watching her present the news. Reports on how the royal couple got together have varied over the years - with some claiming they were introduced at dinner party while others allege they first met when Felipe visited an oil spillage site in Northern Spain. When they began dating, Jaime claims Letizia would 'test' Felipe's feelings for her by travelling frequently. In 2002, the future Queen flew to Santo Domingo to report on the annual Ibero-American Summit - which Jaime describes as Letizia putting Felipe's intentions 'to the test'. Weeks later, the author claims Letizia flew to Costa Rica as a 'strategy' to secure the future King of Spain. Pictured: Queen Letizia of Spain when she was a Television Espanola newsreader. Jaime Peñafiel alleges in his new book that Felipe fell in love with his future wife while watching her present the news Following his dismissal from Spanish newspaper El Mundo, the veteran journalist has now written another book - called 'Letizia's Silences' - which begins by delving into her early romance with King Felipe He explained: 'It was a strategy, because that absence was a real torment for the very much in love Felipe, who conceived distance as the worst of evils, coming to understand [Spanish poet] Lope de Vega when he said that \"the beginning of absence is like the end of life.\"' Following this, Jaime says Letizia was certain of the strength of Felipe's 'total love' for her and returned to Spain 'bossy and manipulative'. What's more, the author claims that Felipe assured Letizia that he could 'cut short' any news outlet reporting on their romance. During one of Felipe's visits to Letizia's Valdebernardo apartment, Jamie alleges that the journalist confided in royal about how she used to work as a cigarette stewardess while living in Mexico. He also predicted the couple, who have maintained what the mainstream Spanish press have described as a dignified silence in the face of ongoing infidelity claims by Jaime del Burgo, would follow in the footsteps of Felipe’s parents Juan Carlos and Sofia. Pictured: King Felipe and Queen Letizia attend the wedding of Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and Daniel Westling in Stockholm in 2010 Spain’s former king is now living in exile in Abu Dhabi after corruption investigations he was caught up in left his reputation in tatters although he returns to his homeland from time to time. Later in the book, Jaime alleges that Felipe and Letizia are living separate lives and 'just keeping up appearances in public' . Following its publication today, Spanish publication El Nacional Cat published a review claiming that Jaime Peñafiel is 'determined to end the Queen's career' and described him as 'one of Letizia's biggest enemies. In 'Letizia & I', the Queen's former brother-in-law Jaime del Burgo makes the unlikely claim that he was planning to propose to Letizia - who was a newsreader at the time - on the night that she told him that she was dating a high-profile man in Spain. Pictured: King Felipe and Queen Letizia and their parents on the couple's wedding day in May 2004 King Felipe's sister Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo (left) and Infanta Cristina pictured attending the Thanksgiving Service for King Constantine of the Hellenes at St George's Chapel Letizia reportedly told him that she had 'met someone who would oblige her to quit her profession', which Jaime said led him to deduce her mystery partner was Felipe. What's more, the royal's ex-brother-in-law also made the far-fetched claim that he 'dealt' with Letizia's pre-nuptial agreement and helped to front the cost of the Queen's family's wedding outfits. He is quoted as saying: 'When the wedding with Felipe came round, I dealt with the pre-nuptial agreement as you know, amongst other things. 'I also had to pay Letizia's family's expenses because [former King] Juan Carlos refused to pay or even go halves with me. So with the help of my friend Felipe Varela, I dressed her mum, grandmother and her sisters. And with the help of Jaime Jason, her father, grandparents and a cousin.' Jaime also makes the incredible claim that the Queen asked to see him the night before the wedding at the exclusive El Latigazo restaurant in Madrid - where she asked him to 'never leave' her. Pictured: Veteran journalist Jaime Penafiel, 91, attends event in Madrid in December 2018. The author has confirmed he is no longer employed by the Spanish newspaper El Mundo Pictured: Queen Letizia's ex-brother-in-law Jaime del Burgo with his ex-wife Telma when they were still married He sensationally claimed: 'When we met, she took hold of my hand and asked me why I had never asked her to marry me. Obviously I didn't reply. I encouraged her as best I could. The last thing she said to me before we said goodbye to each other in that restaurant was a request: 'Never leave me.'' Jaime - who says the Queen nicknamed him her 'yogi pal' - claims he still had a romantic relationship with Letizia even after the wedding in 2004. He also claims he has kept 'photographs, videos, mobile phones' and text messages as evidence. In the book, Jaime sensationally claims that Letizia whispered that she loved him when they were lying in a hammock by a pool at her home following Princess Leonor's birth. Following this, Jaime alleges they 'took steps forward with the goal of being free' - which involved seeking legal advice and looking at properties in the US. One of the most damaging claims Jaime reportedly makes is that Queen Letizia suggested they have a child together using a surrogate in Los Angeles. Around this time, Jaime claims that he confronted Letizia after photos of her kissing Felipe appeared on the covers of Spanish magazines. He claims the Queen told him: 'I had to do it to protect us.' He says in the book Jaime del Burgo told him Felipe and Letizia had a 'difficult relationship' and told him: 'Felipe uses me as a good man because he felt incapable of calming her down.' After Letizia allegedly ended the 'relationship' in August 2011, Jaime claims that a female friend told him to get in touch with the Queen's sister Telma. The following year, the pair got engaged after just two months of dating. However, the couple divorced 2014 following two years of marriage.

        "content": "The undisclosed amount of investment from Zoho will help Yali Aerospace accelerate the development and deployment of its vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) drones Founded in 2022 by husband-wife duo Dinesh Baluraj and Anugraha, Yali Aerospace manufactures VTOL drones to transform healthcare delivery, especially in rural India Yali Aerospace’s current VTOL drone model comes with a 7 kg payload and 150 km per hour range Tamil Nadu-based drone startup Yali Aerospace has bagged an undisclosed amount of investment from SaaS giant Zoho to accelerate the development and deployment of its vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) drones. Founded in 2022 by husband-wife duo Dinesh Baluraj and Anugraha, Yali Aerospace manufactures VTOL drones with an aim to transform healthcare delivery, especially in rural India. The startup also claims to manufacture autonomous docking stations and other drone subsystems, including flight controllers and navigation systems in-house. Speaking to Inc42, cofounder and CEO Baluraj said, “Our motto is to connect all the primary healthcare centres in rural areas to the government hospitals in cities to stop maternity deaths and deaths from snake bites.” With its VTOL drones, Yali Aerospace aims to facilitate long-distance transportation of critical medical commodities such as organs, blood supplies, and other essential medical items. Commenting on the investment, Baluraj said Zoho cofounder Sridhar Vembu visited Yali Aerospace’s facility about four months ago and was impressed with the startup’s potential to leverage technology to transform healthcare services in rural areas. “His (Vembu’s) belief in our breakthrough capabilities is not just an endorsement of our technology but also a strong testament to the potential we hold in making a substantial impact in the healthcare sector,” Yali Aerospace said in a statement. Yali Aerospace’s current VTOL drone model comes with a 7 kg payload and 150 km per hour range. The startup is aiming to start its first pilot project in September this year. Besides, it is also eyeing a Type certification for the drone in the next two months. The investment from Zoho will help it make progress towards this goal as it now needs to ramp up manufacturing to receive the certification. Other than India, Yali Aerospace is also in talks for a few pilot projects in Africa. As per Inc42’s analysis , India is home to over 200 drone tech startups that have together bagged more than 140 Mn in investment since 2014. The Indian drone market is expected to reach $13 Bn in size by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 21% between 2022 and 2030. Usage of drones is increasingly becoming mainstream in the logistics space – from healthcare to ecommerce. Yali Aerospace competes with the likes of Redwing Labs, Skye Air, and others. Meanwhile, the investment by Zoho seems to be a part of the company’s efforts to diversify its offerings. Earlier this year, Zoho launched a new business division, Zakya , in India, to help retail businesses with billing, accounting, ecommerce, mobile billing, mobile store, and back-office tasks.",

Katya has been single since she split from fellow ballroom dancer and Strictly professional Neil Jones , 42, in 2019 after six years of marriage. She was famously caught kissing her partner from the show, Seann Walsh , in an alleyway in 2018. Still single, the pro dancer is now looking into freezing her eggs as she struggles to find Mr Right. She told the Mail On Sunday: 'I'm on Hinge, I've been on Raya , it's all rubbish. It's just s*** chat-up lines. The worst is when they go, \"Oh, can you teach me how to dance?\" That type of thing.

        "description": "Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Limited admits unintentional mistake over complex pricing arrangements",
        "content": "Business The operator of one of Scotland’s largest windfarms in paying over £33 million to regulators after overcharging that pushed up costs for consumers. Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Limited will pay the money into a fund run by Ofgem which provides support to consumers. It comes after BOWL admitted it broke energy market rules by charging excessive prices when it cut its output to keep the electricity grid in balance. Ofgem said: “After engaging with Ofgem, BOWL agreed to make the payment into Ofgem's Redress Fund, which funds projects and schemes to support energy consumers, particularly those in vulnerable situations”, adding: “BOWL has co-operated fully with Ofgem in its enquiries to resolve the issue quickly and fairly. Since Ofgem's review, BOWL has in addition to agreeing to make the redress payment also committed to making changes to its bid pricing policy to ensure a breach does not happen again.” The £2.5 billion Beatrice windfarm is 13 kilometres off the coast of Caithness and has 84 turbines. They can generate enough electricity to power 450,000 homes. Windfarms are an essential part of the transition away from fossil fuels. Pricing arrangements over them are also relatively new. The electricity grid needs to balance supply and demand, and when providers of renewable power are running but their output is not being taken up, complex mechanisms known as “contracts for difference” cover the costs relating to so-called “transmission constraints”. It was in relation to these arrangements that the problems occurred. A BOWL spokesman said today that it “accepts that it breached one of its electricity generation licence conditions,” and that: “The breach was in BOWL’s view wholly unintentional. “BOWL ... has reviewed its bid pricing policy and fully cooperated with Ofgem throughout.” And generators and the regulator are already taking steps to avoid a repeat. “With other industry participants, BOWL is engaging on proposed modifications to the relevant industry code and Ofgem’s ongoing consultation on its approach to interpreting and enforcing the transmission constraint licence condition,” it pledged.

Heat is the leading cause of climate-related death and the report further points to the role of global warming in increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather around the world. For this study, scientists used the years 1991 to 2020 to determine what temperatures counted as within the top 10 percent for each country over that period. Next, they looked at the 12 months to May 15, 2024, to establish how many days over that period experienced temperatures within -- or beyond -- the previous range. Then, using peer-reviewed methods, they examined the influence of climate change on each of these excessively hot days. They concluded that \"human-caused climate change added -- on average, across all places in the world -- 26 more days of extreme heat than there would have been without it\". The report was published by the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, the World Weather Attribution scientific network and the nonprofit research organisation Climate Central. 2023 was the hottest year on record, according to the European Union's climate monitor, Copernicus. Already this year, extreme heatwaves have afflicted swathes of the globe from Mexico to Pakistan. The report said that in the last 12 months some 6.3 billion people -- roughly 80 percent of the global population -- experienced at least 31 days of what is classed as extreme heat. In total, 76 extreme heatwaves were registered in 90 different countries on every continent except Antarctica. Five of the most affected nations were in Latin America. The report said that without the influence of climate change, Suriname would have recorded an estimated 24 extreme heat days instead of 182; Ecuador 10 not 180; Guyana 33 not 174, El Salvador 15 not 163; and Panama 12 not 149. \"(Extreme heat) is known to have killed tens of thousands of people over the last 12 months but the real number is likely in the hundreds of thousands or even millions,\" the Red Cross said in a statement. \"Flooding and hurricanes may capture the headlines but the impacts of extreme heat are equally deadly,\" said Jagan Chapagain, secretary general of the International Federation of the Red Cross. © Copyright AFP 2024.

        "description": "China is initiating a renewed diplomatic effort in West Asia and North Africa to challenge the influence of the United States in the regions. This week, leaders from Egypt, Bahrain, Tunisia, and the UAE will meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing. Discussions are expected to focus on the ongoing war in Gaza. Beijing may also pursue the long-anticipated free trade agreement with Gulf states",
        "content": "Leaders from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, and Tunisia, will visit China this week, according to Beijing’s foreign ministry on Monday. The delegation will include Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Bahrain’s King Hamad, Tunisian President Kais Saied, and UAE’s President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. From 28 May 28 to 1 June, these leaders will “pay state visits to China and attend the opening ceremony of the 10th Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum,” stated foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying. What is the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum? Established two decades ago, in 2004, during a visit to Cairo by then-President Hu Jintao, the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum is a platform that connects China with 22 members of the League of Arab States, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Palestine, Kuwait, and Qatar. Under this mechanism, the foreign ministers of the 23 countries convene every two years to discuss collaboration in politics, economy, and security. In recent years, senior officials have also met periodically to explore deeper cooperation in energy, technology, and public health. The upcoming forum, scheduled for Thursday, will be attended by Chinese President Xi Jinping. China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Mauritanian Foreign Minister Mohamed Salem Ould Merzouk will co-chair the conference. The event will see the participation of foreign ministers or representatives from the Arab states and the secretary-general of the League of Arab States, according to the ministry. Why is China looking to mediate the war in Gaza? Speaking at a briefing in Beijing on Monday morning, China’s Foreign Vice-Minister Deng Li stated that Xi Jinping would hold individual meetings with the four state leaders to “exchange views on bilateral ties and regional and international issues of common concern.” This meetings occur as China aims to mediate the conflict between Hamas and Israel, and the ongoing war in Gaza . Historically, China has supported the Palestinian cause and advocated for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Xi Jinping has also called for an “international peace conference” to address the ongoing violence. “The goal is to end the Gaza conflict as soon as possible and realise peace, and at the same time promote the international community’s determination to implement the ’two-state solution’ with greater determination and more concrete actions to ultimately achieve long-term peace and stability in the Middle East region,” Deng said. In recent years, China has emerged as an increasingly influential force in West Asia, as the United States’ focus has shifted to the Indo-Pacific. The region provides much of the oil that China requires and serves as a major trading partner for many countries in the area, even though the US remains the predominant military and diplomatic power. Beijing maintains strong relations with all key states—Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Israel, and Iran, viewing the region as both a crucial economic partner and a significant geopolitical objective. Last year, Beijing’s growing influence was highlighted when it brokered a peace deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. In June 2023, Xi Jinping welcomed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to Beijing for a state visit and offered to mediate in the Israel-Palestine conflict. In a joint statement following the visit, Xi emphasised that the Palestinian issue has remained unresolved for over half a century, causing significant suffering for the Palestinian people, and stressed that justice must be served as soon as possible. He called for a “large-scale, more authoritative, and more influential international peace conference” to address the issue. Subsequently, Xi also invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to visit China, and Netanyahu expressed his intention to do so . However, the visit has yet to materialise. Also Read : How Chinese mediation into Hamas-Fatah unity talks is part of Beijing’s long-term plan It is evident that Beijing has gained substantial geopolitical influence in the region through its economic ties and various projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Notably, three of its West Asian partners—Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE—are also military partners of the US. Each of these countries has its own reasons for fostering ties with China. One significant advantage for China is its ability to influence Iran, which supports Hamas, and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Will China look to seal a China-Persian Gulf FTA? China may also be aiming to finalise a long-sought free trade agreement (FTA) with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) during the meetings. Negotiations between China and the GCC, which includes the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Oman—all members of the League of Arab States—began as early as 2004. In January, Chen Weiqing, then China’s top envoy to Saudi Arabia, stated that about 90 per cent of the terms of the free trade agreement had been agreed upon. However, two months later, Reuters reported that talks had stalled due to Saudi concerns that inexpensive Chinese products might hinder Riyadh’s ambitions to become an industrial powerhouse. Both the GCC countries and China are among the world’s largest economies. The combined GDP of the GCC countries exceeds $2.4 trillion, while China’s GDP surpasses $17.7 trillion, according to the GCC’s General Secretariat. Trade between the GCC countries and China is robust, with Beijing being the largest trading partner of the Gulf nations. In 2022, bilateral trade volume between the GCC countries and China exceeded $315 billion.

        "description": "People with complex needs are suffering because of 'woefully insufficient' Direct Payments, says Cayce Ibbotson",
        "content": "The mother of a vulnerable son with complex autism has blamed Cornwall Council for failing him and others over \"woefully insufficient\" Direct Payments the local authority provides to families to hire staff to provide care and support. Cayce Ibbotson, who lives in the area, told us she has had an eight-year battle with the council to provide better care for her adult son, who we are calling 'L'. \"He is far from the only person with complex needs in our region who I believe the council is failing to make adequate provision for, including by offering an untenable wage rate for their staffing needs,\" she said. The council says it has developed a new care sector workforce strategy, which will be published in the next few months. It is also commissioning a new service after being told by Cornish families that more support was needed to help manage Direct Payment. A council spokesperson said: \"The strategy specifically recognises that improvements to pay and conditions is a key part of recruitment and retention of the workforce. While funding is currently set at a national level we are working with care providers to make employment in the sector more attractive.\" Cayce said: \"I want to speak out about poor wages within the publicly-funded social care sector in ; specifically about the woefully insufficient, and in the main, arbitrary hourly rate - in the form of Direct Payments. That's the money provides to people, including those with complex needs, to hire staff to provide the care and support they need and which, importantly, the council has a legally enforceable duty to ensure is able to be provided for that sum. \"Currently this is not happening as the hourly rate provided is set at the minimum wage - or, since April 1, less - and, as a result, is almost entirely incapable of attracting any appropriate candidates to the roles required; roles that may literally involve having the lives, safety and wellbeing of the most vulnerable people in our community, with the most complex needs, in their underpaid, understaffed and under-experienced hands.\" Cayce added: \"My son 'L' is one of those people with both significant and complex needs. Two and a half years ago Cornwall Council caused all of his long-term support to be removed while forcing him through a court to try and show he could not make his own decisions about the quantity and nature of his support. Although they failed to do that, they have insisted since that 'L' needs less than a third of the support he originally had despite his needs having increased since, and that it can be sourced and delivered for around minimum wage rates. \"Reality and experience demonstrates otherwise, however, so we have already advised Cornwall Council that if necessary we will pursue Judicial Review proceedings to cause them to properly assess and identify his complex eligible needs. However, meeting those needs now or in the future involves sourcing and retaining sufficient staff to replace those long-term workers lost as a result of Cornwall Council's actions. \"Of course any such staff rightly require a sufficient and appropriate wage that reflects the demanding, skilled and complex nature of the work involved. Yet since that is not on offer it has proved to be impossible to source any - much less any appropriate - staff despite significant efforts including placing adverts in, or engaging with, over 80 public-facing outlets.\" Growing expenditure on adult social care services is the biggest pressure on Cornwall Council's budget. In 2024/25 its spending in that area is likely to exceed £282m, more than a third of its total revenue budget. A Cornwall Council spokesperson said it is unable to speak about individual cases, but did release a statement in response to Cayce's concerns. They said: \"One of our main aims at Cornwall Council is for people to have the right care, in the right place and at the right time and, as part of this, our social work team will assess a person’s eligible outcomes and needs under the Care Act. A person can use a Direct Payment to choose support that assists them to meet their needs. If they choose to have a PA (personal assistant) but can’t recruit one then we would look at whether there are alternative ways in which their needs can be met or check if their funding level was appropriate. \"As part of our work to give people more choice and control over their lives we want to encourage more people to use a Direct Payment so they can make their own choices and commission their own care. This work is being developed in partnership with people who use services who told us that more support was needed to help manage the Direct Payment. Based on this feedback we are in the process of commissioning a new service to provide that support which will be available next year. \"Alongside this we have recently developed a care sector workforce strategy that sets out actions that aim to create good work in the sector. These include the offer of fair pay, secure employment, training, qualifications and career progression opportunities, worker recognition and involvement in decision making. \"The strategy specifically recognises that improvements to pay and conditions is a key part of recruitment and retention of the workforce. While funding is currently set at a national level we are working with care providers to make employment in the sector more attractive. Key to success in this area will be collaborative working and we will be seeking support from local partners, independent sector providers, and other partner agencies.\" Cayce says she would like to hear from any other people in Cornwall affected by the issues she has raised. She can be contacted via email at",

        "content": "By Abdussamad Dasuki Nigeria will record a milestone in its democratic journey on May 29, as it marks 25 years of uninterrupted democracy – the longest since independence in 1960. While the First Republic lasted for six years, and the Second Republic for four years, the Third Republic was aborted as the Presidential election was annulled. As expected, to mark the occasion, drums would be rolled out and dividends of democracy would be reeled out by governments at all levels. But beyond this are salient questions: Is Nigeria working? If not, what system of government will make Nigeria work? On the first question, many would agree that Nigeria is far from where it ought to be in terms of growth and development despite its enormous potentials. At independence, Nigeria, a country blessed with huge human and natural resources, showed promise of a great nation. Apart from solid, liquid, gaseous minerals buried in the ground, the palm oil, rubber, cocoa, timber and the groundnut pyramids, all pointed to the fact that the prospects were great. 64 years after, these great expectations are yet to be met as Nigeria is still battling to resolve some of its teething problems. On the salient question on whether the presidential system of government is working for Nigeria, there is a unanimity of opinion that the system is not working and its imperfections have slowed the pace of Nigeria’s development strides. From the huge cost of governance associated with the presidential system, its slow decision making and implementation pace, and the tendency for the emergence of an all-powerful leader who is neither accountable to the people nor their representatives in the legislature, to the inability to change a bad leader until the next election cycle or through a rigorous removal process, the inherent defects of the presidential system are obvious. Taking cognizance of Nigeria’s chequered history of governance, 60 members of the House of Representatives (well over 60 now) introduced three bills mid-February seeking the alteration of the Constitution for a transition to Parliamentary System. It’s a great privilege for me to be among the sponsors of the bills, comprising lawmakers across party lines and geopolitical zones. We are motivated by our patriotic desires to make Nigeria work for its people and reclaim its glorious destiny as the Giant of Africa and the pride of the black race. We are of the strong view that the best time to hold a national conversation on the system of government that works for Nigeria is now. Gladly, the national conversation has been ignited. Conversations are on going on which system works for Nigeria. We have held consultations with some leaders of thought, former presidents, traditional rulers, and elder statesmen across geopolitical zones. In all the conversations held so far, there is unanimity of opinions that the current system is defective and there is a need to evolve a system that will work for Nigeria. There is also a consensus that such a system must take cognizance of our peculiarity in terms of history, culture and values. There are basically three forms of democratic government systems around the world – Presidential, Parliamentary, and the hybrid system, which contains features of both presidential and parliamentary system. Data has however shown that there are more parliamentary forms of government. In initiating the bills, we recalled that our founders in their wisdom and in a political atmosphere devoid of compulsion, having considered the interests of their native peoples and their desire to live together in a country where truth and justice reign, where no man is oppressed, and where all citizens live in peace and plenty, adopted the parliamentary System of Government. The system lasted till the First Republic was truncated by military coup, following political unrests of the 1960s. The system worked while it lasted, but the six years duration were too short. The collapse of the First Republic led to military rule which lasted for 14 years. The political transition programme of the 1970s midwifed by the military regime introduced the presidential system of government of the American model. The political transition programme culminated in the birth of the Second Republic, which lasted for four years. The collapse of the Second Republic began another epoch of military rule which lasted for 15 years, during which a prolonged transition programme within the first 10 years ended in an aborted Third Republic, an interim government of an appointed civilian leader, and another military era that culminated in the birth of the Fourth Republic in 1999. 25 years of the current democratic dispensation have however shown the shortcomings of the presidential system of government, which include huge cost of governance; excessively powerful presidency wielding fierce influence on the legislature and posing threats to the independence of the judiciary; slow pace of policy formation and implementation; nearly impossible process of removing a bad leader before scheduled elections due to the very rigorous impeachment process; and the fact that cabinet in a presidential system is neither accountable to the people nor to their representatives in parliament, thereby making government less responsive to the resolutions of the legislature and yearnings of the people. Why a home-grown parliamentary system? Firstly, that was the system adopted by our founders, who were consummate nationalists, unhindered in their political thoughts, fearless in the protection of the value system of their various peoples and desirous of building a strong and vibrant nation that meets the aspirations of its citizens. What we are however advocating is a home-grown system that reflects our peculiarities. Secondly, parliamentary system is more effective and efficient because it is not inhibited by checks and balances, which sometimes lead to debilitating gridlocks. That was witnessed extensively in the government of President Olusegun Obasanjo when the legislature and the executive were at loggerheads for most part of the administration on policy direction and budgetary approvals. In parliamentary system, because the members of cabinet are chosen from the legislature, there is better coordination between the two arms, therefore making it easier to pass laws and implement them. Thirdly, the head of government and the cabinet are responsible and responsive because they are accountable to the parliament comprising the representatives of the people. Example of this accountability to the legislature is the prime minister’s questions in nations practising parliamentary system, during which the prime minister answers questions from members of parliament at a specific day of the week. Fourthly, the flexibility associated with the parliamentary system such that the Prime Minister can be removed with a vote of no confidence or a call for early elections, which is more or less a referendum on the government. This helps to guarantee a responsible and responsive government, and prevents the concentration of power in one hand and authoritarianism, unlike the presidential system where such removal can only be through a rigorous impeachment process or in polls held at constitutionally fixed election cycle. Another reason for the endorsement of the parliamentary system is the huge costs associated with the presidential system. For example, an enormous sum of over N300 billion was spent by INEC on the 2023 elections, which included Presidential, National Assembly, Governorship and State Assembly elections. The burden of election costs is not limited to government alone. Candidates and political parties also incur enormous electioneering costs because of the series and scope of elections. In a parliamentary system, nationwide presidential election and state-wide governorship elections are not required because members of parliaments are elected in their various constituencies, and they in turn elect the heads of federal government and the state governments in their respective parliaments, thereby eliminating election costs for that purpose. The past 25 years have shown that a major imperfection of the presidential system is the high cost of governance, particularly in the area of personnel costs of political appointees, leaving fewer resources for other critical sectors. Whereas in parliamentary system, the cabinet is picked from the members of the legislature, thereby knocking off additional personnel costs. One of our intentions is to provoke a national discourse on the governance system suitable for Nigeria. Apart from the consultations held so far, there are plans to consult CSOs, religious leaders, business community and of course the youths. As part of the effective engagement of the youths, the Parliamentary Systems Support group (PSSG) has kicked off a national essay competition open globally to all Nigerian students at any university to discuss the system of government that works for the country. In the present democratic dispensation, two national conferences had been held – One under President Obasanjo government and the other under President Goodluck Jonathan. These conferences confirm that Nigerians believe that the system was not working and there was need to find suitable alternatives. Sadly, the factors that compelled the convocation of the conferences are still on ground. As the national conversation continues, it is not unexpected that the outcome may be a hybrid government system that combines the lessons of our history, the beauty of our culture and the sacrosanctity of our values. May this conversation culminate in the adoption a home-grown government system that works for Nigeria. *Hon. Abdussamad Dasuki, House of Representatives member representing Kebbe/Tambuwal Federal Constituency of Sokoto State, is the spokesman of the lawmakers calling for return to home-grown parliamentary system.",

        "content": "A 56-year-old man from Exeter has been ordered to appear in court after ten giant tortoises were discovered dead in East Devon in January. A total of ten dead tortoises were by police in the Exeter area, sparking an investigation into their cause of death and disposal. Gary Priddle, of Grecian Way, is set to face Exeter Magistrates' Court on Thursday (May 30). He is to face charges under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 and the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Devonlive reported that two bodies were found in Ashclyst Forest near Exeter on Monday, January 8 with a further five found nearby on Friday, January 12. A total of ten Aldabra tortoises have been found since the investigation began. Read more: Priddle faces two charges in court this week. One charge states: \"Between 29 December 2023 and 2 January 2024 at Exeter in the county of Devon threw down, dropped or otherwise deposited litter, namely ten deceased Aldabra tortoises and left it in East Devon, a place to which section 87 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 applied. Contrary to section 87(1) and (5) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.\" Additionally, he faces a second charge which states: \"Between 23 and 29 December 2023 at Exeter in the county of Devon did not take such steps as were reasonable in all the circumstances to ensure that the needs of an animal for which you were responsible, namely ten Aldabra tortoises, were met to the extent required by good practice in that due to not checking on the daily welfare and heating system relating to their care which failed and led to the animals' death. Contrary to section 9 and 32(2) of the Animal Welfare Act 2006.\" ⚠️ Want the latest Devon breaking news and top stories first? Click here to join our WhatsApp group.

        "description": "Airbnb has revealed a selection of Eras Tour-themed stays around the world – and two of them are in London",
        "content": "With the UK-leg of Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour now within touching distance, Airbnb has curated a collection of Swift-inspired stays across the globe. None are directly related to Taylor but each pick embodies one of her albums or represents lyrics from one of her songs to ‘help bring Taylor’s iconic Eras set list to life’. Naturally, most of Airbnb’s picks are based in the US — there’s a four bed in Orlando (‘Florida!!!’), a loft in Manhattan (‘Welcome to New York ’) and a red-painted home in Ohio (‘Red’) — but Swift has plenty of songs featuring nods to the UK . You’ll also find two London addresses on the list. Here are those two: Three-bedroom apartment in Camden – ‘London Boy’, Lover Era Live out the lyrics of ‘London Boy’ and enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon with a stay at this Camden three-bed apartment just around the corner. The pad can fit up to six guests, features on on-site gym and has access to a swanky guest lounge. Airbnb editors wrote: ‘This Camden stay keeps you close to the beating pulse of the electric neighbourhood, and the apartment’s oak, leather, marble and steel finishes promise a refined experience for the modern resident.’ Luxury Riverside Retreat with Stunning City Views – ‘The Black Dog’, The Tortured Poets Department Era If The Tortured Poets Department has quickly become your fave era, you might prefer to stay in this luxury retreat on the River Thames, which happens to be a stone’s throw away from the Black Dog, the pub that gave the title to track 17 on the album . This apartment has two beds that can also sleep up to six guests and offers sweet uninterrupted panoramic views of the river and the city’s skyline. Swiftnation As the Eras tour approaches, cities around the UK have well and truly caught the Swiftie bug. Here in London there are Taylor Swift walking tours and over in Liverpool , the entire city is being transformed into ‘Taylor Town’ .

Kali ini persiapan yang dilakukan lebih matang, yaitu tim medis yang kami kerahkan memiliki sertifikat ACLS, EMT dan sertifikat ATLS. Mobil ambulans yang kami bawa pun dilengkapi alat resusitasi jantung dan paru dengan monitor dan alat defibrillator, kelengkapan P3K dan obat penunjang, alat bantu nafas dan alat mobilisasi pasien, sehingga akan memudahkan jika atlet harus dievakuasi”, tutur dokter Samuel Andika, Residance Medical Officer Emergency Departement SHCB. Menurut Samuel, sejumlah obat penunjang yang dibawa disertakan, mengikuti jenis olahraga yang dilakukan para atlet, dengan melihat kondisi yang ada pada saat itu pun termasuk obat obatan yang sewaktu waktu dibutuhkan masyarakat sekitar yang membutuhkan layanan medis. “Karena ini adalah lomba bersepeda dengan rute jarak jauh yang dilalui dominan berjalur ekstrim maka kami mempersiapkan sejumlah obat, yaitu obat spray untuk keram otot, infus satu set cairan untuk penanggulangan syok dan ada pula obat pacu jantung guna menjaga resiko terjadinya henti jantung”, ungkapnya. Dalam gelaran Cycling De Jabar III, Tim Medis Siloam Hospitals Cirebon menangani enam atlet yang mengalami cidera sepanjang perjalanan. \"Ada yang mengalami cidera akibat jatuh lalu kami tangani hingga dalam kondisi normal. Sebagian peserta lainnya mengalami kram otot dan nyeri. Untuk hal yang fatal, tidak ada. Mungkin karena mereka adalah atlet sehingga stamina mereka secara dominan terjaga dengan baik sehingga hal fatal seperti serangan jantung atau henti jantung mendadak tidak kami temui selama perjalanan,\" tambah Samuel yang ditemani perawat Aziz Alfarizi untuk ikut membantu penanganan kepada atlet yang cidera. Event Cycling De Jabar merupakan kegiatan tahunan berskala nasional.

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter the upcoming Nvidia stock split, shares in this AI top dog could rise by another 50% thanks to the Blackwell chip series launch.The post Double Down on Nvidia Stock Ahead of Its 10-for-1 Stock Split appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Over the past week, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) has hit yet another share price milestone. Thanks to a well received quarterly earnings release, Nvidia stock cracked the $1000 per share mark for the first time. The AI chip winner’s four-digit prices may not last. Luckily, there is no impending correction: Nvidia will split the stock 10-for-1 next month. Pretty soon NVDA will be back at around the $100 per share mark. Better yet, although splits do nothing to make a stock’s fundamentals better or worse, there are unrelated catalysts in play that could drive an additional move higher for shares between now and year’s end. Nvidia Stock, its Recent Earnings Release, and an Upcoming Stock Split On May 22, Nvidia released its fiscal results for the fiscal quarter ending April 30, 2024. For the quarter, year-over-year revenue growth for the AI chip designer came in at a staggering 262% . On a sequential, or quarter-over-over, basis, revenue moved up a steady 18%. GAAP earnings per share came in at $5.98, an increase of 629% compared to the prior year’s quarter, and up 21% on a sequential basis. Alongside yet another quarter of consensus-beating results, management made some other promising announcements. For instance, revisions to revenue guidance for the current quarter ($28 billion) came in ahead of Wall Street forecasts , which prior to earnings were calling for $26.6 billion in revenue this quarter. Nvidia also announced that it was raising its quarterly dividend by 150%. With this plethora of promising news, it’s no surprise that, much as we anticipated , the skeptics were proven wrong. Results failed to fall short of perfection, sending Nvidia stock zooming well past the $1,000 per share mark after earnings. Again though, NVDA is above $1000 per share, but only temporarily. Nvidia announced the aforementioned 10-for-1 stock split alongside results and guidance, with the effective split scheduled for June 7. Two Reasons Why This Latest Rally has Runway As we mentioned above, stock splits have zero impact on fundamentals. However, while a split alone will not make Nvidia more or less valuable, there are two strong reasons the latest NVDA rally could carry on post-split. First, stock splits help to improve liquidity . While the impact of this on highly liquid mega cap Nvidia stock will be marginal, a share price in the low $100s will make it more accessible to retail investors and could provide somewhat of a boost. Second, and more importantly, there are substantive catalysts in motion that could justify additional moves higher for NVDA shares. Currently, the dominant name in AI chips, the company is poised to maintain its dominance. During this quarter and next quarter, high demand for Nvidia’s existing product offerings points to further earnings beats. This could help drive a continued steady climb for NVDA, even if growth begins to slow down on a year-over-year basis. Two quarters from now, however, sales of Nvidia’s Blackwell series of AI accelerators will launch. Sales of these latest, greatest chip products will at point begin to have an impact on revenue and earnings. Blackwell’s debut could even lead to growth reacceleration. The Verdict: With Another 50% Jump Within Reach, Stay Long and Strong With NVDA Sell-side consensus calls for Nvidia’s earnings to more than double this fiscal year, rising by another 29.5% during the fiscal year ending January 2026. However, depending on the success of the Blackwell chips, and the extent in which Nvidia’s sales to non-AI end user markets improve, analysts could soon make upward revisions to these forecasts. Consensus could even rise to where the top end of forecasts are today: $30.35 per share in FY 2025, $47.53 per share in FY 2026 earnings. Slap a low-30s multiple to the FY 2026 forecast, and the prospect of NVDA hitting a pre-split price of $1500, aka a post-split price of $150 per share, is not so far-fetched. With this high level of potential upside within reach, there’s a clear verdict: stay long, and stay strong, with Nvidia stock. Nvidia stock earns an A rating in Portfolio Grader.

        "content": "West Texas Intermediate (WTI), futures on NYMEX, move higher towards weekly high near $79.25 in Tuesday’s European session. The Oil price extends its winning streak for the third trading session as uncertainty among investors ahead of the OPEC+ meeting scheduled for June 2 offsets the impact of easing bets leaned towards the (Fed) reducing interest rates from the September meeting. Investors caution that the Oil supply could reduce further if OPEC members extend the current cut of two million barrels per day. This will uplift the due to supply concerns in an already tight market. Meanwhile, market speculation for Fed rate cut in the September meeting has diminished significantly and investors now expect that centra bank will start reducing borrowing rates in the last quarter of this year. The failure of soft (US) Consumer Price Index (CPI) report of April in building confidence among policymakers that the progress in the disinflation process has resumed after stalling for straight three months has forced traders to pare rate-cut bets. A sharp decline in Fed rate-cut prospects has failed to uplift the US Dollar. (DXY), which tracks the Greenback’s value against six major currencies, extends its downside to 104.40. Going forward, investors will focus on the US core Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (PCE) data for April, which will be published on Friday. The Fed’s preferred inflation measure is estimated to have grown steadily on monthly and annual basis at 0.3% and 2.8%, respectively. This would weaken the case of Fed rate cuts in September further.",

        "content": "Father of Shani Louk reveals he received an envelope containing his daughter's charred jewellery days after IDF troops found her remains alongside other dead Israeli hostages in Gaza raid Nissim Louk said the family had hired a man in Gaza to help find his daughter By David Averre Published: 06:45 EDT, 28 May 2024 | Updated: 07:08 EDT, 28 May 2024 e-mail 1 View comments The family of Shani Louk knew for certain their daughter had died in Gaza when Israeli police handed them an envelope containing the charred jewellery taken from her remains, it has been revealed. The brutal abduction of the 22-year-old German-Israeli tattoo artist from the Nova music festival by Hamas terrorists on October 7 became one of the enduring symbols of the atrocities. Images of her half-naked body being paraded through the streets of Gaza on the back of a pickup truck were ubiquitous in the weeks following Hamas' attacks on Israel, but her father Nissim Louk held out hope she had survived the ordeal. For months Nissim and the family tried to get information out of Gaza, leveraging all their contacts to find a man in the Palestinian enclave to search for Shani and deliver details of her whereabouts and condition. But their hopes were dashed when IDF soldiers discovered human remains that they believed were those of Shani in a nighttime raid on a location in Gaza two weeks ago. Nissim said that a few days later, he knew Shani had been lost for sure when an Israeli police officer delivered the envelope containing his daughter's necklace, earrings, nose and lip piercings, along with documents confirming her death. The brutal abduction of Shani Louk, a 22-year-old German-Israeli tattoo artist, from the Nova music festival by Hamas terrorists on October 7 became one of the enduring symbols of the atrocities Nissim and Ricarda Louk, the parents of Shani Louk, 22 Nissim Louk (L) and Ricarda Louk attend the funeral service for their daughter Shani Louk during her funeral service on May 19, 2024 in Srigim-Li On, Israel Palestinian militants drive back to the Gaza Strip with the body of Shani Louk, a German-Israeli dual citizen, on October 7 Shocking footage shared on social media showed Palestinian fighters parading Shani's naked body on the back of a pick-up truck Nissim and Ricarda Louk, the parents of Shani Louk, 22, who was taken hostage by Hamas after being seized from the Nova festival, following a deadly infiltration by Hamas gunmen from the Gaza Strip into Israel, and who was later confirmed dead by Israel's government, are photographed in their home in Srigim-Li On, Israel Nissim told The Telegraph how he immediately recognised Shani's dreadlocks and tattoos from the images of her on the back of a Hamas pickup truck. 'We didn't see any blood on that white truck so we thought, maybe she's OK,' he said. But with Hamas providing no confirmation of his daughter's condition, Nissim turned to desperate measures. Contacting relatives in Germany who were able to connect with Palestinian acquaintances, Nissim managed to get in touch with an elderly Gazan who agreed to work for the family and help dig for information on Shani's whereabouts. The man provided scant details, but claimed to have seen WhatsApp messages between Gazan medics allegedly describing their care for a 'German girl' - a description Nissim believed was likely in reference to his daughter. Earlier this month, Nissim said the family had 'hoped, planned, prayed' for Shani's safety and were 'looking for clues to prove she was alive.' But their prayers went unanswered. Nissim recounted how IDF officers came to the house and explained how troops conducting a raid in Gaza had come across human remains. The officer said skull fragments retrieved at the scene appeared to match Shani's DNA, suggesting she had suffered a fatal injury. Inside, along with some paperwork, lay a blackened chain necklace, a couple of gold earrings and studs from Shani's nose and lips. Shani's body was in the forest near their home on May 19 in a touching ceremony attended by dozens of mourners. Nissim Louk reacts during a funeral service for his daughter Shani Louk on May 19, 2024 in Srigim-Li On, Israel A drone view shows mourners during the funeral of German-Israeli Shani Louk, who was killed in the October 7 attack by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, in Srigim, Israel, May 19, 2024 Atim Louk (L) was among the pall bearers carrying the casket of his sister Shani Louk on May 19, 2024 in Srigim-Li On, Israel Shani Louk is pictured with Oryon Hernandez Radoux, who was also abducted and later found dead in Gaza Shani Louk and Oryon Hernandez Radoux It was revealed by IDF officials that Shani's remains were found alongside the bodies of two other hostages - Itzhak Gelerenter, 57 and Amit Buskila, 28. All three attended the Supernova festival near kibbutz Re'im on October 7, one of the first sites to be attacked by Hamas on its deadly incursion into Israel . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the deaths of the three revellers 'heartbreaking,' adding: 'We will return all of our hostages, both the living and the dead.' Late last week, IDF troops working with members of Israel's Shin Bet security service launched a similar raid and retrieved the remains of three more hostages. Hanan Yablonka, Michel Nisenbaum and Oryon Hernandez-Radoux were abducted from the Supernova music festival and the Mefalsim intersection just one mile away from the Gaza border on October 7, and were subsequently murdered by Hamas, Israeli officials said. Hernandez-Radoux, 30, was Shani's boyfriend. Both had shared pictures together on social media in the days and weeks prior to their abduction. Shani was seen dancing at the Nova Festival near kibbutz Re'im hours before Hamas gunmen flooded across the border on October 7, 2023. Earlier this month, Nissim spoke out in defence of the award given to an AP photographer who captured the chilling moment the half-naked body of his 22-year-old daughter was paraded across Gaza by Hamas. His remarks come after friends said they were shocked that the photograph had won the prestigious award and were in tears. Shani was one of the roughly 1,200 people killed on October 7 by Hamas Shani with her mother Ricarda (pictured, left) Shani Louk and Oryon Hernandez Radoux The decision to award AP photographer Ali Mahmud the oldest photojournalism gong by Reynolds Journalism Institute after he placed first in 'Team Picture Story of the Year,' sparked outrage. The photo depicts five armed Hamas members in a pickup truck, one of whom is resting his feet on Louk's limp body. Further footage shows the terrorists parading her body in Gaza amidst cheering crowds with one spitting on her remains. But Nissim said: 'It's good that the photo won the prize'. 'This is one of the most important photos in the last 50 years,' he told Ynet. He expressed a firm belief that his daughter's photograph will leave a mark on human history, considering it a symbol of the current era and hopefully serving as documentation for generations to come. 'These are some of the photos that shape human memory, the Jew raising his hands, the paratroopers at the Western Wall, photos that symbolise an era,' he continued. 'This documentation of Shani, and of Noa Argamani on the motorcycle, they symbolise this era. I think it's a good thing to use it to inform the future.' 'If I start crying, what will come of it? This is history. In 100 years they will look and know what happened here. I travel the world and everyone knows who Shani is,' he told Ynet. But Shani's mother Ricarda said she was horrified by the picture , saying it forced her and her family to relive the trauma of losing their loved one.

        "content": "McLaren has made a string of new board appointments which include the former head of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, Torsten Muller-Otvos. Muller-Otvos was brought in earlier in May as the British supercar maker looks to turn around years of losses in the post-Covid era. The Rolls veteran was the stately brands longest-serving leader and was credited with spearheading its transformation into the super-luxury sector. He will be joined on the board by Pier-Yves Roussel, chief executive of the American luxury brand Tory Burch, and Dennis Nobelius, a former executive at Volvo, according to Companies House filings. The top brass shake-up comes at a critical point in McLaren’s road to recovery. Last year, it reported a record loss of over £870m, an increase of 160 per cent as it was forced to rely on shareholders for extra cash. But after completing a recapitalisation of its balance sheet, McLaren’s top shareholder, Bahrain’s sovereign wealth fund Mumtalakat, took full ownership of the group in March. It could mark the start of a new chapter for the firm, which was put at risk of collapse in 2022 by the global shortage of semiconductors. The deal was hailed as a “major milestone” at the time and came alongside an £85m cash injection. McLaren Group then reported reported its best quarter in half a decade over the first few months of March, boosted by a near quarter jump in car sales. Following the chip shortage crisis, delivery delays of its next-generation hybrid Artura supercar had further impacted the bottom line. In 2020, McLaren agreed to sell its famous Formula One headquarters in Woking to raise cash as it underwent a major restructuring that saw it cut over 1,000 jobs. Its subsidiary McLaren Automotive has become a huge player in the market for prestige sportscars in the last 14 years. McLaren has been approached for comment.",

        "content": "Joe Wicks, famous for getting the country moving during the Covid lockdowns with his ‘PE with Joe’ videos on YouTube, visited Tudor Academy to encourage the mental and physical benefits of movement and exercise. Tudor Academy was one of the few schools selected from the 17,000 applications from across the country to be a part of the tour. Wicks was greeted at the school entrance by the current Pupil Prime Minister, Elizabeth, the school’s previous and current Equalities Ministers, Myla and Shalis, and one of the school’s leading football stars, George. Wicks then led the entire pupil body and every single staff member through a series of fun and interactive workouts, emphasising the importance of staying active and making fitness enjoyable. From high-energy cardio routines to strength-building exercises, Wicks demonstrated that getting fit can be both accessible and exciting for people of all ages. Pupils were delighted as Wicks led the active session on the school’s field site and brought flags and banners they had made to celebrate and express their excitement. Beyond the physical aspects, Wicks also shared invaluable insights on mental well-being, in a Q&A that followed the workout. Pupil representatives from reception through to Year 6 asked Wicks questions about his approach to fitness, what is important to him now, and how he became a fitness instructor. This day came after a series of outstanding sporting achievements at Tudor Academy, including the Year 5 and 6 Football team winning the F.A Croydon’s School Football League for New Addington, and the Year 4, 5 & 6 mixed-gender Basketball team winning their round in the first annual iBall Croydon Basketball competition, receiving silver medals in the final. Joe Wicks, Fitness Coach and Presenter, said: “The school tours are the highlight of my year and visiting Tudor Academy was absolutely fantastic. “It was great to see all the pupils engaged and happy to be moving and learning about the benefits of physical activity. “I saw first-hand the academy’s dedication to supporting its pupils to make healthy choices. “Thank you to Donna Rochford and all the pupils at Tudor Academy for their warm welcome and for asking me such great questions on a very memorable day.” Donna Rochford, Headteacher at Tudor Academy, said: “It was a privilege to host Joe Wicks at our school to experience his dynamic approach to physical activity. “The entire school community was ecstatic to be one of the few schools chosen to be part of the tour, with one pupil telling me she was so happy on the day she could cry. “We are committed to ensuring our pupils lead happy and healthy lives, which is why sports and physical activity are such important elements of our school life. “I hope our pupils will continue to be inspired by Joe and his positive and inclusive attitude to exercise and physical movement. “Thank you, Joe, for an unforgettable day at Tudor Academy.”",

        "content": "SINGAPORE: Less than a week after Singapore Airlines flight SQ321 was forced to make an emergency landing in Thailand due to sudden and severe turbulence that left one dead and dozens injured, another incident of turbulence made the headlines. A May 26 Qatar Airways flight from Doha to Dublin fell hundreds of feet suddenly, causing injuries to twelve passengers and crew members on board, eight of whom were brought to hospital upon landing in Ireland. Due to both incidents, many are turning their eyes toward global warming as one of the causes of severe turbulence, which, as recently demonstrated, can prove deadly. A passenger on another recent SIA flight recorded his experience with turbulence. Scientists started sounding the alarm about the link between climate change and turbulence nearly a year ago. In June 2023, researchers from the UK’s University of Reading published a study showing how turbulence—especially clear air turbulence, which is more difficult for pilots to detect and avoid—has increased as the planet has warmed up. For example, on one busy route in the North Atlantic, turbulence increased by 55 per cent between 1979 and 2020 while global warming accelerated. “Following a decade of research showing that climate change will increase clear-air turbulence in the future, we now have evidence suggesting that the increase has already begun. We should be investing in improved turbulence forecasting and detection systems to prevent the rougher air from translating into bumpier flights in the coming decades,” said Prof Paul Williams, one of the study’s co-authors. Since turbulence is associated with weather events, the more severe the weather, the more turbulence can be expected. The study also found that the more greenhouse gas emissions, the warmer the planet gets, which translates to increased incidents of turbulence and instability. Prof Williams has also said that severe turbulence turns people who do not wear seatbelts into projectiles. “For anyone not wearing a seatbelt, it would have been a bit like being on a rollercoaster without any restraint in place — it would have been terrifying.” Prof Mark Prosser, who also authored the study, said that global warming may cause instability in the jet stream. “Planes like to fly with the jet stream, but where planes like to fly is also ironically where all the turbulence is,” he said . On Sunday, US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg called the effects of climate change on different forms of transportation “a reality” that is “already upon us.” Noting that there has been a 15 per cent increase in turbulence, he said that protocols for dealing with them should be re-evaluated “in the face of the reality that these things are more frequent and more severe than before.” /TISG Read also: ‘I honestly thought we were going to die’ — Passenger says on flight that returned to Singapore after extreme turbulence",
