        "content": "VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran's attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to have economic sanctions imposed over the country's controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing the program down. The program — as all matters of state in Iran — are under the guidance of Iran’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and that likely won’t change in the wake of last week's helicopter crash that killed Iran's president and foreign minister. The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency also comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Israel and Iran have carried out direct strikes on each other’s territory for the first time last month. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said that as of May 11, Iran has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report by the U.N. watchdog in February . Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Also as of May 11, the report says Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6,201.3 kilograms (1,3671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1,489.8 pounds) since the IAEA's previous report. IAEA’s definition says that around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further, to 90%. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi , has previously warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the U.N. agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. Under the original nuclear deal, struck in 2015, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. The 2015 deal saw Tehran agree to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for generating nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At the time, U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. Monday's report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar IAEA inspectors from further monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.” According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran's decision to bar inspectors — and a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.” The deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA's talks with Tehran over improving cooperation, the report acknowledged. Before the May 19 helicopter crash, Iran had agreed to hold technical negotiations with IAEA on May 20, following a visit by Grossi earlier in the month. But those meetings fell apart due to the crash. Iran then sent a letter on May 21, saying its nuclear team wants to continue discussions in Tehran \"on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon,” the report said. The report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA's years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. It said the IAEA’s request need to be resolved, otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations\" under a safeguards agreement between Tehran and the nuclear watchdog. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA said that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.”",

The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. 14-time champion Rafael Nadal loses in the French Open's first round to Alexander Zverev PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That's why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he isn't 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. He reiterated that Monday. He said after his match, \"If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself.” Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. Kyle Larson's bid to run The Double ends in disappointment after bad weather intervenes CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only the single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s goal to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday and join Tony Stewart as only drivers to complete all 1,100 laps did not go nearly as planned. He finished 18th at Indianapolis after a pair of rookie mistakes. He arrived in Charlotte to run the NASCAR race but never got to turn a lap after the race was ended early because of rain. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving each score 33 points as Mavs beat Wolves for 3-0 lead in West finals DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving scored 33 points apiece and the Dallas Mavericks made all the big plays late again, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-107 for a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference finals. The Mavericks went on a 14-3 run to finish the game, winning their fifth consecutive playoff game. No team in NBA playoff history has rallied from 3-0 down. Game 4 is Tuesday night in Dallas. Anthony Edwards had 26 points for the Wolves, but just four after scoring eight consecutive Minnesota points to get the Wolves even in the third quarter. Braves' Ronald Acuña is placed on IL after second season-ending knee injury in 4 years ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves have placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list after the reigning NL MVP tore his left ACL, ending his season. Acuña was hurt during the Braves’ 8-1 win at Pittsburgh on Sunday. The Braves announced Sunday night an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require surgery. Acuña tore his right ACL in July 2021. Acuña was voted the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases. Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris played Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev and lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. Wennberg scores in OT, Rangers top Panthers 5-4 to take lead in East finals SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Alex Wennberg deflected home a goal 5:35 into overtime, and the New York Rangers reclaimed home-ice advantage in the Eastern Conference finals with a 5-4 win over the Florida Panthers in Game 3 on Sunday. Ryan Lindgren took a shot from the left point and Wennberg — in front of the Florida net — redirected it past Sergei Bobrovsky to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead in the series. Igor Shesterkin made 33 stops, while Alexis Lafrenière scored two goals and Barclay Goodrow continued his surprising playoff barrage with two more scores for the Rangers. Sam Reinhart had two power-play goals, while Aleksander Barkov and Gustav Forsling also scored for the Panthers. Christopher Bell wins the rain-shortened Coca-Cola 600 for his 8th NASCAR Cup victory CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Christopher Bell won the Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday at Charlotte Motor Speedway after the race was called with 151 laps remaining in a race that was halted for more than two hours because of rain. Bell led a race-high 90 laps to win his eighth career Cup Series race, and his first Coca-Cola 600. Brad Keselowski finished second, William Byron was third, Tyler Reddick was fourth and Denny Hamlin rounded out the top five. The race was red-flagged just as Kyle Larson arrived at Charlotte Motor Speedway from the Indianapolis 500 to take over driving the Hendrick Motorsports’ No. 5 Chevrolet. As Dallas competes for NBA and NHL crowns, the Texas Rangers are struggling with their title defense The Texas Rangers host the Arizona Diamondbacks this week in a rematch of last year’s World Series. Both teams are under .500, costing the matchup some of its luster. For the Rangers, injuries to prominent starting pitchers are just part of the problem. Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer haven’t pitched at all this year. Nathan Eovaldi and Jon Gray are on the injured list now as well. Despite all that, Texas’ starters have an ERA of 3.65. But the bullpen has the second-worst ERA in the game at 5.09.",

They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. Wennberg scores in OT, Rangers top Panthers 5-4 to take lead in East finals SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Alex Wennberg deflected home a goal 5:35 into overtime, and the New York Rangers reclaimed home-ice advantage in the Eastern Conference finals with a 5-4 win over the Florida Panthers in Game 3 on Sunday. Ryan Lindgren took a shot from the left point and Wennberg — in front of the Florida net — redirected it past Sergei Bobrovsky to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead in the series. Igor Shesterkin made 33 stops, while Alexis Lafrenière scored two goals and Barclay Goodrow continued his surprising playoff barrage with two more scores for the Rangers. Sam Reinhart had two power-play goals, while Aleksander Barkov and Gustav Forsling also scored for the Panthers. Christopher Bell wins the rain-shortened Coca-Cola 600 for his 8th NASCAR Cup victory CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Christopher Bell won the Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday at Charlotte Motor Speedway after the race was called with 151 laps remaining in a race that was halted for more than two hours because of rain. Bell led a race-high 90 laps to win his eighth career Cup Series race, and his first Coca-Cola 600. Brad Keselowski finished second, William Byron was third, Tyler Reddick was fourth and Denny Hamlin rounded out the top five. The race was red-flagged just as Kyle Larson arrived at Charlotte Motor Speedway from the Indianapolis 500 to take over driving the Hendrick Motorsports’ No. 5 Chevrolet. As Dallas competes for NBA and NHL crowns, the Texas Rangers are struggling with their title defense The Texas Rangers host the Arizona Diamondbacks this week in a rematch of last year’s World Series. Both teams are under .500, costing the matchup some of its luster. For the Rangers, injuries to prominent starting pitchers are just part of the problem. Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer haven’t pitched at all this year. Nathan Eovaldi and Jon Gray are on the injured list now as well. Despite all that, Texas’ starters have an ERA of 3.65. But the bullpen has the second-worst ERA in the game at 5.09.",

        "description": "Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal...",
        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. While Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site. Monday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2009, and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately. “To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,” he explained, “you need to be playing often.” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” This story has been corrected to fix the year of Nadal's loss to Soderling. It was 2009, not 2010. AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately. “To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,” he explained, “you need to be playing often.” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — Catch up on the French Open with a guide that tells you everything you need to know about what happened at the clay-court Grand Slam tennis tournament, how to watch it, what the betting odds are, what the schedule is and more: Who is Playing on Monday? The match getting by far the most attention — Rafael Nadal vs. Alexander Zverev — will be third in Court Philippe Chatrier. That means it should start at around 3:30 p.m. (1330 GMT; 9:30 a.m. EDT). That will be preceded by No. 8 Ons Jabeur against Sachia Vickery, which starts play in the main stadium at noon (1000 GMT; 6 a.m. EDT), and the second match there, with Iga Swiatek against Leolia Jeanjean. Another match that could generate interest will be Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, who is coming off a hip injury, against Chris Eubanks, a big-serving American who reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals last year. That starts the day in Court Suzanne Lenglen at 11 a.m. (0900 GMT; 5 a.m. EDT). What Happened on Sunday? Two-time major champion Carlos Alcaraz pronounced his recently injured forearm “fully recovered,” even if it still is “feeling weird,” after overwhelming J.J. Wolf 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 in the first round. “It's still in my mind, but I didn’t feel anything after the match ... which is really, really good for me.” Four-time Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka won a match at a major for the first time in more than two years by defeating Lucia Bronzetti 1-6, 6-4, 7-5, to advance to what could be a second-round showdown against Swiatek. Other players moving into the second round included Caroline Garcia of France, 2020 Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin, No. 30 Dayana Yastremska and Donna Vekic in the women's draw, and No. 6 Andrey Rublev, No. 8 Hubert Hurkacz and No. 10 Grigor Dimitrov in the men's. No. 17 seed Ugo Humbert was eliminated by Lorenzo Sonego 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3. There was a brief rain shower in the afternoon, which delayed action on several courts but allowed for the first use of the new retractable roof at Court Suzanne Lenglen. How to Watch the French Open on TV — In the U.S.: Tennis Channel, NBC, Peacock. — Other countries are listed here . Betting Guide Nadal is usually favored to win the championship at the French Open — he has 14, after all — but BetMGM Sportsbook has him as the underdog in the first round against No. 4 seed Zverev on Monday. Zverev is a -350 money-line favorite against Nadal, who is listed at +260 for that match. Nadal is just 7-4 this year and missed nearly all of last year while dealing with injuries; that is why he is unseeded and so could have been drawn to face anyone to begin the tournament. Zverev was a semifinalist in Paris each of the past three years and is coming off a clay-court title at the Italian Open this month. Swiatek is a big favorite to win the title (-155), so it makes sense that she is listed at -10000 against Jeanjean, who has +1600 money-line odds for their match.

        "content": "Members of American Legion Post 38 place a wreath near the flag pole at the Mill Springs National Cemetery. The placement of the wreath was part of Monday's Memorial Day services. The dedication of those who have served our country and who have since passed away – in wartime and in times of peace – was honored Monday in a gathering at Mill Springs National Cemetery in Nancy. Those who wanted to pay tribute the men and women who served in the U.S. Military joined American Legion Post 38, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the members of the National Parks Service who oversee the Mill Springs Battlefield and Visitors Center in remembering all those who have gone before us. The ceremony was conducted as part of Memorial Day activities being held at both the National Cemetery and the Civil War-era battlefield. “Hundreds of thousands of Americans have died in preserving liberty and peace for our nation,” said main speaker Allen Boone, retired lieutenant colonel of the U.S. Army. LTC Ret. Allen Boone speaks to the crowd during Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony at Mill Springs. “The Civil War alone had over 700,000 men and women who died in service. Their sacrifices are etched in history, a solemn testament to their bravery and dedication. These men and women understood the meaning of putting others before self. They were dedicated to fulfill their mission at all costs. And as we ponder their sacrifices, our hearts should be filled with gratitude for their willingness to serve against foreign and domestic enemies who sought to destroy our nation,” Boone said. Boone himself has served in active duty, having been in two tours of duty in Iraq. Boone, who currently lives in Lexington, has a masters degree in Management and Leadership from Liberty University and is a graduate of Command and General Staff College. “This day is not just about a day of remembering,” Boone said. “It is time for us to act. As we honor their memory, we pledge that their lives, that their sacrifices, that their valor shall never be forgotten. Let us also pledge to do the utmost and carry out what must, and what they wished for us, in that no other generation of young men and women would have to share their experiences and repeat their sacrifice.” Clarence Floyd, American Legion Post 38 Chaplain, leads the crowd in prayer during Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony at Mill Springs National Cemetery. As part of Monday’s ceremony, American Legion Post 38 Chaplain Clarence Floyd led the crowd in a prayer, in which he said, “As we look across, and as we see all these white markers, Lord, we know that was one of our brothers or sisters, but Lord, they also had a family, and we pray for every one of them and for the life that they lived and for the influence they had on other people.” The ceremony proved bittersweet for Floyd, as he announced he would be retiring as chaplain soon, after 17 years of service with Post 38’s Color Guard. The Color Guard itself bookended the service, by both leading the opening parade which presented the colors, and by completing the service with a 21-gun salute and the playing of Taps. Members of the American Legion Post 38 Color Guard present the colors during the opening parade to Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony. Also during the ceremony, a commemorative wreath was placed at the cemetery’s flag pole, near the grave of Sgt. Brent Woods, a Buffalo Soldier who received the Congressional Medal of Honor after an event in August 1881 in which he saved the lives of his fellow soldiers.",

        "description": "Former South African President Jacob Zuma is the wild card in Wednesday’s election for Africa’s most advanced country. He leads a new political party that's draining support from the ruling African National Congress that he once said would rule until...",
        "content": "DURBAN, South Africa (AP) — The 59-year-old Dumisani Ndlovu has voted in every South Africa national election since he and the rest of the Black majority finally won the right 30 years ago. He has faithfully supported the liberation party-turned-ruling party African National Congress every time. That ends on Wednesday. In a way, nostalgia is calling. Ndlovu in this week's election is turning his support to the man, Jacob Zuma , whose career spanned from the liberation struggle to the presidency before falling out with his ANC colleagues and reemerging last year with a new political party . That MK party, named after the ANC's old armed wing, shows how the 82-year-old Zuma is leveraging the past to rally South Africans' support against the ANC, which he himself once claimed would rule until “Jesus comes back.” Here in the heartland of Zuma supporters, the eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, cab driver Ndlovu has embraced the unlikely comeback of a political survivor after years of corruption allegations, criminal charges and prison. Even being barred from this election as a candidate for Parliament over a recent conviction hasn't blunted Zuma's influence. “They think they have finished him, but we are with him all the way. The ANC will pay,” Ndlovu said. It is a rallying cry that could, for the first time, force the ANC into a coalition to stay in power. The new party is fielding other candidates for Parliament and appears likely to win seats. Zuma has become the wild card of the election for Africa's most advanced country, six years after resigning South Africa's presidency under a cloud. His MK party was formed just over six months ago and yet is expected to drain significant support from the ANC, which already faced its sternest test. Zuma's credentials — he was in prison alongside Nelson Mandela for his work in the anti-apartheid movement — resonate especially in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal. Ndlovu, the cab driver, had backed the ANC since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994. Now, one of his grievances against the ANC is what he calls its ill-treatment of Zuma. “He went to jail during apartheid and then they (the ANC) put him in jail again despite all his sacrifices. What kind of freedom is that?” Ndlovu said. Zuma was sent to prison in 2021 after refusing to testify at an inquiry looking into alleged corruption in government during the time he was president from 2009-2018. He called that sentence an effort by the ANC to silence him. Zuma said last week's Constitutional Court decision to disqualify him from standing as a candidate was part of a grudge against him by the ruling party and the courts. The constitution doesn't allow anyone to stand for election if they have been sentenced to 12 months or more in prison without the option of a fine. “I am going to fight for my rights until this country agrees that freedom must be a complete freedom, not for some and oppression for others,” Zuma said. He now fights under the banner of the MK, which he has fashioned as the vanguard of anti-apartheid struggle ideals such as the distribution of land to Black people. The party’s symbol is similar to the old ANC military wing’s logo. Its full name is uMkhonto weSizwe, which means Spear of the Nation. The ANC took MK to court over its use of the name, which it claims it owns. MK won. It was another example of the ANC trying to silence him, Zuma said. Zuma's new party also looks to the future, promising jobs, free education and better healthcare for young people who make up the majority of the country’s population. They have no memory of apartheid, but they have plenty of grievances about the deep inequality that remains. Zuma claims to be a truer version of the ANC and more dedicated to helping South Africa’s poor Black majority. His party's branding has been welcomed by supporters for its anti-apartheid nostalgia. “I have known uMkhonto all my life. It fought for freedom. It is there for us again this time,” Ndlovu said. How such loyalty — and the ANC's irritation over it — might translate into votes will be seen on Wednesday. “It might just make people want them (MK) more because the question that arises is, why put so much push against this party? There must be there something, and I think people are intrigued and they might just go out and vote for them,” Sanet Madonsela-Solomon, a lecturer in the department of political sciences at the University of South Africa, told TV station eNCA this week. At MK's last major campaign rally over the weekend in KwaZulu-Natal, gray-haired men and women in military fatigues joined youthful supporters sporting skinny jeans and manicured nails. Together, they danced to old anti-apartheid struggle songs that evoked the hardships of that period. They praised late ANC icons like Mandela and criticized current ANC leaders. “uMkhonto is not for the people of KwaZulu-Natal only, it is a calling for South Africa as whole,\" said one attendee, Siboniso Gwala. “The spear is what will liberate this country. uMkhonto will liberate Black people.” His 6-year-old son, Nkanyezi, was in tow, singing along and wearing a beret with MK’s symbol — a warrior with a spear and shield.

        "content": "Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris played Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev and lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. ‘Furiosa’ sneaks past ‘Garfield’ to claim No. 1 spot over Memorial Day holiday weekend Furiosa won the holiday box office over Garfield by a hair. It was a close race, but the wasteland warrior of “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga” came out slightly ahead of the plump orange cat with an estimated $32 million in ticket sales over the four-day weekend according to studio estimates Monday. “The Garfield Movie,” a Sony release, earned $31.1 million in its first four days. This weekend has also been a sobering one for Hollywood as one of the worst Memorial Day weekend box office showings in decades and the gap may only get bigger. Heat-related monkey deaths climb in Mexico, as environmentalists report deaths of birds and bats MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. And an animal park confirmed around a hundred parrots, toucans, bats and more have died apparently of dehydration in northen Mexico. Last week, environmentalists reported 138 of the midsize primates were found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco. The Environment Department reported that number had risen, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. A wildlife biologist said it appeared to be heat stroke. The department said 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released. Chasing cheese wheels or lugging sacks of wool, UK competitors embrace quirky extreme races LONDON (AP) — Dairy-loving daredevils have thrown caution to the wind for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. In Monday's event, dozens of reckless racers chased 7-pound (3 kilogram) wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill since at least 1826. In the nearby town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds (27 kilograms) up and down Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972. They draw on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town. Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. 14-time champion Rafael Nadal loses in the French Open's first round to Alexander Zverev PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That's why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he isn't 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. He reiterated that Monday. He said after his match, \"If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself.” Grayson Murray's parents say the two-time PGA Tour winner died of suicide Grayson Murray’s parents say their 30-year-old son took his own life. Murray died on Saturday, one day after he withdrew from a PGA Tour event at Colonial. Eric and Terry Murray are asking for privacy and that people honor Murray by being kind to one another. His death comes at a time when Murray appeared to be on track with his life and his golf. He has been open about his struggles with mental health and alcoholism. He said when he won the Sony Open in January that he had been sober for the last eight months. Former 'General Hospital' actor Johnny Wactor killed in downtown Los Angeles shooting LOS ANGELES (AP) — Former “General Hospital” actor Johnny Wactor was shot and killed when he interrupted thieves stealing the catalytic converter from his car in Los Angeles. Police say the shooting occurred around 3 a.m. Saturday when the victim approached three men in downtown LA. His mother, Scarlett Wactor, tells ABC 7 that her 37-year-old son had left work at a rooftop bar with a coworker when he saw someone at his car and thought it was being towed. Scarlett Wactor says a mask-wearing suspect looked up and opened fire. Police say three suspects drove away from the scene. Wactor was rushed to a hospital, where he died. 12 people injured after Qatar Airways plane hits turbulence on flight to Dublin LONDON (AP) — Twelve people have been injured when a Qatar Airways plane flying from Doha to Dublin hit turbulence. Dublin Airport said in a statement that the plane landed safely as scheduled before 1 p.m. Sunday. It said six passengers and six crew members reported injuries after the aircraft experienced turbulence while airborne over Turkey. The airport said all passengers were assessed for injuries aboard the plane, and eight were then taken to hospital. The incident comes five days after a British man died of a suspected heart attack and dozens of people were injured when a Singapore Airlines flight from London hit severe turbulence. Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. to miss the rest of the season after tearing his left ACL PITTSBURGH (AP) — Atlanta Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. will miss the rest of the season after he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during an 8-1 victory at Pittsburgh. The reigning NL MVP led off the game with a double to right-center field off Martín Pérez. With Marcell Ozuna at the plate, Acuña started toward third on a stolen base attempt and his left knee gave way. Acuña remained down for several minutes while being treated, pointing at his left leg before walking off under his own power. The Braves’ initial diagnosis was left knee soreness. But the team announced later that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery.",

Acuña remained down for several minutes while being treated, pointing at his left leg before walking off under his own power. The Braves’ initial diagnosis was left knee soreness. But the team announced later that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery.",

        "description": "Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal...",
        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. While Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site. Monday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately. “To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,” he explained, “you need to be playing often.” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

        "content": "DALLAS — A year ago, Anthony Edwards sat silently at his locker after Minnesota went down 3-0 to Denver in the first-round series and stared into the mirror before eventually getting up and walking out without saying a word. Two days later, he scored 34 points on the strength of five three-pointers to lead the Timberwolves to a Game 4 victory over the Nuggets. The win, the only victory of last year’s playoffs for Minnesota, had meaning to Edwards. ADVERTISEMENT “I don’t ever want to say I got swept in my career,” he said. Mike Conley sat at his locker after Minnesota’s dramatic Game 7 victory in Denver in the Western Conference semifinals, and was asked, “What’s next?” Conley secured his first career playoff sweep in Round 1 against Phoenix. He notched his first Game 7 victory in Denver. Surely, there was another box to check on the horizon. The veteran point guard’s answer: “Win a conference finals game.” ADVERTISEMENT Conley’s goals are certainly higher than that; the 36-year-old point guard yearns to win an NBA championship before he hangs up his sneakers. But it’s well documented by now that this is Conley’s second conference finals appearance – and first since 2013. And his team in 2013, the Memphis Grizzlies, was swept by San Antonio that season. An identical exit would likely cut a little deeper 11 years later. No NBA team has ever rallied from a 3-0 deficit in a best-of-7 series in 154 tries — and both the Wolves and Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals find themselves in such a hole. So no, it’s not likely Minnesota will reel off four straight victories to reach the franchise’s first NBA Finals. Though, hey, who knows? But just nabbing a win Tuesday in Game 4 would mean something. It would mean no sweep of Edwards. It would mean another small career achievement for Conley. It would also mean Minnesota gets to fight another day. ADVERTISEMENT That’s the Wolves’ plan. “I just told them to keep fighting. We fight. We’ve been fighting all series, and we’re not going to stop fighting,” Wolves coach Chris Finch said. “We’ll look at it, we’ll build it back up and we’ll be ready to go on Tuesday, and see what happens from there.” It’s true, the Wolves have been resilient all year. Whenever a player went down, another stepped up. When a deficit grew, the Wolves responded and rallied. Lest we forget the defending NBA champions led Minnesota by 20 points on their home court in the second half of a Game 7, and the Wolves still won. ADVERTISEMENT Perhaps the team that has routinely set new franchise marks will achieve an NBA first, as well. One thing is for sure: If the Wolves go down, it will be swinging. “If (there’s) a team that can do it, I think it’s us. We’re built to do that,” Wolves forward Naz Reid said. “Everybody still got their heads up. You don’t want to go down 0-3, but it’s part of life. We’re not going to hang our head about it. We’re going to go out there and fix it.” It’s worth a try. ADVERTISEMENT “We ain’t got nothing else to do,” Edwards said. “We can’t do nothing but be positive at this point. We can’t be negative. Just try to get it one win at a time.” ______________________________________________________ This story was written by one of our partner news agencies.

He also analysed the roadshows by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and CM Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata. With a massive roadshow in Kolkata, Prime Minister Modi is expected to mount a last-ditch effort in the Bengal elections—this will be his final face-to-face meeting with Mamata Banerjee. The \"Bangalir Mone Modi\" roadshow will travel through important historical sites. Modi will travel in a hi-tech bulletproof car, showcasing a grand spectacle of Bengali culture. The theme of Modi’s roadshow, ‘Bangalir Mone Modi’, translates to ‘Modi is in the heart of Bengalis’. The Prime Minister’s 2-km roadshow will commence from Vidhan Saryan of Shyam Bazar and conclude at Swami Vivekananda’s house. This route holds historical significance as it was frequently used by Swami Vivekananda to visit his Guru, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa.

Mamata Banerjee, on the other hand, has been seen to strategically position her campaign events to coincide with or follow Modi’s. She will hold a rally in south Kolkata at the same time Modi is in North Kolkata and will campaign along the same route in North Kolkata the following day to counteract the Modi effect. The seventh phase of the election will decide the fate of 9 seats in Bengal, all of which were won by the TMC in 2019. The BJP is focused on winning these seats, while Mamata Banerjee’s mission is to retain them. The campaign has been charged, with both parties making strong allegations against each other.

        "content": "Netanyahu acknowledges 'tragic mistake' after Rafah strike kills dozens of Palestinians TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that a “tragic mistake” was made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians. Local officials say at least 45 people were killed in Sunday's strike. It only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel’s military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. At least 21 dead in Memorial Day weekend storms that devastated several US states A series of powerful storms in the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend has killed at least 21 people as they left a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coat later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Biden says each generation has to 'earn' freedom, in solemn Memorial Day remarks WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is marking Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation’s fallen toward creating a more perfect union, “for which they lived, and for which they died.” Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden says each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country’s service members is not in vain. Says Biden: “Freedom has never been guaranteed. Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms in Trump hush money trial WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. Perhaps Wednesday, before the jury begins deliberations, the judge is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case. North Korean rocket carrying its 2nd spy satellite explodes in mid-air SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says its attempt to put another spy satellite into orbit has failed. North Korea’s state media say a rocket carrying the spy satellite exploded midair on Monday evening. Monday’s failed launch came hours after leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. The launch drew rebukes from the North’s neighbors because the U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. At least 2,000 feared dead in Papua New Guinea landslide. These are some challenges rescuers face BANGKOK (AP) — The Papua New Guinea government said more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive in a landslide in the South Pacific island nation. The disaster struck after the side of a mountain came down in the early hours of Friday morning when the village of Yambali was asleep. The settlement is located in a restive and remote area in the interior of the poor, rural nation off the northern coast of Australia, making search and rescue efforts complicated and hazardous. Relations between EU and Israel plummet as Spain, Ireland prepare to recognize a Palestinian state BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel are in a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain. Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz has told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. The EU’s foreign policy chief has thrown his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including Hamas leaders. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030. Bill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71 Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance.",

        "content": "Netanyahu acknowledges 'tragic mistake' after Rafah strike kills dozens of Palestinians TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that a “tragic mistake” was made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians. Local officials say at least 45 people were killed in Sunday's strike. It only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel’s military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. At least 21 dead in Memorial Day weekend storms that devastated several US states A series of powerful storms in the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend has killed at least 21 people as they left a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coat later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Biden says each generation has to 'earn' freedom, in solemn Memorial Day remarks WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is marking Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation’s fallen toward creating a more perfect union, “for which they lived, and for which they died.” Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden says each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country’s service members is not in vain. Says Biden: “Freedom has never been guaranteed. Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms in Trump hush money trial WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. Perhaps Wednesday, before the jury begins deliberations, the judge is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case. North Korean rocket carrying its 2nd spy satellite explodes in mid-air SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says its attempt to put another spy satellite into orbit has failed. North Korea’s state media say a rocket carrying the spy satellite exploded midair on Monday evening. Monday’s failed launch came hours after leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. The launch drew rebukes from the North’s neighbors because the U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. At least 2,000 feared dead in Papua New Guinea landslide. These are some challenges rescuers face BANGKOK (AP) — The Papua New Guinea government said more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive in a landslide in the South Pacific island nation. The disaster struck after the side of a mountain came down in the early hours of Friday morning when the village of Yambali was asleep. The settlement is located in a restive and remote area in the interior of the poor, rural nation off the northern coast of Australia, making search and rescue efforts complicated and hazardous. Relations between EU and Israel plummet as Spain, Ireland prepare to recognize a Palestinian state BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel are in a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain. Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz has told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. The EU’s foreign policy chief has thrown his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including Hamas leaders. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030. Bill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71 Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance.",

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas , with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel's military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. An initial investigation found that the soldier had responded to an exchange of fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants, Egypt’s state-owned Qahera TV reported. Egypt has warned that Israel’s incursion in Rafah could threaten the two countries’ decades-old peace treaty . Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from Israel's strongest supporters. The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images\" from the strike on Rafah \"are heartbreaking.\" It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. \"There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he wrote. The Foreign Office of Germany, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel for decades, said “the images of charred bodies, including children, from the airstrike in Rafah are unbearable.” “The exact circumstances must be clarified, and the investigation announced by the Israeli army must now come quickly,′ the ministry added. ”The civilian population must finally be better protected.” Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. The ICC only intervenes when it concludes that the state in question is unable or unwilling to properly prosecute such crimes. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "content": "Two women have filed a lawsuit accusing kicker Brandon McManus of sexually assaulting them on a Jaguars team flight last year. Michael DiRocco of ESPN reports that the Jaguars are by the two flight attendants for failing to supervise McManus, who now plays for the Commanders, and failing to create a safe environment for staff serving the team. They are seeking a jury trial and more than $1 million in damages. The Jaguars declined an opportunity to comment and a statement from McManus or his attorney is expected to come later on Monday. McManus is accused of trying to kiss one woman while she was seated during a turbulent period of the September flight and “grinding up against her” during one of the flight’s meal services. The second woman also accuses McManus of grinding against her and then “smirked and walked away” when confronted about it. The lawsuit also claims that McManus offered money to other flight attendants to “drink and dance inappropriately.” McManus spent nine seasons with the Broncos before joining the Jaguars last year. He signed a one-year contract with the Commanders in March.",

        "content": "Atlante’s ultra-fast charging stations, designed by Bertone Design, equipped with solar panels and energy storage systems, will soon arrive on Italian highways to serve electric mobility Milan, Italy — Atlante, the company of NHOA Group dedicated to electric vehicles fast and ultra-fast charging network, has won the first tender in Italy for the design, construction, and management of over 90 ultra-fast charging points for electric vehicles (EV) for Autostrade per l’Italia (ASPI). The charging points will be located in 8 service areas along the highways managed by ASPI and will feature the exclusive design by the international firm Bertone Design, as well as the presence of solar panels and energy storage systems. This award represents an absolute innovation in Italy, where Atlante is the first independent operator to install its charging stations on the ASPI highway network, continuing the path towards widespread electrification on the entire Italian road infrastructure. Atlante’s charging stations, equipped with ultra-fast charging points up to 400kW, will allow electric vehicles to recharge in a few minutes and will be uniformly distributed throughout the national territory, particularly in service areas in Lombardy, Veneto, Tuscany, Campania, and Apulia. All Atlante stations will be equipped with photovoltaic panels covering the charging station, combined with storage systems for better management of the solar energy produced on-site. This forward-thinking decision allows Atlante to continue providing an optimal charging experience while offering a charging experience powered by 100% renewable energy. Atlante stations will be recognizable thanks to the iconic canopy designed by Bertone Design and will integrate various technological solutions, including: a system for detecting unauthorized parking of internal combustion engine vehicles, intelligent lighting and signage, and Wi-Fi connection. There will also be digital information totems and a 24-hour video surveillance system. “Our mission is to contribute to achieving zero-emission mobility in Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal. This award represents a further step after the 87 fast and ultra-fast charging points on the French highways for VINCI Autoroutes and consolidates Atlante’s position as main independent operator in Southern Europe in the development and management of fast and ultra-fast charging networks on highway infrastructures,” commented Stefano Terranova, CEO of Atlante. “Increasing charging stations on Italian highways is a concrete response to concerns about the compatibility of electric vehicles with long-distance travel. Making charging simple and ultra-fast even on highways simplifies the transition to electric mobility, thus contributing to a more sustainable future. These new ultra-fast stations increase Atlante’s presence in strategic Italian infrastructures, from major airports to ring roads and major highways, allowing Atlante customers to recharge throughout the national territory without further worries,” stated Gabriele Tuccillo, CEO of Atlante Italia. Atlante’s charging stations will be accessible 24/7, even to people with reduced mobility, equipped with POS terminals for payment with bank cards, usable by all electric vehicles, and compatible with every charging standard and electric mobility service provider.

        "content": "Lewis Steele reported [27 May] that Sean Dyche is “exploring” a deal to sign Harrison this summer after featuring regularly when fit in the 2023-24 season. This deal has been made easier as Leeds missed out on promotion to the Premier League at Wembley against Southampton. The Toffees are said to already be exploring getting a deal over the line. Leeds’ 1-0 defeat now means they will look to sell players this summer, which has given the Toffees confidence in signing Harrison. Harrison was a useful asset to Dyche’s squad as Everton secured yet another season of Premier League football with time to spare. The winger has got plenty of experience now in the top division which certainly makes him a positive addition to the side. With himself and Dwight McNeil firing on all cylinders with Dominic Calvert-Lewin through the middle, the Toffees have a solid front line. The 27-year-old will likely come for quite a large fee given the financial situation at Goodison Park, but he could be worth bringing in. In the Premier League last season, he scored three and assisted three but only featured from the start across 25 games [ ]. If he can maintain fitness over the course of the whole campaign, he could prove to be one of Everton’s more important players next season. The positivity behind this move depends on the fee that the Toffees pay to Leeds given the financial struggles they are likely to endure this summer. In other Everton news,",

        "content": "Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa met European Council President Charles Michel on Sunday in Brussels as part of a visit to the heart of EU institutions. Earlier Sunday, Mustafa met with Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide who officially gave him recognition of the State of Palestine papers. Mr Mustafa was in Brussels to meet with international partners including EU Foreign Policy chief Josep Borrell and Norway’s Foreign minister who handed over the official papers for recognition. He says the Palestinian Authority is preparing to be the government of the future state of Palestine – including Gaza. \"The first priority is to support our people in Gaza. They need every support we can. And I think the best support we can all do for them is to speed up the ceasefire. Every day represents a major loss of human lives and properties and hope for our people,” said Mohammad Mustafa, the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority. He also met with Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares and EU High Representative, Josep Borrell. Meanwhile, the Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares says his country won’t be intimidated by Israel’s response to recognition of Palestine after Israel announced it would no longer allow Spanish NGO’s work in the West Bank. \"Our goal is to recognize the State of Palestine tomorrow and make every possible effort to achieve a permanent cease-fire as soon as possible, and ultimately, to reach that definitive peace. That is what is currently focusing our attention, what is important, and what has centered our conversation in the previous meeting and the attack mentioned, I believe that what it does is underline what the International Court of Justice has indicated,\" said José Manuel Albares Bueno, the Spanish Foreign Minister. Norway, Spain and Ireland last week agreed to recognize a Palestinian state in a move welcomed by Palestinians as an affirmation of their decades-long quest. Israel recalled its ambassadors to the three countries in protest. Several European Union countries argue a two-state solution is essential for lasting peace in the region. Additional sources • AP",

        "content": "A Manitoba school division is saying comments made by a parent that were posted on social media are defamatory and untrue in a recently filed lawsuit. Beautiful Plains School Division in Neepawa, Man. said in a statement of claim filed on May 14 with the Court of King’s Bench that a parent of current and former students within the division has been making defamatory comments against the division and a number of teachers at the schools. Beautiful Plains said in the statement of claim that posts were made on Facebook on April 18, and between May 1 and May 13. Several of the posts were listed in the claim which named a number of employees in the division, and used profanity such as “f**king Nazi” “You’re a b***h” and \"toxic piece of s**t.\" The posts also accused staff of sexualizing children, abuse, misogyny and sexism, the suit said. \"The Division says that the Online Defamatory Statement are false and were made for the improper purpose of causing embarrassment and humiliation to the Division and/or its employees,\" the claim reads. The division said in the lawsuit, that the comments were meant to undermine the division and \"lower the Division in the estimation of members of society in general.\" The lawsuit also said the division's character and reputation have been \"severely injured\" and that it will \"continue to suffer significant loss and damage and irreparable harm.\" The division is calling on the parent to stop making and publishing untrue statements and to delete previous posts from their social media, the claim said. The division is also asking for general and punitive damages. CTV News Winnipeg has reached out to the parent but has not heard back. No statement of defence has been filed. The allegations have not been tested in court.",

Corbin, 35, captioned the post, \"Still got it.\" In the video, the actor was shown jump roping double dutch in an NYC neighborhood. Corbin starred in the 2007 Disney Channel Original Movie, Jump In! In it, he played amateur boxer Izzy Daniels, who is asked to sub in as a jump rope team member for a Double Dutch tournament by his friend, and eventual love interest, Mary - played by Keke Palmer , 30. In the TikTok , Corbin sported a gray T-shirt, denim shorts, and aviator sunglasses as he skipped over the rope - performing stylish tricks as he jumped. Fans rushed to the comment section to share excitement about the \"iconic post.\" One person wrote, \"When I tell you this cured EVERYTHING about my childhood. LOVED 'jump in.'\" \"People walking by not knowing how iconic this is,\" commented another. Corbin replied, \"Why I love NY.\" \"What do you mean 17 yrs? It still feels like it only came out a couple of years ago,\" mentioned a shocked fan. The actor responded, \"2007,\" along with a mind-blown emoji. \"Ahh jump in was one of my fave disney originals back in the day!! what a throwback,\" wrote a fourth commenter. \"ICONIC POST,\" asserted another. One fan joked, \"Okay fine, I’ll go watch Jump In again.\" Corbin rose to fame as Chad Danforth, the basketball-playing best friend of Troy Bolton, played by Zac Efron , in High School Musical. After the third film wrapped, he turned his musical talents to Broadway and established himself as a fixture in American theatre. People walking by not knowing how iconic this is.\" He's trodden the boards for In The Heights, God Speed, and Holiday Inn, the New Irving Berlin Musical. Corbin has also established himself on the small screen with roles in The Beautiful Life: TBL and on the silver screen with Scary or Die among other films. He has also released two albums, Another Side (2007) and Speed of Light (2009), but only his first release charted at 36 on the US Billboard chart. In 2011, Corbin was dragged into a court battle over the failure of the racing film Free Style, as reported by the Hollywood Reporter . The lawsuit alleged that the film failed due to a mix of alleging fraud, breach of contract, and misrepresentation. The financiers, who brought the suit, also claimed that Corbin hadn't promoted the film enough. It is not clear how the claim was resolved. In 2013 he appeared on Dancing With The Stars and came second. Corbin tied the knot with long-term girlfriend Sasha Clements on July 23, 2016. Sasha Clements was born on March 14, 1990, in Toronto , Canada but moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting. Her first role came in 2005 as the robber girl in the TV film The Snow Queen before she moved on to the TV series Majority Rules! In 2009. Like her husband, Sasha was a Disney actor as well. Okay fine, I’ll go watch Jump In again.\" In 2014, Sasha appeared in the Disney Channel movie How to Build a Better Boy. The Canadian actress went back to her roots and appeared in both Degrassi: The Next Generation and Degrassi Don't Look Back. Corbin met his now-wife in 2011 in the grocery aisle at a supermarket, later going on a date when he met her as she was finishing her shift. Sasha is a Disney lover who grew up enjoying the Disney theme parks which became the eventual stage for Bleu to propose. In 2014, the couple took a trip to Disney where Bleu popped the question in front of the Cinderella Castle while taking a photo. The couple stood in front of the cameras and they started rolling, Blue said he had a glass slipper prop to put on Clements’ foot. Instead, Sasha looked down to see Corbin on one knee with an engagement ring in the glass slipper. When she said yes, fireworks were timed to go off behind them and Bleu told her they would, in fact, be staying in the Cinderella Castle. Sasha reflected on their meeting and said, “I don’t know if I believe in love at first sight but I definitely believe in ‘something at first sight.’ We both remember feeling that spark of something being different.” They were engaged for two years and were married on July 23, 2016, at the Hummingbird Nest in Santa Susana, California .",

        "content": "DEAR MISS MANNERS: My husband and I have suffered from several years of infertility, and I am often asked why we don’t have children. As it’s none of their business, and for privacy reasons, I typically answer with, “Though it’s a desire, it has not come as easy for us as others.” Whenever someone inquires further, I would like to know how to politely tell them it’s none of their business. GENTLE READER : In polite language, “None of your business” is translated as “That is a personal matter.” DEAR MISS MANNERS: I was wondering if my daughter should have sent thank-you cards to my wife and myself when she graduated from college. My wife said she should have, but I don’t feel the same way. Could you please let me know? GENTLE READER: In the normal course of events, children take it for granted that their parents feed, clothe and educate them. In happy families, it sometimes strikes adult children how enormous an undertaking that is. That may bring on a spontaneous burst of gratitude, beyond the usual affection that children who have felt loved and cared for will presumably have been expressing. This may be prompted by special occasions, such as parental birthdays; typically, however, the full realization of the time, energy, patience and money spent occurs when the children have children of their own. Miss Manners would not have thought that college graduation would bring this on. Does your wife really want to focus on your shared contributions to your daughter’s education, however much you sacrificed, instead of on your daughter’s achievement? Isn’t this the time to tell her how proud of her you are -- not how indebted to you she is? That may come later. Miss Manners hopes it will not be merely with a paltry card. DEAR MISS MANNERS: I am a case manager at a law firm and frequently must call people at another law firm to discuss cases that we have together. Sometimes the receptionist at the other law firm will ask detailed questions as to what the call is about before transferring me to the person with whom I need to speak. I don’t mean a simple inquiry as to which case the call is about -- I mean detailed questions. In my view, it’s none of the receptionist’s business what the call is about; if the law firm wanted her to have substantive conversations about cases, she would have a different position than receptionist. On the possibility that she may be following instructions, I’ve never pushed back, but it does irritate me. Is there a polite way to convey “It’s none of your business, so please put me through to So-and-So” without actually saying that? Or does business etiquette require that I answer whatever questions the receptionist has before speaking with the person I actually called to talk to? GENTLE READER : Well, this is not a personal matter. And most likely, the receptionist is not being nosy, but rather following instructions from her employers, as you suggest. Still, you could say, “She’ll know what it is about.” Miss Manners hopes that works.",

Today, though, most regions should hit highs in the mid-teens. Conditions are also just unstable enough that there is a risk of non-severe thunderstorms later this afternoon into early this evening. In the northeast, a low near Island Lake should continue to bring on again, off again rain to the region today and likely this evening. By contrast, parts of the northwest should catch at least some sunshine. High pressure building into the province over the next day or so will bring more sunshine to the south on Tuesday, particularly by the afternoon around Winnipeg. Wednesday will be a great day to book a tee time or to just head outside with temperatures in the south expected to climb into the mid-20s in the afternoon with lots of sunshine. Showers can’t be ruled out later in the week before a warm, even hot start to meteorological summer on the weekend as we move into the month of June.",

Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

Biden said that last year the Department of Veterans Affairs delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever before. He credited the PACT Act, which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned,\" Biden said. \"Not anymore.” Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans and Gold Star family members.",

        "content": "Manchester United have confirmed yet another high-profile player departure after announcing that Raphael Varane's contract will not be extended. Earlier this month, the Red Devils announced that the from Old Trafford at the end of the season. A compatriot of his, Anthony Martial, will now join Varane in bidding farewell to the club, as confirmed by United today. \"Dear Manchester United fans, It’s with great emotion that I write to you today to say goodbye. After nine incredible years at the club, the time has come for me to turn a new page in my career,\" the striker announced on Instagram. \"Since I arrived in 2015, I have had the immense honour of wearing this shirt and playing in front of you, the best supporters in the world! You have been an unwavering support, through the good times and the difficult. Your passion and loyalty have been a constant source of motivation for me. \"I'd like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you've done for me. Your songs, your encouragement and your love for the club are memories that will remain engraved in my heart forever. \"I would also like to express my gratitude to all my team-mates, technical staff and all the members of the club I have met during my 9 years here. I am proud to have been able to share these experiences with you. \"Manchester United will always be in my heart. This club has left its mark on my career and offered me an incredible opportunity to play in front of you. I'm leaving to take on new challenges, I'll always be a Red Devil and I'll continue to follow the club's results with passion. Thank you again for everything, and see you soon. With all my affection, Anthony Martial.\" The French forward joined the 20-time English champions in 2015 from Monaco, and amassed 317 appearances across all competitions, scoring 90 goals along the way. Injuries in recent seasons have seen Martial's importance at the Red Devils decline dramatically, with the striker having only featured 19 times this term. Upon his arrival at the club, the then-teenager was considered among the most promising players in Europe, but ultimately failed to live up to expectations. Martial, who will become a free agent at the end of June, won four trophies during his nine-year stay at United. You must be to read and post comments",

        "content": "The Senate Committee on Capital Market has cleared Dr. Emomotimi Agama as the Director-General of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Committee chaired by Senator Osita Izunaso, also approved the nomination of Frana Chukwuogor as Executive Commissioner (Legal and Enforcement). Mr Bola Ajomale as Executive Commissioner (Operations) and Mrs. Samiya Usman as Executive Commissioner (Corporate Services). President Bola Tinubu had on April 19 this year appointed Agama as the DG of SEC to take over from Lamido Yuguda. His appointment as SEC DG has been hailed by capital market stakeholders who described him as a technocrat that would boost the birthing of the Tinubu administration’s $1tn economy. Speaking shortly after his confirmation, Agama, a technocrat and insider of the commission said he will accelerate the development of the capital market in a manner that would boost wealth creation, attract investments and create jobs for Nigerians. According to him, his team was appointed by President Tinubu to change the narrative of the capital market and reposition it to the path that would boost economic growth. He said, “We are bringing on board innovation, development. We are going to change the narrative of the Nigerian capital market. We are going to turn it around. That is the essence of our appointed by Mr. President. With this team, we assure Nigerians that we’re going to do the best that the President has the desire to do. “So, we should all wait to see what is going to happen. Our desire is to move this market forward. And to help in achieving the President’s $1tn economy in the shortest possible time. “Yes, the President is going to be a year in office in a few days. That is remarkable because as an anniversary giver, the President has given us to Nigerians to do the best to change the market.” He described the capital market as the barometer of the economy, noting that the Commission would implement innovative polices and programmes that will create world-class companies in such a way that will ensure redistribution of wealth. Agama said, “You must understand that the capital market is actually the barometer of any economy. And without a strong capital market, then, of course, the economy will not do very well. The intention of this management is to make sure that we mainstream the capital market in the Nigerian economy. “And in doing that, we’re going to be able to provide employment, change the narrative, and create companies that are going to be top world-class companies in such a way that there will be what we call redistribution of wealth. “The President has an intention to change the lives of Nigerians. And the capital market is one of the vehicles that the President intends to use to achieve that. That is why the President has set up a team like this to be able to do that.”",

        "description": "Mired in a devastating conflict, Congo is desperate for help. The only groups keen to step in are mercenaries, Russian and otherwise.",
        "content": "GOMA, Congo — In a makeshift nightclub in the hull of the overnight ferry from Goma to Bukavu, a handful of teenage boys are trying out some new moves. Some land, some don’t. When they don’t, the elderly man on the bench next to us nudges us and rolls his eyes, amused. The DJ, who has so far been playing the usual Afrobeats hits and Congolese rumba, whips out a more unexpected Communist crossover: the Russian Internationale — the pre-1944 Soviet national anthem — mixed with a Congolese beat. People immediately pack the dancefloor. Here in eastern Congo, enthusiasm is palpable for the “Russians,” a catch-all term for the roughly 1,000 Eastern European mercenaries stationed in Goma as well as actual Russian mercenaries embedded in other fragile states — and the Russian government, which it approved a tentative military cooperation agreement with Kinshasa. The reason is simple. Since 2022, this area has been mired in one of the world’s most catastrophic conflicts. , the M23 militia has raped and massacred its way through the North Kivu province and is edging nearer to the regional capital Goma — close enough that, the night before, we could hear the rumble of explosions outside the city. The conflict has displaced millions, wrecked lives and livelihoods and destroyed the modest tourist industry. Even the endangered mountain gorillas, the area’s most lucrative draw for visitors, have fled the besieged Virunga National Park to neighboring Rwanda. With international attention taken up by the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, there is little interest in the crisis here and no hope of support from the West. The East African Community sent some soldiers early on, but the alliance quickly . Even the UN peacekeepers are packing up to leave. Congo is desperate for help, and the only groups keen to step in are mercenaries, Russian and otherwise, circling to see what they can gain. Increasingly, too, a complex web of military and commercial actors from Russia, China, UAE, the U.S., France, Bulgaria and Romania — the interests of which on paper should not overlap — appear to be working together to maximize this extraction. Historically, inviting in foreign militaries and especially mercenary groups has gone spectacularly badly throughout Africa. And while Russia may have pulled off an impressive PR feat by convincing Congolese citizens that it will be a genuine ally, its mercenary forces’ actions elsewhere on the continent tell a very different story. “The Wagner Group and other emerging Russia-backed forces and ‘advisers’ exploit the resources and people of African countries for their personal gain. They are a threat to stability and prosperity in countries where they are present,” a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said in an emailed statement. “These forces do not lower terrorism but rather exacerbate the threat by pursuing draconian, violent tactics. This results in dramatic increases of cyclical violence,” the spokesperson added. As Western countries sanctioned Moscow following its 2014 annexation of Crimea, the Kremlin began frantically military cooperation deals with various African nations. This included a May 2019 with Congo’s neighbor, Congo-Brazzaville/Republic of the Congo, that saw Russia send military specialists to the country and help maintain its Soviet-made equipment. The Kremlin it inked a similar agreement with Congo earlier this year. , Russia has also aggressively expanded its military presence across Africa through the Wagner Group, a collection of front companies and Russian mercenary outfits formerly owned by the late businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin. Once a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, Prigozhin launched the Wagner Group following the annexation of Crimea to further the Kremlin’s foreign policy goals even as sanctions piled up and the country became diplomatically isolated. The U.S. designated the Wagner Group as a transnational criminal organization in January 2023, and the Treasury connected individuals and companies. But by May last year, it was believed to have around mercenaries stationed in Africa — many of whom were former Russian soldiers and convicts. Wagner troops have been in Mali, Sudan, Central African Republic, Libya and Mozambique, and its mercenaries have been accused of torture, rape, child abduction and summary execution of civilians. Wagner-linked companies are involved in gold smuggling and illegal mineral exploitation, using Cameroon as a logistics and transport hub. The group also engaged in (through AFRIC, Prigozhin’s fake election monitoring organization) in Congo, Zimbabwe, Madagascar, Mozambique and South Africa. These activities tend to follow the same pattern, journalist Julia Steers said. “Get into a country that has a complex and protracted conflict that has been unsolvable by other countries by selling security personnel, services and training, and then once you are in the country you take advantage of what that country has to offer — by propaganda in the media and civil society there, by getting the political class on your side,” she says. That might be through exploitative businesses, as in the Central African Republic, she said, or straight-up resource extraction, as in Mali. But in any case, the question boils down to: “How can we take advantage of what this country has to offer once we have got our foot in the door through this security agreement?” Steers was formerly VICE News’ Nairobi bureau chief and has spent years investigating and interviewing Wagner employees across the region, gaining rare access to their operations on the ground. Wagner’s Africa strategy, Steers says, is to identify hotspots with vast mineral wealth that are beleaguered by conflict and present themselves as the solution. “In reality, what we’ve seen is that they often just prolong the conflict in a different way,” she said. The trick appears to be doing just enough to contain the worst militias that the population comes to accept abuse and exploitation as a necessary payoff. “When I was first in the Central African Republic, the sentiment was very much, ‘Russia very bad, Wagner very bad, they’re slaughtering us’,” Steers said. “But when the rebels almost took Bangui, it truly was Wagner that prevented it from falling. The perception on the ground — and the reality on the ground — was that they are doing something.” If a country is in dire enough straits, she said, the population starts to see “very, very incremental improvements” as a positive thing — “even at the cost of human rights.” Prigozhin and several Wagner commanders died when an apparent caused his private jet to crash in August 2023, two months after launching a short-lived mutiny that Putin called an act of treason. But the Wagner Group lives on in Africa and is now reportedly directly controlled by the Kremlin under the new name Africa Corps. In February, the BBC that General Andrei Averyanov, head of a Russian military intelligence unit that specializes in “targeting killings and destabilizing foreign governments,” had assumed leadership of Africa Corps and appeared to be striking deals with powerful warlords, coup leaders and military juntas in Libya, Burkina Faso, CAR, Mali and Niger to help consolidate control in return for signing away mineral rights to Russia. The Kremlin last June that the Russian state had no role Wagner/Africa Corp is hardly the first set of state-linked mercenaries to exploit security crises in African nations and gain access to valuable resources. During the 1960s, as the last of the European colonial powers were pushed out of Africa by independence movements, several scrambled for ways to cling to whatever power they could, fearing that newly independent African states would align themselves with the Communist U.S.S.R. Today, the private security contracting business in Congo is booming. The American Erik Prince, formerly of the notorious Blackwater group, was alleged by a UN report to have been MONUSCO peacekeeping services to potentially fill their role with his mercenaries. The most prominent actor currently on the ground however is Horatiu Potra, the Romanian mercenary who openly operates his armed private security firm, Asociatia RALF, in eastern Congo. The armed security operators are officially there as military instructors and to guard key infrastructure like airports. But, from on-the-ground observations, they were also taking part in active combat missions in North Kivu. The risk of foreign fighters operating inside Congo was brought to international attention this month when U.S. citizen Christian Malanga was shot dead while leading in Kinshasha. Another three U.S. citizens were detained by Congolese forces. The motivations and wider support for the group involved in this failed attempt to seize power remain unclear, but the operation stands as a reminder that, even in 2024, foreign actors are still using armed force to gain control in this mineral-rich state. Russia will capitalize on situations like this when it many Western companies, governments, militaries and certainly private security forces operating in Africa of selfishness and exploitation. The problem is that they have made it clear, at every juncture, that they will do the same. “If Africa Corps, formerly Wagner, were to arrive in the DRC, their objectives would be the same as they have been elsewhere — and even more so — which is to strengthen and extend the influence of the Russian state and show the West as feckless and self-interested, although Russia is feckless and extremist, and really acting like a neo-colonial power in Africa,” says Vanda Felbab-Brown, co-director of the Africa Security Initiative at the Brookings Institution in Washington. And while ideologically opposed countries — especially the U.S. and France on one side and Russia and China on the other — disparage each other’s predatory inclinations, behind the scenes, their most vocally patriotic mercenary leaders and mining investors appear more than happy to work together, forging dangerous alliances in spite of, rather than in support of, their respective countries’ interests. Back in Goma, outside a building that locals identify as a “Russian” base, a mercenary with an Eastern European accent smirks when we ask him if he’s Russian or Romanian. “It doesn’t matter where I’m from,” he says. “All that matters is that as long as we’re here, you’re safe.” In a sense, it’s true — no matter where these mercenaries are from, the outcome will be the same. Rebel militias might be held back, at least a little, at least for a time — and in the long term, the country will see even more of its wealth and resources slip away into foreign hands. But here in eastern Congo, where the most pressing priority is keeping the wolf from the door, it’s a risk politicians and the public appear willing to take.",

        "content": "An Egyptian soldier was killed during a clash with Israeli troops at a Gaza border crossing on Monday while an Israeli airstrike on Sunday killed at least 40 Palestinians at a camp for displaced people, further inflaming regional tensions over the Israel-Hamas war. Egypt’s military confirmed that a border guard died at the Rafah border crossing on Monday, in bloodshed that threatened to escalate tensions with Israel. Separately, the airstrike at the camp northwest of the Gazan city of Rafah drew international condemnation. Israel acknowledged the death of dozens of people in the strike, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called “a tragic mistake” in an address to the Knesset. Israeli leaders said they were still investigating both incidents. In the border clash, the Israel Defense Forces said “a shooting incident occurred on the Egyptian border,” and that discussions with Egypt were ongoing, without giving any more detail. Israel said the airstrike late Sunday at a Rafah tent community was based on “precise intelligence” and that it killed two “senior” officials from Hamas, designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and European Union. But governments across the world were quick to condemn Israel for the strike. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was “outraged,” while EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said he was “horrified.” The White House said in a statement that images of innocent civilians killed in the strike were “heartbreaking.” “Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,” the National Security Council said in a statement. “But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians.” Israeli troops started operations around the outskirts of Rafah, which lies in southern Gaza, early this month. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will attack the city because it’s the last bastion of Hamas, an Iran-backed Islamist group, and several thousand of its fighters are lodged there. The U.S. and other countries fear mass casualties among the Palestinian civilians in Rafah and have urged Israel to cancel or sharply curtail an assault to prevent harm to innocents. The White House said Monday it was “actively engaging” with the IDF and partners in the region to better assess what had occured. The U.S. and others have also voiced concerns about an Israeli attack on Rafah worsening ties with Egypt. The two Middle Eastern countries signed a peace deal in 1979, which is seen as crucial to Israel’s security. Egypt has been highly vocal of the war in Gaza and consistently called on Israel to agree to a cease-fire. The Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7 when thousands of Hamas fighters crossed into southern Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and abducting 250. Israel’s counterattack has killed some 35,000 Gazans, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. (With assistance from Justin Sink.) ©2024 Bloomberg L.P. Visit bloomberg.com.

        "content": "AMN / Ahmedabad Gujarat High Court on Monday said it had no faith in the state machinery, which gets into action only when innocent lives are lost. A special bench of Justices Biren Vaishnav and Devan Desai asked the Rajkot Municipal Corporation whether it had turned a blind eye to such a big structure coming up in its vicinity, after the RMC’s lawyer submitted that the TRP gaming zone had not asked for requisite permissions. The court said the state machinery gets into action only after innocent lives are lost. The HC was hearing a suo motu PIL on the deadly fire. Earlier, it had called it a “man-made disaster”. The court also observed on Monday that all the Rajkot municipal commissioners, from the time the TRP gaming zone was set up in 2021 till the time of this incident (on May 25) “should be held accountable for the tragedy that occurred”, and directed them to furnish separate affidavits. On Monday, a counsel pointed out that the incident required immediate preventive and corrective measures, and the state will have to come forward to hold a person accountable, and this calls for drastic steps. The court then said, “Who will take such drastic steps? Honestly speaking, we do not have faith in the state machinery now. Four years after orders of this court, directing them, after their assurance, this is the sixth incident that has happened. They only want lives to be lost and then trigger the machinery,” the court observed. Meanwhile Gujarat government on Monday shunted out five officials, including Rajkot Police Commissioner Raju Bhargava and two other IPS officers, after a massive fire at a game zone facility killed 28 people, including four children. Bhargava has been replaced by IPS officer Brijesh Kumar Jha. Additional Commissioner of Police (Administration, Traffic and Crime) Vidhi Choudhary and DCP-Zone 2 Sudhirkumar J Desai have also been transferred, officials said. According to police, the gaming zone did not have the required fire safety clearance from the city’s municipal corporation at the time of the incident. While the gaming zone owners had submitted bills to the police for fire safety equipment and claimed to have installed such equipment on the premises, the process for obtaining the necessary Fire NOC (No Objection Certificate) was underway, but had not been completed. It is suspected that the fire might have started due to a short circuit, but officials said that the exact cause will be known only after a probe. The action comes a day after Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel visited the site and instructed the officials to take strict action against those responsible for the horrific incident. The police have arrested the gaming zone’s owner – Yuvraj Singh Solanki, and his manager – Nitin Jain, under various charges, including culpable homicide. “An FIR has also been registered against four other accused under sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), and 114 (abettor present when offense is committed) of the Indian Penal Code,” a police official said. The six individuals against whom the case was registered by the Rajkot taluka police in the wee hours of Sunday are Dhaval Corporation proprietor Dhaval Thakkar, Raceway Enterprise partners Ashoksinh Jadeja, Kiritsinh Jadeja, Prakashchand Hiran, Yuvrajsinh Solanki and Rahul Rathod. The state has announced an ex gratia of Rs 4 lakh to the kin of each deceased. The Central Government has also announced an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh to the next of kin of each deceased person. Gujarat Congress has demanded that senior civic and state officials and office-bearers of the ruling BJP be named in the FIR registered in the Rajkot gaming zone fire, stressing that action against junior-level employees is meaningless.",

        "content": "NEW YORK -- While has remained one of the most productive hitters in the majors this season, he continues making progress in his recovery to getting back on the mound after Tommy John surgery. The superstar said he started throwing from 60 feet last week and reached 80 mph. \"Just progressively increasing the distance,\" Ohtani said through an interpreter Monday before the Dodgers' series opener against the was postponed. \"Usually anywhere from 60-70 pitches, in that distance. Just continuing to increase the distance and the pitches, and just seeing where that goes. I'm not quite sure how far I'm going to go out there, but that's the progression.\" Ohtani underwent the elbow surgery last September as a member of the after going 10-5 with a 3.14 ERA and 167 strikeouts in 132 innings across 23 starts. He is limited to only hitting this season and is on pace to post the best offensive year of his major league career. Ohtani, 29, entered Monday leading the majors in batting average (.336) and total bases (131) in 53 games as the Dodgers' designated hitter. He was tops in the National League in slugging percentage (.621), OPS (1.024) and OPS+ (188). Ohtani has recently played through a hamstring contusion he suffered when he was hit by a pickoff throw last week. He has remained in the lineup, but Dodgers manager Dave Roberts told reporters over the weekend that he was advised to not push the hamstring. Ohtani said the injury has affected his running but not his swing. \"It's getting better day by day,\" he said. \"Today is definitely a lot better than yesterday.\"",

        "description": "During a flight, an apparent \"medical scare\" led to paramedics being called to check on and treat boxing legend Mike Tyson.",
        "content": "Mike Tyson was on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles when he suffered what is being deemed a \"medical scare.\" According to confirmation from Tyson's \"Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great.\" \"He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare-up 30 minutes before landing,\" read an email to the Post. \"He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.\" Tyson was aboard the plane when it was delayed by two hours before takeoff. The initial thought was Tyson could have been removed from the plane at that time, but that detail was never confirmed. Later, representatives confirmed the initial delay in taking off had to do with an \"air conditioning issue\" and not with the medical issue Tyson suffered. Around 30 minutes before the flight landed in Los Angeles, an announcement came on the loudspeaker and on screens asking if there was a doctor on board the aircraft. about the medical issue, as a source told the publication, \"Mike had some kind of medical emergency on the plane and paramedics boarded. Before the paramedics arrived the flight issued an announcement asking for a doctor — the message even came on everyone's screens.\" Paramedics apparently boarded the flight and attended to Tyson, leaving passengers on the plane for an additional 25 minutes. There are no further details about what the ulcer flare-up caused for Tyson, but it sounds like he got the right care. This is a scary situation for anyone Tyson's age (57), but even more for a man who's been gearing up to enter the boxing ring again. Tyson is set to face off against boxer and YouTube star Jake Paul on July 20 in Arlington, Texas. The fight will be streamed live on . There have been multiple videos of Tyson training in preparation for his return to the boxing ring. The biggest concern for the legendary boxer is his age. Many believe Tyson could get hurt in the ring against a much younger fighter. At least his publicly available training videos have revealed that Tyson, the undisputed heavyweight champion from 1987-90, still appears to be in top shape. Still, questions remain. The airplane incident might indicate a more serious underlying medical issue that could keep Tyson from boxing. Texas' equivalent of a boxing commission The Department of Licensing and Regulation also states that \"contestants who are age 36 or older, must submit a report of favorable physical testing including, but not limited to, an EEG (electroencephalography), and an EKG (electrocardiogram).\" Monday's incident might prompt the department to look into details of what occurred, and see if it is consistent with any records Tyson has already submitted in preparation for his fight. The good news is Tyson appears to be in good health, and he was taken care of by the paramedics on the plane.

        "description": "Ohtani has slumped while playing with the bruised hamstring -- he is 8 for his past 38 (.211). But he doesn't blame the hamstring for the lack of results.",
        "content": "NEW YORK – Shohei Ohtani missed a game with lower back tightness but has played through a bruised hamstring for more than a week. But he doesn’t blame that for a .211 average (8 for 38) over his past 10 games. “I don’t think so. Obviously, the leg isn’t that great, but I don’t personally think it’s affecting the swing,” he said through his interpreter early Monday afternoon at Citi Field before news that the day’s game had been postponed. The Dodgers and Mets will play a doubleheader on Tuesday. Ohtani said his left hamstring is “getting better day by day.” His back issue caused him to miss the Dodgers’ game May 12 in San Diego but he said it feels “pretty good” now. “I’ve been working out and making sure that’s in a good place,” Ohtani said. Most of that pre-game work is done in areas off limits to the media and he almost never takes batting practice on the field with the team. So Ohtani’s most visible work is the throwing program he started in late March, six months after undergoing his second Tommy John surgery. Every other day, Ohtani throws briefly on the field. At this point, he has increased the number of throws since playing catch for the first time on March 25 but is still throwing from less than 60 feet. “Usually anywhere from 60-70 pitches, in that distance,” Ohtani said. “Just continuing to increase the distance and the pitches, and just seeing where that goes. I’m not quite sure how far I’m going to go out there, but that’s the progression. “Last week, I got to 60 feet and was able to throw 80 mph.” Even with his recent slump, Ohtani leads the majors in batting average (.336) and total bases (131) and the National League in slugging percentage (.621) and OPS (1.024). He also has stolen 13 bases, halfway to matching his career-high for a full season. It’s the best offensive start of his career but Ohtani doesn’t necessarily attribute that to being able to focus on hitting and not devoting any time or energy to also pitching. “It’s hard to say at this point,” he said. “I have to play a full season to see if I could really say that.” Ohtani could progress to throwing to hitters in simulated-game settings as soon as September but the Dodgers have said he will not pitch in games again until 2025. He does miss pitching, Ohtani acknowledged. “I think any starting pitcher can tell you that there’s a little bit of nervousness going into a game you start,” he said Monday. “In a sense, I do miss that kind of atmosphere. But right now I’m really just focusing on progressing every day and really focusing on that.” Visiting New York for the first time since news of the scandal involving his former interpreter and friend Ippei Mizuhara, Ohtani was asked by the local media how he has been able to perform so well on the field while dealing with the upheaval in his personal life. “I think what affected me the most was not being able to sleep well,” he said in a familiar response. “Now that I’ve been able to do that, I also came to realize how I feel off the field mentally shouldn’t affect my abilities and I have every confidence in my own ability to still play without being affected by anything that happens off the field.”",

        "description": "The Yankees rotation without Gerrit Cole is now on the offensive during a dominant stretch that has played a key role in the club’s recent surge.",
        "content": "ANAHEIM, Calif. — So much for just holding down the fort. The Yankees rotation without Gerrit Cole is now on the offensive during a dominant stretch that has played a key role in the club’s recent surge. Yankees starters have gone 14 straight games in which they have thrown at least five innings and allowed two or fewer runs, tying the MLB record since 1893, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Nestor Cortes will get the ball on Tuesday against the Angels and try to make it 15, which would surpass the 2022 Mets, 1968 Pirates and 1907 Phillies. “It’s been nice, each guy’s been building on the last one,” pitching coach Matt Blake said Sunday before Clarke Schmidt took a shutout into the sixth inning in what became a 5-2 loss to the Padres . “I feel like they’ve got a nice rapport going as a group and they’re all committed to helping each other. The conversations are good. It just feels like they’ve gotten into a good rhythm and each one’s building off the last.” The Yankees entered Monday’s off day with the second-lowest starter ERA in the majors at 2.72. The only rotation that had been better at preventing runs was the Phillies (2.69), who were also the only team that had won more games than the Yankees. But the group of Cortes, Luis Gil, Carlos Rodon, Marcus Stroman and Schmidt have taken their starts to another level of late, with 18 of their last 21 starts going for at least five innings and allowing two or fewer runs. “It’s been really all year,” manager Aaron Boone said. “It’s like virtually every day they’ve given us an opportunity to win a game. But what we’ve seen over the last couple weeks and now this turn in the rotation, they’ve been remarkable. Ultimately it starts on the bump and starts with that starting pitcher. They’re the reason — it starts with them — why we’ve been off to this kind of start.” During this 14-game stretch alone, the Yankees rotation has posted a 0.84 ERA with 84 strikeouts and 24 walks across 85 2⁄3 innings. In eight of those outings, the starter has not allowed an earned run. The Yankees are 11-3 during that span. “I think we’re all just a bunch of starters who know we can be elite in this game,” Stroman said. “The flow of information, the pitching coaches and the staff, everything’s so dialed in here. I think we all feel really confident when we go out there each and every start.” Sign up for Inside the Yankees by Greg Joyce, exclusively on Sports+. Please provide a valid email address.

Of course, it doesn’t hurt when the Yankees offense has been rolling the way it has lately, usually giving its pitchers an early lead to work with. “Really, the stretch we’ve been on with those guys [the starters], we’ve just been riding their high,” Alex Verdugo said. “They’re out there dominating, getting us in the dugout to hit that much quicker.” But what makes the run the starters are on even more impressive is that they are doing it without the reigning AL Cy Young winner throwing a pitch — though Cole has played a role in this as an extra pitching coach in the dugout, bullpen sessions and clubhouse. Cole is making good progress in his return from the elbow nerve inflammation that shut him down in March, as he is expected to face hitters again this week (likely on Thursday) before potentially starting a rehab assignment on June 4. That puts him on track to return possibly by the end of June or beginning of July if all goes well. In the meantime, the current five starters have put their heads down, stayed healthy and given the Yankees a chance to win on just about every night. “It’s almost like they all kind of sensed that we’ve got to step up with Cole not there and they’ve all risen to the occasion,” Blake said. “I think they’re just every day putting one step forward and not worrying about when Cole is going to be back and what that even indicates for any of them. Just keep doing their job on a nightly basis throwing up zeroes an inning at a time.”",

The Hollywood star told Esquire magazine: \"I felt that I was respecting her privacy in a way and not wanting to bring up a ton of things that would cause her to have to talk. \"I have so much love and care for her.

Dunne shared an Instagram story showing her soaking up the sun while on a beach vacation. Dunne gave fans a view of her freckled face while tanning in a red bikini on the beach. She tagged the Instagram story from Los Cabos, a beach town in Mexico. The LSU gymnast is taking the time off after a hectic week of travelling around the US. Dunne was in New York and Florida for multiple red-carpet events with Sports Illustrated. The tour was to celebrate the launch of the 2024 Swimsuit edition of the magazine which she modeled in . She showed off in multiple red-carpet pictures alongside models Paige Spiranac , Xandra Pohl , Camille Kostek , and Brooks Nader . Fans shared their admiration for Dunne in her Instagram comments after the red-carpet events. \"Keep it up Livvy,\" one fan said. \"Obsessed you’re so hot,\" another fan said. \"Whoa, that's a whole lot of beautiful captured in one photo,\" a third fan said. \"Y'all both look amazing!\" a fourth fan said. \"She's just perfect I say!!\" a fifth fan said. Dunne took some time off from her modeling duties to go support her boyfriend Paul Skenes in Pittsburgh . \"Back in the Burgh!\" she said in a post before taking in her boyfriend's start. Olivia Dunne and Paul Skenes managed to keep their relationship a secret before finally going public last summer. The pair met at LSU, but it's not clear when they started dating. Rumors of a romance began when Dunne watched LSU win the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska last summer. And Dunne then posted selfies from Fort Myers in Florida, where Skenes was playing. He was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates and began his pro career by playing in minor leagues in the Sunshine State. The final clue came when Dunne posed in a Pirates cap before the pair finally went public. Skenes is blowing people away to start his MLB rookie season in major league baseball. The former LSU fireballer has 21 strikeouts in 16 innings pitched over three games. He has only allowed four earned runs, giving him an ERA of 2.25. In his second start on May 17, Skenes pitched six innings and didn't allow a single run or hit while striking out 11 batters.",

        "content": "A song from more than 40 years ago is making a comeback as part of Subway's £288 million modernisation scheme. On the Underground, written by the late Scottish composer Harry Barry, celebrated the launch of the city’s ultra-modern on TV and radio in 1980. Now the cheery ditty is back centre stage in a social media campaign as Strathclyde Partnership for Transport bids farewell to the old fleet and welcomes 17 new bespoke alongside planned upgrades along the line. The first of the new trains carried passengers in December 2023 with the new trains, currently running alongside the legacy fleet, expected to be fully implemented by the end of 2024. The current fleet is partially automatic but will move to Unattended Train Operations (UTO) only once the new full system is in place. SPT’s Director of Transport Operations, Richard Robinson said: “We are delighted to be able to use Harry Barry’s song celebrating our legacy fleet as we prepare to say goodbye to these much-loved trains from the system. “We’d like to thank Harry’s family for letting us use the track which was commissioned to mark the last modernisation of the Subway. We’re bringing this cheerful song to a brand-new audience.” The musician, of Uddingston, Lanarkshire, died suddenly in 2013, but has a huge back catalogue as a writer and producer in a career spanning 50 years. It’s not the first time one of his compositions has had a resurgence. Harry’s football anthem European Song, which celebrated Aberdeen FC’s victory in the European Cup Winners’ Cup final in 1983, featured in the film Sir Alex Ferguson: Never Give In, which premiered in 2021. Harry’s daughter Kate, said: “We’re delighted that dad’s memory lives on in his music. He wrote hundreds of jingles and songs during his career. His compositions have stood the test of time. “He was a very talented man.” The song is now on Glasgow Subway Instagram and platforms.",

        "content": "You could be flying down the highway in a sparkling, new 2024 Porsche Cayenne while at the same time helping the province’s young skiers fly down the slopes all across the world. BC Alpine, in partnership with Alpine Canada, is holding a fundraising raffle —the deadline is June 15—that has several prizes, the most luxurious of which is the 2024 Porsche Cayenne, valued at more than $126,000. “It’s a beautiful prize,” BC Alpine chief executive officer Anders Hestdalen says. “Either you care about skiing, which is great, or you want to win a Porsche. This is a great opportunity.” The money raised from ticket sales will go toward supporting both grassroots and high-level skiing in the province, which supplies the Olympic team with one-third of its athletes. There are also 32 ski clubs in the province, which means some of the proceeds will fund the organization’s race events, coaches, officials and programs. “B.C. has done really well,” Hestdalen says. “We’ve never had more skiers registered over the past two, three years in the province. So I would say it’s very healthy, but like all sports, prices are increasing and we just want to make sure we can offer programming for athletes when funding is staying the same or going down.” The Porsche, provided by Porsche Centre Vancouver, is Carrera white metallic and features a black leather interior, bringing its value to $126,075. Additional prizes include a commemorative bar of silver weighing 100 troy ounces, valued at approximately $3,052 and sponsored by Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. Also up for grabs are high-quality Rossignol Sender Ti 184CM skis, valued at $1,000, and a BC Ski Team Karbon uniform jacket and pants, valued at $1,050. Tickets are available now, priced at one for $50, three for $135, and five for $200, with a maximum of 17,000 tickets available for sale. The draw will be held on Saturday, June 15, at 4 p.m. at BC Alpine’s headquarters in Vancouver. And when you see a B.C. athlete standing on the podium in Italy in 2026 or taking part in a local ski race at SilverStar or Big White, you can know that you played a role in making it happen. “This supports the best athletes in the country from B.C. who are going to win medals at the Olympics,” Hestdalen says, “all the way down to the club level.” Purchase your tickets here .

Listen to the It's All Kicking Off podcast By Sam Brookes Published: 20:00, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 20:00, 27 May 2024 e-mail 17 View comments Chris Sutton believes Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag was out of line for claiming Mail Sport's football editor Ian Ladyman has 'no knowledge' of football after his side's FA Cup final win against Manchester City on Saturday. United overcame favourites City 2-1 at Wembley , with Ten Hag putting uncertainty over his future behind him to guide his team to a famous win. Following the game, Ten Hag insisted in his press conference that United were exactly where he wanted them to be, but Ladyman pushed back on this after the Red Devils recorded their worst-ever Premier League finish this season. Ladyman suggested the Dutchman should have been able to get more out of his players despite a high number of injuries, but Ten Hag refused to accept this, arguing that Ladyman must have 'no knowledge' of the game if he held this view. Reacting to Ten Hag's terse response, Sutton told Mail Sport's It's All Kicking Off podcast that it was nothing more than a 'cheap shot' from the United manager, and insisted Ladyman had every right to pull him up on his disappointing campaign at Old Trafford.

Listen to the It's All Kicking Off podcast By Lewis Browning Published: 20:00, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 20:02, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments The curtain came down on another Premier League season last weekend, and it was once again one that will last long in the memory. Though most of the league's outcomes were already decided going into the final weekend, the title race went down to the wire as Pep Guardiola and Manchester City made history. The champions became the first side ever to win the Premier League title for a fourth consecutive season, pipping Arsenal to success, largely in thanks to a final day win over West Ham at the Etihad. Throughout the season, the 20 teams and hundreds of players battled it out to earn success for their sides, causing plenty of drama, excitement, and unexpected thrills. Throughout every gameweek, Mail Sport provided a Power Rankings list that judged the best 10 players in the Premier League and, here, we've tallied it up to find out the outright winner.

William Saliba, James Ward-Prowse , Trent Alexander-Arnold (43 points) Read More Arsenal miss out on Premier League title but this is no false dawn... Mikel Arteta's side will be challenging for major honours for years to come, writes SAMI MOKBEL Though no trophy came his or Arsenal's way, it was a season of success for William Saliba, who played every minute of the Premier League campaign for the Gunners on the back of last season's injury woes. The defender has instated himself as one of the best in the league in his position, and was the core of the division's best defence, helping secure 18 league clean sheets and concede just 29 goals. James Ward-Prowse, meanwhile, started well for West Ham, before his form dipped and he found himself battling just to get in the Hammers' team. He picked up just two Power Rankings points after gameweek seven. On the other hand, Trent Alexander-Arnold, meanwhile, started slowly before excelling in a hybrid midfield role. He struggled with injuries and wasn't at his usual best, but incoming manager Arne Slot may help him return to the form that had him regarded as one of the world's best. William Saliba played every game for Arsenal as they took the title race down to the final day James Ward-Prowse (L) had a mixed season in his first year with West Ham, while Trent Alexander-Arnold (R) enjoyed spells in midfield 9. Alexander Isak (61 points) Alexander Isak didn't really break through in Power Rankings until the season run-in, which saw him score 11 Premier League goals in the final 12 matches of the campaign. It wasn't the perfect year for Eddie Howe's men, but Isak was certainly a bright spark and has established himself as one of the best around in his position. The Magpies may face a battle to keep him next season, with the likes of Arsenal said to be circling, but any consideration of an exit would demand a hefty fee due to his form, age and the four years still remaining on his current deal. Due to Manchester United's FA Cup win, Newcastle won't be competing in Europe next season, which may provide the opportunity for Isak to excel even further in league action. Alexander Isak hit the ground running towards the end of the season, scoring goals for fun 8. Declan Rice (74 points) Signing of the season? Maybe. Arsenal won the race to secure Declan Rice's signature last summer when it became clear he would be leaving West Ham, paying a stern £105million for his services. The England star has repaid every penny, though, and almost proved he was the missing piece the Gunners needed to win the Premier League title. Whether he played in defensive midfield or a bit further forward, Rice proved reliable as ever every week (apart from the one time he booted Ben Davies in the north London derby). Like Saliba, Rice played every Premier League game for the Gunners, scoring seven times and notching nine assists. It's possible Arsenal will sign another defensive midfielder in the summer so he can kick on further. Declan Rice has proven a raging success since his £105m move to Arsenal from West Ham 7. Ollie Watkins (76 points) A breakthrough season of sorts for Ollie Watkins has almost definitely earned him a place on the plane for the European Championships with England this summer. He scored 27 goals in all competitions for Aston Villa, playing the role of talisman as his side secured Champions League qualification under Unai Emery, who seems to have unlocked Watkins. Though goals are the name of the game - 19 of them in the Premier League without taking penalties - the 28-year-old picked up the Playmaker award for his 13 league assists. Not bad at all. His reward will be a major international championships and a run in the Champions League. Ollie Watkins had the most successful season of his career, helping Aston Villa back to the Champions League 6. Cole Palmer (86 points) Finishing sixth in Mail Sport's Power Rankings is pretty cold. Leaving your boyhood club for £42.5m, scoring 27 goals in your first season and picking up the Young Player of the Year award is also pretty cold. Now-ex-Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino was forced to deny his side were not 'Cole Palmer FC' during the campaign, but he was by far and away the Blues' best player . He had 42 goal involvements from Chelsea's 77 goals scored and Pochettino truly got the best out of him. Palmer too will be on the plane to the Euros, and his job next season will be to ensure he can replicate the form under a different manager . Beaten to the Golden Boot only by Erling Haaland, it would be a shock if he didn't. Cole Palmer's gamble in leaving Manchester City for Chelsea last year paid off in a major way 5. Phil Foden (88 points) Perhaps the biggest surprise on this list is that Foden is so far down. Winning the Premier League Player of the Year award , he enjoyed the best individual season of his career. Though it reaped just the one trophy in the form of the Premier League, he netted 27 goals as he became City's key and go-to man, finding a home as a wide player drifting centrally. At 23, he already has six Premier League titles to his name and he will likely add many more. Over to you, Gareth Southgate... Phil Foden enjoyed the most successful personal season of his career as he lifted his sixth Premier League title 4. Son Heung-min (90 points) The season was always going to be tough for Tottenham, not only with Harry Kane leaving, meaning there were a fair few goals that needed replacing, but also Hugo Lloris. Two big dressing room voices were no more, by Son Heung-min stepped up as the new club captain to help steer the transition in squad and management. He enjoyed spells both up front and out wide under Ange Postecoglou as the Australian looked to implement a more attacking style of play and, though his form dipped towards the end of the season, his presence was vital. His miss against Manchester City in the penultimate game of the season will live long in the memory of some more than others, but the 31-year-old remains one of the most devastating finishers in the league. The need for adaptation in his game remains, but Son will once again be vital for Spurs next season as they look to go one further and qualify for the Champions League. It was a year of transition for Tottenham, but they were able to rely on Son Heung-min 3. Bukayo Saka (93 points) It was a season of what could have been for Arsenal as a whole, but for Bukayo Saka it was once again business as usual. It is easy to forget he's still only 22. It feels as though he has ben around forever and seems to be the only attacker that is rarely rested or rotated. There were a couple of occasions in the season when that caught up with him - he missed the final game through injury - but it seems Mikel Arteta is leaning how to manage his workload more efficiently. Still Arsenal's key man, still important to England, he will just want to start adding those trophies to his cabinet now. Arsenal didn't win the league, but Bukayo Saka had another successful year for the Gunners 2. Erling Haaland (119 points) Last season's Power Rankings winner can only manage second on this occasion. It was another Golden Boot and Premier League title for Erling Haaland, but he faced criticism in what was a much tougher season than the last. Who could forget his infamous war of words with Roy Keane ? Or his injury-hit spell over Christmas, keeping him out the Club World Cup, that left Fantasy Premier League players reeling? Nonetheless, when he was available, Haaland was more often than not as ruthless as ever, netting 38 goals in 45 appearances. Missing out on top spot by only nine points, he surely would have retained his crown had it not been for injury. Erling Haaland won the Golden Boot and Premier League once again with Manchester City Liverpool's Mohamed Salah takes Mail Sport's Power Rankings crown for the 2023-23 season 1. Mohamed Salah (128 points) The Egyptian King is the Mail Sport Power Rankings king for the 2023-24 season. He didn't feature in the top 10 in the last seven weeks of the season, but his earlier work was enough for Mohamed Salah to cling onto top spot, having spent four weeks at the top throughout the campaign. Post-African Cup of Nations life was tough, as it often has been, but a return of 25 goals and 14 assists in all competitions is no mean feat. Unfortunately he was unable to steer Liverpool to a goodbye Premier League title under Jurgen Klopp, and his future remains unclear , but, for now, he can celebrate another successful personal year in Red.

        "content": "Colombo, May 27 (PTI) Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe will certainly contest the presidential poll to seek re-election and will announce his candidacy in the next two weeks, a senior government minister said on Monday. Harin Fernando, the Tourism minister and a close ally of Wickremesinghe, said. “I can say with certainty that the President will contest.” The island nation’s Elections Commission earlier this month said the presidential election would be conducted between September 17 and October 16. The ruling Sri Lanka People’s Front, commonly known by its Sinhalese name Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), which has the current parliamentary majority, had pressed Wickremesinghe to hold the parliamentary election ahead of the presidential poll. Wickremesinghe, 75, is yet to announce his candidacy despite declarations by two other main opposition leaders: Sajith Premadasa the main opposition leader, and the Marxist JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake. Fernando said Wickremesinghe would announce his candidature within the next two weeks. Wickremesinghe, from the arch-rival party United National Party (UNP), succeeded SLPP-elected president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to become president for the rest of Rajapaksa’s term when the latter was ousted, after the island nation declared first international default, during street protests which lasted between April and July of 2022. Rajapaksa gave in to calls for his resignation due to his inability to handle the unprecedented economic crisis. Some of the SLPP members have turned into Wickremesinghe supporters while the party also saw other members split as well to form other political entities. The Rajapaksa administration announced Sri Lanka’s first-ever sovereign default as forex shortages caused long queues for essentials and fuel. Wickremesinghe since taking over has steered the economy to safety by securing an IMF bailout. Analysts, however, feel that Sri Lanka is not completely out of the woods yet.",

        "content": "Like many others who grew up with pets, we didn’t take our pets to the veterinarian often, and we certainly never took them to get their teeth cleaned. Yet dental disease in pets is hugely common— and can lead to serious problems, not to mention be painful for our beloved buddies. A couple years ago, during a routine checkup for my cat, Mischief, his vet noted he had some tartar on his teeth, and I should consider getting him a dental exam. I put it off, reasoning that he was eating normally and didn’t seem to be uncomfortable. Big mistake. The next time we were at his vet for something unrelated, she told me the tartar buildup had gotten severe. I sheepishly booked his appointment and poor Mischief ended up having two teeth extracted and two “tooth remnants” removed. The remnants were the result of a condition called “tooth resorption” that occurs when a cat’s tooth dentin erodes and is destroyed. According to the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, it affects between 25% and 75% of cats in the United States. It’s also apparently painful. I felt like the worst pet mom ever for having put this off, especially learning that he’d been in pain. Even worse than needing to have teeth extracted, neglecting dental disease can prove extremely dangerous. Inflamed gums can separate from the teeth, allowing bacteria to enter and attack the tooth at the root. At this point, bacteria can also enter the bloodstream and travel to major organs like the heart, liver and kidneys, causing serious complications. The American Veterinary Dental Society reports that 80% of dogs and 70% of cats show signs of dental disease by age 3. Indeed, dogs and cats that find their way to Marin Humane have often had their teeth neglected, so dental issues are common. Many are in constant pain, which can often show itself in behavior issues. To remedy most dental issues, the animal must be put under general anesthesia. They also need bloodwork beforehand to ensure there are no other underlying issues. Veterinarians will examine and X-ray, remove tartar, check for cavities and growths, extract diseased teeth and finally, give those teeth a good polishing, which will discourage the formation of new plaque and tartar. Extraction of problem teeth can provide tremendous relief for suffering animals and most cope very well without the missing ones. But you can take preventive measures against dental disease for your pets right at home. “Start by familiarizing yourself with the warning signs of dental disease like bad breath, yellow-brown crust on the teeth, bleeding gums or pawing at the mouth and commit to a home care regimen,” says Belinda Evans, Marin Humane’s director of shelter medicine. “Also, be sure to visit your veterinarian at least once a year for a checkup.” Just like people, pets need regular brushing along with professional care. Introduce your pets to brushing by putting a small amount of pet toothpaste (not human toothpaste, which can make your pet sick) on your finger and rubbing it on their teeth. Once they become comfortable with this, apply toothpaste on a toothbrush and allow them to lick the bristles, then begin brushing. Ideally, you should brush your pets’ teeth two times a week. Note that it will probably take some time until your pets cooperate. Don’t give up; your pets will thank you!

        "description": "A massive collision involving Kevin Magnussen, Sergio Perez and Nico Hulkenberg brought out the red flags in Monaco...",
        "content": "The fact that a huge shunt involving Kevin Magnussen, Sergio Perez and Nico Hulkenberg in Monaco happened on the first lap is what saved Magnussen from a race ban, claims 13-time race winner David Coulthard. Perez’s Red Bull was destroyed against the barriers after he was tagged by Magnussen’s Haas on the opening lap of the Monaco GP going up the hill out of Sainte Devote, Magnussen’s Haas team-mate Hulkenberg also caught up and eliminated in the incident to make it a triple DNF. Magnussen faced a nervous wait in the aftermath, considering he sits just two penalty points away from incurring a one-race ban, though the stewards determined that no further action was needed. Considering the circumstances, Coulthard says Magnussen should have been backing out of that move, but instead triggered the shunt by keeping his nose stuck in. Analysing the incident on Channel 4, Coulthard said: “I think given that Kevin Magnussen has a number of points on his licence, no harm in sticking your nose in, but at this point you should be backing out, because you can see that’s about as straight as, well not a very strange thing. “And once that contact was made, that is a huge energy crash at the beginning of a grand prix, car heavy with fuel as well. “You can see Perez looks in the mirror, but then at the point at which he looks ahead again, the impact was made. “The stewards have put it down as a racing incident, but that accident was caused because Magnussen stuck his nose in and the chances of outdragging him up the hill and around the outside on a non-straight, slim and none.” 👉 Revealed: The staggering cost of Sergio Perez’s Monaco Grand Prix crash 👉 Alarming footage captures F1 photographers’ lucky escape in Sergio Perez crash Coulthard was therefore asked if he felt that the shunt occurring on Lap 1 influenced the steward verdict of no further action? He was certain in his mind that it did, Coulthard saying that if that incident occurred on any lap other than the first in Monaco, then Magnussen “would be looking at a little holiday from Formula 1”. “Yeah, first lap,” said Coulthard when asked if this is why it was ruled a racing incident? “If that had been on any other lap in the Grand Prix, I think Magnussen would be looking at a little holiday from Formula 1.” Magnussen is battling to secure his future with Haas, the team already in need of one new driver for F1 2025 with Hulkenberg on his way to Sauber.

Aging didn’t scare her; it felt like a triumphant step in her cancer journey. It’s something I have been thinking about recently as my younger brother nears his graduation: how proud she would be of him, and how proud we as a family are of him. With pride on my mind, I want to know, what are you proud of? I’d love to know. Please make it a six-word story, a personal short story, with a beginning, middle and end — not six adjectives, not a cliche and not advice. Make us laugh or cry or at the least feel something. For an example, here is the famous story attributed to, but not proven to be written by, Ernest Hemingway: “For sale: baby shoes, never worn.” That’s quite the story! Need more examples? “It can’t be. I’m a virgin,” writes Kate Atkinson. “Set sail, great storm, all lost,” says John Banville. If you want your story to run in the IJ, please: • Write “Six-word story” in the subject line • Send one six-word story. Just one • Include your full name and Marin town in the body of the email, no attachments • Write your short story in the body of the email, no attachments • Use proper punctuation and spelling • Use sentence style in one line • It should not rhyme • Do not submit six adjectives — that’s not a story Please send to lifestyles@marinij.com by June 14 and look for it in the June 25 lifestyles section and online.

        "content": "Alice Yarish was born Alice D’Alton Foley in Goldfield, Nevada, on April 25, 1909 to Judge Thomas L. Foley and Alice Dean Foley, who was the first woman to practice law in Nevada. After the family moved to Southern California in 1920, her first experience in journalism was working as a correspondent for the South Bay Breeze while she was still in high school. She went on to attend University of Southern California and reported for the Daily Trojan newspaper. She studied law at Southwestern University for two years, but after the death of her parents, the tuition money ran out. While working as a cub reporter for the Los Angeles Express, her big break came as she rode her bike down the Hermosa Beach strand and spotted a black sedan with flags just as Eleanor Roosevelt exited. She approached the first lady and introduced herself. Her story made the front page along with her first byline. During the mid-’30s, she worked as a social worker with the State Emergency Relief Administration. In 1942, she married Peter P. Yarish, who was in the United States Air Force. Yarish was eventually transferred to Hamilton Air Force Base in 1948 and the couple settled in Novato on Yukon Way. For 10 years, which she referred to as “forced domestically,” Alice Yarish focused on raising their four children and being a “military wife.” After the children were in school, Yarish became a reporter for the Independent Journal in 1952 at age 43. She moved on to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat as its bureau chief and landed at the Novato Advance in 1956. After establishing the Marin News Bureau in 1962, Yarish began covering the courts and county government along with working for the Pacific Sun and San Francisco Examiner. In 1972, these positions developed into full-time, and she closed the Marin News Bureau. Prison reform became Yarish’s beat after befriending San Quentin inmate George Jackson. Yarish wrote in a 1976 Pacific Sun column: “It was not until I met the late George Jackson that I learned about the horrors and terrors of prison life. Jackson opened my eyes and filled me with information which I had not known before. I was shocked by what I learned. ... Prisons tend to be breeding grounds of crime, generators of bitterness, destruction of men’s souls.” Yarish used her connection to Jackson to speak with the San Quentin Six during the 16-month trial. Her recognition of humanity towards all involved and her writing style became her trademark as a maverick journalist. In 1972, Yarish wrote a three-part piece on the Marin County Drug Abuse Bureau. She received tips from a judge and a friend of George Jackson’s: discovering that the bureau was planting evidence, stealing drugs and coercing witnesses — all to build up their arrest records. According to her 1993 oral history, Yarish interviewed “dope fiends, drug dealers, probation officers and cops,” along with research into court records. Corruption, entrapment and incompetence were exposed, and the article series prompted the abolition of the bureau. The article series earned a “Best Story in a Bay Area Paper” award from the San Francisco Press Club. Yarish was known for speaking out for those who couldn’t speak for themselves and inspired other people to follow her lead. Yarish died in 2005 at 96 years old, leaving a spectacular legacy behind, which also included wearing distinctive hats, peppering her speech with salty language, cruising around with friends in her red Chevrolet Cavalier convertible and celebrating life with a daily glass of champagne.

        "description": "Māori National Unity Hui moves to Hastings on Friday.",
        "content": "By RNZ Māori from across Aotearoa will gather in Hastings on Friday for the next Hui Taumata. The hui is the next in a series which began at the start of the year when Kiingi Tuheitia called for a National Hui for Unity. The mauri of that hui was then taken to Rātana Pā, Waitangi Day commemorations and continued to the National Iwi Chairs Forum (NICF) a month later. Ngāti Kahungunu chairman Bayden Barber, who is hosting in association with NICF and other tribal authorities, said the hui at Omāhu Marae would seek to identify ways Māori could unify. “One of the key themes spoken of at each of these hui was the need for iwi Māori to unify. We must come together as an irresistible force that cannot be ignored, no matter who is sitting in government.” Māori must not lose momentum, Barber said. “We need to take advantage of the energy and passion that is out there. The timing is right.” In preparation for Friday’s hui, organisers had made documents and power points available on the Hui Taumata website. The documents included discussion papers exploring the idea of a National Iwi Alliance which would function as an entity completely separately from the Crown. Ngāti Toa Rangatira chief executive Helmut Modlik, who facilitated the NCIF wānanga in Rotorua in February, said the time for talking was done. “We’ve done the talking. It’s now time to do the mahi and consider what kotahitanga could look like in the 21st century. If we are to truly achieve rangatiratanga as a people, we need to come together, but it needs form and function.” His discussion paper, titled ‘Towards a Māori Nation’, set out what an initial model for a federation of iwi Māori could look like. Barber said kotahitanga was key to gaining influence. “We have numerous existing collectives within Te Ao Māori such as the National Iwi Chairs Forum, NZ Māori Council, Māori Womens Welfare League etc, and they all play an important role, however, we are yet to achieve the kotahitanga needed to truly influence. “This Government continues to ignore us. We need to change that,” he said. ‘Prove the might of our economy’ Māori activist rōpu Toitū Te Tiriti has issued a national call to action asking Māori to go on strike this Thursday to “prove the might of our economy”. A “Save the Date” post issued on Sunday announced a “National Activation #2′′ would take place on Thursday to coincide with the reading of the Budget. Details released on Monday said the goal was to demonstrate a unified response to the Government’s “assault on Tangata Whenua and Te Tiriti o Waitangi” and included a “day of strike”, a “haka activation” in Gisborne. Thousands of people responded to a national call to action shared by Te Pāti Māori in December last year with “Carkoi” and hīkoi organised in main centres and rural communities. Organisers issued a series of posts asking “all Māori and Tangata Tiriti to GO ON STRIKE for the day to prove the might of our economy by disconnecting entirely from it”. It urged supporters to instead use the day to attend their nearest “rally/hikoi” in their region. The National Urban Māori Authority and Te Kōhao Health would co-ordinate a “Carkoi” on the Southern Motorway in the Waikato Tainui region with further action being taken at key roundabouts in Hamilton later in the afternoon. Toitū Te Tiriti - Tairāwhiti announced a “Haka Activation” event would take place in Gisborne tomorrow evening as part of the lead-up. The post included audio of the haka Te Tiriti o Waitangi composed by the late Dr Ngapo Wehi and an open invitation to anyone wanting to participate in learning and performing it. Tapeta Wehi of Te Wehi Haka would host the event at Tautua Village and organisers said the haka “carries a rich legacy and deep meaning still relevant for our mokopuna of today”.

        "content": "It was fantastic to hear the amazing news that Dundee attractions had won big at the Scottish Hospitality Awards last week. Discovery Point and Camperdown Wildlife Centre won in the Tourist Attraction of the Year and Best Outdoor Venue category respectively, whilst Hotel Indigo Dundee scooped the Best Hotel Award. Discovery Point winning the coveted Tourist Attraction of the Year award was incredible. Working part time at Dundee Heritage Trust, I can see from over a mile off that the staff are dedicated and care passionately about what they do. The past couple of years have been pretty exciting for the incredible team at Discovery Point, with the opening of the Discovery Dome in 2022, then the 30th anniversary celebrations in 2023. The team winning this award in 2024 is just the cherry on the top. And it doesn’t end there. The RRS Discovery is undergoing an exciting conservation project at the moment where they are currently repairing the interior of the ship as more than a century’s worth of wear and tear is needing that care and attention. This is thanks to a £1.4 million funding award given to Dundee Heritage Trust by the National Heritage Memorial Fund. Having previously helped inspire my love for Dundee and working with a dedicated team week in and week out, seeing Discovery Point taking the most sought award was wholesome, they deserve it. The future is exciting for the Discovery! V&A Dundee received a highly commended status in the same category – but what a year they have had, from the incredible Tartan exhibition celebrating five years of the museum, to opening the amazing Kimono exhibition – the first of its kind in Europe. I also recently heard about the incredible milestone that the museum has hit two million visits. I am so delighted for the team there. I worked with them for a period of time, and like , the staff at the V&A Dundee are nothing short of amazing for the work they do. Camperdown Wildlife Centre won Best Outdoor Venue and this wee place, nested in the parklands of Camperdown Park, can at times feel like one of Dundee’s most underrated attractions. Compared to other attractions in the city, it doesn’t get a lot of attention, so to have it recognised is special. Hotel Indigo Dundee has also underwent an exciting renovation, and with the opening of the new Eighteen22 bar, it has come at the right time for the hotel. We are so fortunate to have a wide scope of attractions in Dundee which tailor to each and everyone’s taste, and we shouldn’t leave any behind. It’s clear from these that Dundee’s attractions hold a special place in the hearts of both locals and visitors. This love and dedication are evident, yet it stands in stark contrast to the looming threat of . These sites, much like our award-winning attractions, are integral to the city’s cultural and recreational fabric. As we celebrate the success of Discovery Point, Camperdown Wildlife Centre, and others, we must advocate to keep all our treasured sites open. The potential loss of these beloved institutions for saving £500,000 a year would be a disservice to Dundee’s rich heritage and vibrant community. Let’s ensure that every attraction continues to thrive and inspire future generations.",

        "content": "By: PTI Geneva May 28, 2024 00:30 IST Follow Us Facebook Twitter whatsapp World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday referred to the Global Traditional Medicine Centre set up in India and the first global summit on traditional medicine hosted by the country as he underlined that the year 2023 was a productive one in the UN health agency's work supporting access to medicines and other health products. \"We also established the Global Traditional Medicine Centre in India, and hosted the first global summit on traditional medicine,\" Ghebreyesus said in his remarks as he presented his report to the 77th World Health Assembly in Geneva. In March 2022, the Government of India and the UN health agency had signed an agreement to establish the WHO Global Centre for Traditional Medicine. This global knowledge centre for traditional medicine, supported by an investment of USD 250 million from India, aims to harness the potential of traditional medicine from across the world through modern science and technology to improve the health of people and the planet, the UN health agency had said in a press release at the time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said the agreement between the Ministry of Ayush and WHO to establish the Global Centre for Traditional Medicine (GCTM) - world's first - at Jamnagar, Gujarat, is a commendable initiative. He laid the foundation stone of WHO-GCTM in Jamnagar in April 2022. Speaking on the occasion, Modi had said that the WHO-GCTM is recognition of India's contribution and potential in this field. \"India's traditional medicine system is not limited only to treatment. It is a holistic science of life. India takes this partnership as a huge responsibility for serving the entire humanity.” WHO had convened the Traditional Medicine Global Summit in August last year in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. The summit was co-hosted by India, which held the G20 presidency in 2023. It was held alongside the G20 Health Ministerial meeting. The summit explored the role of traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine in addressing pressing health challenges and driving progress in global health and sustainable development. Ghebreyesus had arrived in Gujarat to attend the global summit on traditional medicine and was accorded a warm welcome. Praising India for its \"rich history\" of traditional medicine like Ayurveda and yoga, Ghebreyesus had stressed the need to integrate this ancient medicinal knowledge into the national health system of countries. \"India has a rich history of traditional medicine through Ayurveda, including yoga, which has been shown to be effective in alleviating pain. The Gujarat Declaration, the main outcome of this summit, will focus on integration of traditional medicines in national health systems, and help unlock the power of traditional medicine through science,\" the WHO chief had said. In his address to the World Health Assembly Monday, Ghebreyesus said 2023 was a year of many challenges, but also of many achievements. He said the year 2023 was a productive one in WHO's work supporting access to medicines and other health products. \"We prequalified 120 medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and other products last year for HIV, malaria, multidrug-resistant TB, Ebola, polio and Covid-19, as well as the first long-acting insulin analogues,” he said. He noted that one of the biggest disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic was to routine immunization programmes in many countries, resulting in backsliding coverage and outbreaks of measles, diphtheria, polio, yellow fever and more. \"In April last year, we launched 'The Big Catch Up' with UNICEF and Gavi, to support countries to shut down outbreaks and restore immunization programmes at least to pre-pandemic levels,” he said. In May last year, the WHO chief had declared an end to both Covid-19 and mpox as global health emergencies. “We continue to call on all countries to maintain and reinforce the capacities for surveillance, detection and response that they built during the pandemic. These investments must not go to waste.” © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd First uploaded on: 28-05-2024 at 00:30 IST Here’s Your Exclusive Pass To Premium Stories CLAIM NOW Deepak Tijori on not asking Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan for help Entertainment May 16, 2024 08:01 IST Deepak Tijori, a veteran actor and filmmaker, spoke about his 30-year journey in the industry and the challenges faced by independent producers.

Following a triumphant major order victory, Helldivers 2 players are enjoying the fruits of their labor in the form of a new mech exosuit. But that doesn’t mean another improvement to the game’s walking war machines wouldn’t be welcome. In fact, some fans have shared their stratagem wishlists on social media, with one of the top requests being a much-needed upgrade to in-game exosuit management. Now, if you’ve been taking a break from the Galactic War, you may not be aware that the latest MO completion . Equipped with dual autocannons and a crushing stomp attack, this new stratagem gives players a much-needed alternative to the oft-criticized Patriot Exosuit. Unfortunately, its addition hasn’t addressed any of the exosuit stratagem’s main issues, like its frustratingly long cooldown and flimsiness at higher difficulties. For this reason, some players have taken it upon themselves to bring these problems to the attention of Arrowhead Game Studios since exosuits continue to be one of the game’s most underwhelming stratagems. One solution that players hope the developers introduce is an exosuit rearm feature. According to , this potential stratagem would replace a depleted mech with a new one, giving players more time to wreak havoc with the hulking bot. Although this wouldn’t entirely fix the exosuit’s durability issues, it would at least make exosuit loadouts more viable since two uses can essentially counteract its 600-second cooldown. Of course, this improvement remains a pipe dream for the player base since Johan Pilestedt, AGS’s new CCO, is focusing most of the team’s attention on . That said, AGS has often valued community output when it comes to improving Helldivers 2, so it wouldn’t be a surprise if an exosuit rearm stratagem is added in the future.

        "content": "IT is a happy family day out for Gavin & Stacey star Mathew Horne as he is pictured in public with his son for the first time since becoming a dad. The actor was spotted with the child and his wife Celina Bassili over the weekend. Mathew , 45, had kept news of his parenthood under wraps and only told his closest friends and family — including his co-stars on the hit BBC1 show. A source said: “Mathew is a brilliant dad and he and Celina love being parents. “Celina’s brother has a son who is a similar age and they loved spending time together. “Mathew also kept the news quiet because he prefers to live his life out of the spotlight, even though he’s a household name thanks to Gavin & Stacey. “All his Gavin & Stacey co-stars know about him being a dad, including James Corden and Joanna Page . “They all have kids so you can imagine the talk on set for the Christmas special is going to centre a lot on their kids.” He and Norweigian set designer Celina are believed to have become parents shortly after they got married in October 2021. The day out in London with his family comes as Mathew prepares to return as Gavin for a final time when the hit show comes back in December for the one-off special. The most reason episode aired in 2019 — nine years after the final full series had screened. Close pal James, and the show’s other writer and co-star Ruth Jones , chose to stick with the BBC for the show, following a bidding war from streaming sites. After his success with the series that debuted in 2007, Mathew retreated from the limelight after other projects fared less well. A sketch show with James, called Horne & Corden, was panned while their comedy film Lesbian Vampire Killers was described as a “witless mess”. He referred to the time as “the negativity” and said in a rare interview in 2010: “The recovery time for something like that was always going to be quite lengthy.” But he says he and James remained close — despite the latter’s success hosting The Late Late Show in the US until last year. He said: “James remains a friend and never wasn’t a friend. “We have remained friends ever since we met. We’ve done various bits of work together and now we’re both off doing other things. “Jealousy isn’t something I do — I am not a jealous person. “I’m thrilled about the success he’s having.”",

        "content": "As we've all been weathering through a seemingly endless news cycle revolving around the evils of the Pine Tree Flag it's nice to be reminded that America isn't the only country that's given to these sorts of wild mania. Over in Germany, who in fairness to them have a history of going to much, much, much more extreme forms of mania than America, the powers that be are also wringing their hands over the possible uses and symbolic meanings of stuff that to the average person would seem silly. In the case of the Germans, it seems that the song 'L'Amour toujours' by Italian DJ/producer Gigi D'Agostino has been cast as a sort of boogieman of the far right... not because of any sins committed by the song itself but because of what bad actors might dare to sing to the tune of the song if it happens to be played. As Disclose.tv reports: NEW - Song \"L'Amour toujours\" by Gigi D'Agostino is banned from the upcoming Oktoberfest in Bavaria because some Germans could sing \"Germany for the Germans, foreigners out\" to it. pic.twitter.com/aY224usqke L'Amour toujours was first released 24 years ago and has maintained lasting popularity in Europe, but we're apparently living in the age where anything touched by anyone who those in power finds distasteful becomes itself tainted like some bizarre form of symbolic leprosy. MORE - The German state security service is investigating several cases in which young people have sung \"Germany for the Germans, foreigners out\" to Gigi D'Agostino's tune at various locations. Seems like an excellent use of police resources, that. It really makes you appreciate the freedoms afforded to Americans by the Constitution... if it were up to these nanny-state types having ever flown a Pine Tree Flag would likely be a jailable offense. The 1st Amendment shows the true genius of the Founding Fathers. When you’re banning songs, you’ve lost. Something tells me they’re going to be singing it anyway. Nooooo, but it was banned! Oktoberfest Festival director Clemens Baumgärtner even said 'There is no room for all the right-wing sh** at the Oktoberfest'! Nobody's going to break the rules, right?! Like finding another tune will be hard for drunk people. thanks for solving racism! That track is an absolute banger and someone needs to be punished for this heresy But people could sing the wrong words to it, don't you understand? It's an existential threat! Liberal democracy is starting to look a lot like East Germany. https://t.co/1oqDWwp5io It's actually a very catchy tune. I was singing it most of the weekend and I am a foreigner https://t.co/MzETeN1l3z Yes, it may be catchy, but you can't have it anymore because it attracts the Wrong Sort, and rather than debate them or convince them that they're in the wrong the organizers of Oktoberfest would just prefer that they all go away or go to jail thank you. What do liberals fear most? A couple of white boys getting together to chug crispy bois while singing along to a BANGER https://t.co/jeDaTsURvj When you have to start banning random innocuous songs in order to preserve the political order, you know you’re in a regime’s last days: https://t.co/uGXzFRI6g7 There's no way it's a good sign, right? The governments of many European countries appear to be continuing to fight a read-guard action against a huge swath of their own populations, populations that seem to have become increasingly restful and unhappy about what the experiment of 'multiculturalism' has been doing to their national identities and local cultures. It's certainly an issue that has been grappled with time and time again in America, but America at least was founded on a 'melting pot' mentality that is more traditionally open to the idea that people of other cultures can be eventually folded into the overall American culture. Europe for the most part has no such legacy, but the legacy they do have is one of things going very very wrong when their governments begin to try to force ideological uniformity on their people, and when the people begin to resent the influence of outside groups within their countries.... and when things go wrong in Germany they have a way of going very wrong indeed. Let's hope the pendulum swing, when it comes, doesn't swing too far in the opposite direction this time.",

        "description": "Both World Series participants are under .500",
        "content": "The Dallas Mavericks are one win away from the NBA Finals, and the Stars are still in the mix for the Stanley Cup. It’s enough to push the Texas Rangers — the reigning World Series champions — onto the back burner in the Metroplex. Not that the Rangers have done much to compete for attention lately. In the middle of all that basketball and hockey hoopla, Texas hosts the Arizona Diamondbacks this week in a rematch of the World Series. Both teams are under .500, costing the matchup some of its luster. For the Rangers, injuries to prominent starting pitchers are just part of the problem. Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer haven’t pitched at all this year, and Nathan Eovaldi and Jon Gray are on the injured list now as well. Despite all that, Texas’ starters have an ERA of 3.65, which is in the top half of baseball. The bullpen, however, has the second-worst ERA in the game at 5.09, with eight blown saves in 17 chances. Offensively, the Rangers were expected to receive a boost from top prospects Evan Carter and Wyatt Langford, but Carter is batting .188. Langford is at .224, and he’s currently on the IL. The good news for Texas is that only Seattle (28-26) is above .500 in the AL West at the moment, and the Mariners lead the Rangers by just three games. The whole division is in negative territory in terms of run differential. Texas manager Bruce Bochy has shown time and time again that all you need to do is make the playoffs to have a shot at winning it all, and the Rangers have plenty of time left to turn their season around — and try to add to this impressive run for Dallas-area sports. TAKING STOCK Last year, 10 of the 12 teams that were in playoff position as of Memorial Day went on to make the postseason. The year before, it was eight out of 12. A fast start that’s lasted this long is generally enough to put a team in very good shape. The postseason odds at FanGraphs already have the Dodgers (98.7, Yankees (98.1 as near-locks to make the playoffs. The Orioles (88.8%) aren’t far behind. Of the teams not currently in playoff position, FanGraphs gives the Astros (53.1%) the best shot to get in. TRIVIA TIME The last two times both defending league champions finished under .500 were in shortened seasons: It happened to the Astros (29-31) and Nationals (26-34) in 2020 and the Blue Jays (55-60) and Phillies (54-61) in 1994. When is the last time it happened in a full season? LINE OF THE WEEK Baltimore’s Kyle Bradish struck out 11 in seven no-hit innings as the Orioles beat the Chicago White Sox 4-1 on Sunday. Bradish left after 103 pitches and Danny Coulombe immediately allowed a home run to Danny Mendick, but that was the only hit of the game for Chicago. COMEBACK OF THE WEEK Pittsburgh trailed by four runs in the bottom of the ninth against San Francisco on Tuesday night before rallying to tie it. Nick Gonzales then hit an RBI single in the 10th to give the Pirates a 7-6 win. The Giants had a win probability of 99.4% in the ninth, according to Baseball Savant. That was the start of a wild week for San Francisco. The Giants overcame deficits of 5-0 and 6-2 to beat the Pirates in their next two games. Then they beat the Mets after being down 6-2 on Friday night and 2-1 in the ninth inning Saturday. New York finally returned the favor Sunday, scoring three runs in the ninth to beat San Francisco 4-3. TRIVIA ANSWER The Royals beat the Cardinals in the 1985 World Series. In 1986, Kansas City went 76-86 and St. Louis was 79-82.",

        "content": "Hello gentle readers, and welcome to the SwitchArcade Round-Up for May 27th, 2024. Holiday? What holiday? Shaun never stops! And that’s a good thing, because neither does the eShop. I’ve got a couple short reviews for you today, looking at and the latest release . After that, we have two new releases to check out. We wrap things up in our usual fashion, with a look at the lists of the latest sales and expiring discounts for the day. Let’s get to it! I found myself teetering on the line of what score to assign this game, and ultimately I’ve decided to lean towards the positive side of that line. I’m doing so because after seriously questioning myself as to what didn’t work for me with , the biggest thing I could come up with is that I’ve played too many games like it before. Not exactly the same, of course. This is the only one where I’ve played as an underworld bouncer, for starters. But broadly speaking this sort of top-down twin-stick attack-and-roll roguelite comes a dime a dozen on the Nintendo Switch, and doesn’t strike any meaningful new ground. With that said, it doesn’t do a whole lot wrong either. I think the attacks could use more oomph. I don’t like bosses with lengthy invincible stages in their patterns, and this game loves them. It takes a little longer than it ideally should to properly get cooking, but that’s getting to be a genre-wide issue of late. Otherwise, it’s fine. It plays well, the presentation is interesting, and once you start unlocking things it opens up really well. You can have a really good time playing this game. has an interesting premise that it doesn’t do as much with as you might like, but it’s a perfectly adequate take on the somewhat well-worn roguelite action genre. My time with it was largely enjoyable, even if I don’t know that I’ll remember much about it in the long run. If you’re looking for a cheeky little roguelite to pass a few days with, this will certainly fit the bill. I really appreciate these releases, but I can’t help but wish that D4Enterprise would localize them. I always have to include a caveat in these reviews, because while I think even someone who can’t read a single kana could probably brute force their way through something like with enough persistence, a lot of people aren’t going to enjoy that. And that’s a shame, because it should be an exciting occasion to have on the Switch. It’s a cult classic that most Western players know from its SEGA Master System release. Some readers of this site may remember when it was available on mobile, too. was developed by Compile, a developer probably best known for creating and its series of shoot-em-ups. It’s an action-adventure game, but it’s an odd one. Some parts are top-down sections where you peacefully talk to villagers. Some parts are side-scrolling action with ratchet scrolling. Sometimes it’s a top-down flip-screen affair in the vein of the original . Sometimes it’s vertical auto-scrolling affair, which is pretty strange. Some of that stuff works better than the rest, but it’s a fun game for its era and this MSX2 version is great. You get the usual extras here, so you can use chapter skips to tour the game even if you can’t understand the in-game Japanese text. This is becoming a pattern with releases, but is a cool game and it’s nice to see this MSX2 version made more accessible to players around the world. Unfortunately, the fact that the game in question hasn’t been localized from its original Japanese form means that a lot of folks who might otherwise enjoy playing the game will find themselves frustrated at not being able to make progress. If you’re feeling adventurous and patient, it’s worth the trip. It’s Orbin’ time! All hail the mighty Orb! This is a party-style twin-stick action game for up to four players via local or online multiplayer. Pick your toy, head out on missions, upgrade your toy, and so on. Chuck your Orbs at the enemies to defeat them. Be careful though, as you do not have infinite Orbs. It seems to be generally well-liked over on Steam, and as long as the port came through okay I’m sure it will find an audience on the Switch as well. This is a rather generic side-scrolling platformer with thirty levels spread across four different worlds. Fancy dining it is not, but four dollars it is. Your call as to whether you want this or four tasty Snickers bars. I suppose you could do both if you’re a high roller. If you’ve been waiting for the entire line of titles to be on sale, here’s your moment. You can also grab the and games at a nice discount if you’re interested in some farming fun.

The study, \"Changes in holopelagic Sargassum spp. biomass composition across an unusual year,\" is published in PNAS.",
        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication trusted source proofread by University of York Researchers have been working to track and study floating sargassum, a prolific seaweed swamping Caribbean and West African shorelines, and causing environmental and economic harm. The study, \" Changes in holopelagic Sargassum spp. biomass composition across an unusual year ,\" is published in PNAS . The stranded seaweed blocks fishing boats; threatens tourism; disrupts turtle nesting sites, reefs and mangroves, and releases toxic gas, which impacts human health and damages electrical equipment. First reported by Christopher Columbus in the 15th century, floating mats of sargassum have long been present in the North Atlantic. However, since 2011, a floating population has established between West Africa and South America, and increased in size to form \"the great Atlantic sargassum belt\"—a 9,000km-long macroalgal bloom, visible from space and estimated to weigh 35 million tons. The massive blooms of sargassum are thought to be down to nutrient pollution and warming seas, and vast quantities of the seaweed end up in landfill each year. The research team, from the Universities of York and Southampton, alongside colleagues from the University of the West Indies in Jamaica and Barbados, set out to learn more about sargassum's biomass composition in order to unlock its potential to be used to produce sustainable products. While the seaweed is an abundant biomass, its possible uses are limited due to its high arsenic content. First author of the study Dr. Carla Machado, a research associate in the Department of Biology, said, \"The small quantities of sargassum that used to wash ashore in the Caribbean provided a habitat for turtles, crabs and fish and contributed to beach formation as it decomposed, but the vast sargassum blooms of the past decade are a global problem that will continue to grow and have a major impact in the affected countries. \"This research project has brought together international researchers specializing in biomass composition and satellite imaging to track, sample and study sargassum, providing crucial new knowledge of this little-understood macroalgae.\" For a biomass to be utilized, it needs to be consistent in its composition; this ensures it can be processed efficiently and behave predictably during production. The results of the study showed that, overall, the biochemical composition of sargassum is consistent throughout the year. The researchers tested different processing methods for the seaweed, including shade-drying or freezing, and found the protein content of the seaweed stayed the same. However, the method of processing did affect levels of other components such as alginate, which can be processed for many applications, including biomaterials. The researchers collected samples of sargassum in Jamaica throughout 2021, which coincided with the April 2021 eruption of La Soufrière on the Caribbean island of Saint Vincent. Using drift patterns, the authors calculated that the sargassum samples they collected in August 2021 would have spent approximately 50 days exposed to ash from the eruption. They found that seaweed that had likely been in contact with volcanic ash contained less arsenic, but had accumulated other elements including nickel and zinc. Lead author of the study, Dr. Thierry Tonon from the Department of Biology at the University of York said, \"Understanding sargassum's response to environmental conditions is crucial for unlocking its biology and potential value. \"With the great sargassum belt also receiving additional nutrients from Sahara dust that blows across the Atlantic, huge quantities of the seaweed washing up on coastlines looks set to become the new normal.\" There is much more work to be done to increase understanding about sargassum and how it is going to behave in years to come, the researchers say. This will provide a body of evidence that could inform an international response to the problems it poses for people and the environment and transform it into something useful. Professor Robert Marsh from the University of Southampton said, \"The sargassum beaching around Jamaica in late summer 2021 carried distinct traces of the volcanic ash that settled upon it around four months earlier, just to the east of St Vincent; this novel 'volcanic tag' confirmed that sargassum arrives each summer at Jamaican beaches after a months-long journey drifting with currents from the central tropical Atlantic.\" Professor Hazel A. Oxenford from the University of the West Indies said, \"Volcanic ash collected in my garden from the St Vincent eruption was used to determine its chemical signature. Being able to detect those components in sargassum after it traveled more than 1,700 km across the Caribbean to Jamaica was exciting. It confirmed our predicted transport pathway for sargassum, showed that the seaweed lives for at least four months and demonstrates the marine connectivity across the region.\" Professor Mona Webber from the University of the West Indies added, \"It is very important for Caribbean Islands being affected by the sargassum inundation to be able to benefit from its valorization. Understanding how the sargassum we collect in Jamaica has changed en route to our shores and factors that could affect especially the arsenic content, will propel us towards safe use of the algal biomass.\" The study was carried out in collaboration between the Universities of York, Southampton and the West Indies.

        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication proofread by SPUN (Society for the Protection of Underground Networks) As our planet warms, many species are shifting to different locations as their historical habitats become inhospitable. Trees are no exception—many species' normal ranges are no longer conducive to their health, but their shift to new areas that could better sustain them has been lagging behind those of other plants and animals. Now, scientists show that the reason for this lag might be found belowground. A study published in PNAS shows that trees, especially those in the far north, may be relocating to soils that don't have the fungal life to support them. Most plants form belowground partnerships with mycorrhizal fungi, microscopic, filamentous fungi that grow in the soil and connect with plant roots to supply plants with critical nutrients in exchange for carbon. Most large coniferous trees in northern latitudes form relationships with a kind of mycorrhizal fungi called ectomycorrhizal fungi . \"As we examined the future for these symbiotic relationships, we found that 35% of partnerships between trees and fungi that interact with the tree roots would be negatively impacted by climate change,\" says lead author Michael Van Nuland, a fungal ecologist at the Society for the Protection of Underground Networks (SPUN). The trees most at risk of this climate mismatch in North America are those in the pine family, find the authors. Areas of particular concern are the edges of species ranges where trees often face the harshest conditions. Here, the authors discovered that trees with higher survival rate in these locations have more diverse mycorrhizal fungi , a sign that these symbioses may be critical for helping trees withstand the effects of climate change. \"Ectomycorrhizal fungi have a different relationship to climate than ectomycorrhizal trees do,\" says co-author Clara Qin, a data scientist at SPUN. \"We are finding evidence that the trees have to answer for these differences.\" The study sheds light on how climate change might be affecting symbioses. \"While we expect climate-driven migrations to be limited by abiotic factors like the availability of space at higher latitudes and elevations, we don't usually account for biotic limitations like the availability of symbiotic partners,\" says Qin. \"It's absolutely vital that we continue to work to understand how climate change is affecting mycorrhizal symbioses,\" says Van Nuland. \"These relationships underpin all life on Earth—it's critical that we understand and protect them.\" More information: Michael E.

        "content": "Anthony Smith isn’t counting out Dustin Poirier ’s chances just yet. Poirier takes his second crack at winning the undisputed lightweight title when he challenges champion Islam Makhachev at UFC 302 in Newark, N.J. “The Diamond” has held an interim title and fought Khabib Nurmagomedov in a unification bout back in September 2019, but Poirier was submitted by Nurmagomedov and is yet to claim the top spot at 155 pounds. Comparisons between Makhachev and Nurmagomedov are inevitable given that they’ve trained together for ages, so Poirier enters the June 1 clash as a significant underdog . Smith, a light heavyweight contender who also works as an analyst, sees a path to victory for Poirier. “A better chance than a lot of people are,” Smith said on The MMA Hour when asked about his confidence in a Poirier win. “I think that he’s got a lot of momentum right now. I think that there’s a lot of comparisons with Islam and Khabib, but they’re very, very different fighters. I think the biggest difference is Islam is willing to stand and strike with Dustin, and that gives Dustin a lot of opportunities to do well. If he can move his feet and force Islam-like, Khabib had a different mindset. He would just wade through whatever you were throwing, if he could get a hold of anything, he was going to start climbing it like a snake. He gets a hold of you and he just starts sinking and pulling you in and it just gets worse. It’s like quicksand, it gets deeper and deeper. “Islam doesn’t really fight like that. Does he have the ability? I don’t know, but his skill set is more diverse, so he’s willing to do more things. I think that opens up a lot of opportunities for Dustin, especially if Dustin can land early and get Islam-he needs him a little bit nervous and have a healthy bit of respect for him coming into range and I think he can be really successful. I think it starts really early, I think you’re going to know right away.” Nurmagomedov famously went 29-0 as a professional fighter before stepping away from competition in October 2020, and Makhachev has carved out a similar path of dominance with just one loss in 26 bouts. He has won 13 straight fights, including a pair of wins over featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski . Though Smith believes that Poirier’s best chance of winning is to out-strike Makhachev, few will be surprised if Poirier goes for one of his now-famous guillotine choke attempts, a submission that is yet to yield him a victory. Smith understands the urge, given that he just logged the first win via guillotine submission in his 57th pro bout, which took place against Vitor Petrino at UFC 301 this past weekend. It was a moment that Smith credits Poirier for inspiring. “The only reason I thought about was when I was in Miami and Dustin kept saying, ‘You miss every guillotine you don’t jump,’” Smith said. “Then I was just like, ‘F*ck, I don’t have any guillotine finishes in my whole career.’ I don’t even know that I’ve ever jumped one in a fight. “A few weeks ago, I was talking about it in practice and I’ve been hitting them ever since then. I just keep finding myself in these guillotines and I’ve said it probably 20 times, wouldn’t it be sweet if I got a guillotine? And here we are. Pretty crazy.”",

Investors and market watchers have long regarded precious metals as the ultimate safe haven, a place to fall back on when the world seems to be going to hell in a handcart. if(window.innerWidthADVERTISEMENTfreestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: \"oilprice_medrec_atf\", slotId: \"oilprice_medrec_atf\" });';document.write(write_html);} This year, jitters around inflation, geopolitical unrest, and a potential US stock market bubble have all helped turn the gold chart into the shape of a hockey stick. An ounce of the coveted soft metal is – at the time of writing – changing hands for £1,910 (/oz), up from around £1,600/oz at the start of the year and £1,484/oz in August 2023. But what exactly is behind this major gold rally – and will it keep going? Gold’s status as a safe haven can be traced back centuries. Used as the world’s first currency in ancient Egypt and – before that – as one of the most sought-after raw ingredients for products like jewellery and sculptures, mankind has ascribed its value for as long as it has existed. Now, the asset is often viewed as useful protection against inflation and uncertainty. Its finite nature stands in stark contrast to cash, which can be devalued by central banks and governments as they decide to print more money. And, unlike its inherently worthless successors—paper cash and, latterly, numbers on a screen—that rely on trust to function, its intrinsic physical value both as a store of wealth and for practical uses further inoculates it from the same collapses of which other asset classes are capable. History also reveals it to be a particularly effective “diversification” asset – by which we mean its price does not have a close relationship to other assets, like equities or debt. This has made it a popular vehicle led by investors, savers and pessimists alike. With the inflation shocks of 2022 and 2023 now behind most major Western economies, some market commentators thought the gold price would start to mellow. Higher rates and a tighter money supply tend to make holding cash and letting it earn interest more appealing than sitting on gold, which doesn’t have a guaranteed yield. In a piece of research at the start of the year, JP Morgan – the bank, not their gold-lauding founder – claimed it was still “bullish” on gold but predicted the metal would peak at $2,300/oz (£1,808) in 2025. if(window.innerWidth ADVERTISEMENTfreestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\", slotId: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\" });`;document.write(write_html);} The timing of this research is noteworthy for two reasons. It was published in January, long enough ago to be at the height of rate cut speculation across Western developed economies when markets were pricing in as many as five rate cuts. Yet it was also recent enough for the inflationary events of October 7 – and the subsequent fighting in Gaza and the Red Sea shipping crisis – to have both taken place continued afoot long enough for them not to be viewed as short-term shocks. JP Morgan factored both of these major drivers into their gold forecast, and still, the gold price had shot past their estimate before the end of April 2024. Why? As ever, there is no catch-all reason to explain the rise. Rather, an accumulation of factors combining to reflect growing uncertainty has pushed up the gold price. Parochially, there are two major Western elections taking place this year. And while two British technocrats having it out this summer is unlikely to send people fleeing to their bomb shelters, the prospect of a second Donald Trump term or, worse still, a contested result that pushes the US Constitution to breaking point yet again will be playing on investors’ minds. All the while, some of the sharpest minds in investment believe that despite this week’s temporary reprieve , inflation is here to stay. The likes of investment house Ruffer and Professor Russell Napier both anticipate rising prices to be an abiding characteristic of the next few years, thanks to de-globalisation and growth in money supply. Gold is no different from any other asset in that its price is as much an indication of expected value as it is of current value – meaning that the current price of gold reflects predictions of a period of sticky inflation. With these geopolitical and economic tensions rarely out of the headlines, it’s easy to ignore another major force pushing up the soft metal’s price: central banks and individuals in the global south – namely Turkey, China, India and Kazakhstan – are buying up gold in record numbers. According to Grant’s Interest Rate Observer, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) bought up 735 tonnes of gold in 2023, while Chinese private sector net imports totalled 1,411 tonnes in 2023 and 228 tonnes this January alone. ADVERTISEMENT This latter camp’s interest in the precious metal has largely been attributed to the major collapse of the country’s housing market, prompting private investors to seek refuge in safer assets. Meanwhile, the Chinese state’s play is – according to economist Philip Pilkington – a sign of a growing trend towards “de-dollarisation”. In recent decades, most countries have decided to store their currency reserves in the dollar due to its consistency and robust track record. But since the US’s seizure of Russian currency reserves in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine, nations like China and the likes of Kazakhstan have sold some of those dollar reserves to negate the damage wrought on their economies by a similar fallout with US.

        "content": "LEO WOODALL has already dazzled us with his TV acting skills, personality and good looks — but now he is working on getting the full Hollywood physique. I can reveal the actor, who found fame on dramas including The White Lotus and One Day, put a mini-gym on the rider of his current film, Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy. It is so he can always look buff when playing London gardener Rockstar, who becomes the toyboy crush of Bridget, played by Renee Zellweger. A TV insider said: “Leo is already in great shape. “But given the fact he’s supposed to be someone who spends all day doing manual work, he really wants to look the part. “So, as the consummate acting pro that he is, Leo is said to be hitting the weights between takes so he can look his best for the cameras. And judging by some of the images that have been coming from the set of the film, the hard work certainly seems to be paying off.” Leo already had viewers hot under the collar when he stripped off in the second series of The White Lotus in 2022. He played Jack, an Essex boy who was hiding an uncomfortable secret underneath his cocky exterior. Then he had audiences in tears playing the leading man Dexter in One Day , an adaptation of the romantic novel by David Nicholls. It was screened on Netflix earlier this year, and once again saw Leo lose his clothes in love scenes. But the actor admitted he had to stop working out so much because he figured the character would not be into beefing up. He said: “I remember thinking that Dex can’t be a big gym guy.” But the need for more muscle was obvious when he took on the role of Rockstar, a Hampstead Heath park attendant in Mad About The Boy. Not only have the movie’s producers put him in an extremely tight T-shirt, Leo also has to have Bridget attracted by his charms, or maybe just his arms. MALALA YOUSAFZAI may be an education activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner, but she likes a laugh. She was invited to feature in the second series of Channel 4 music comedy We Are Lady Parts, about a rock band. Writer Nida Manzoor said: “I had this idea for the song, Malala Made Me Do It, it’s a hype track. I was massively stressed out about how we were going to make sure Malala had a good time. “She was so laid back and easy- going. She also has a very dark sense of humour, and she’s so funny.” IS Love Island taking inspiration from fellow dating show My Mum, Your Dad? After Davina McCall's series proved daters with more life experience can create TV gold, ITV has upped its age limit for the Love Island villa. The full cast, revealed in The Sun yesterday , are the show’s oldest bunch of sexy singles yet. They include a hairdresser, mental health nurse and a sweet salesman. But they also include footballer Ronnie Vint, 27, and recruiter Munveer Jabbal, 30, who says he is mates with Piers Morgan's son Spencer. Then there’s office worker Patsy Field, 29, and make-up artist Samantha Kenny, 26, also alongside the usual clutch of those in their early twenties. It means the average age of the Islanders in this year’s line-up is 25 – more than two years older than in any other season. A source said: “Two years might not sound like a lot but in Love Island years it really is. “Having the older castmates in the mix will hopefully bring about better conversations, meatier storylines and a lot more drama.” Which is handy, because host Maya Jama has revealed her main goal for this year’s series is more war than peace. Ahead of the launch next Monday at 9pm on ITV1, ITV2 and ITVX, she said: “I’ll be honest, I’m hoping for drama. “I want loads of love and happy couples at the end but I do want to be entertained, so I’m hoping for lots of fiery moments.” I CAN reveal comedy drama This Is Going To Hurt has reached the end of its life, with no plans for a second series. The Bafta -winning BBC One show was based on real-life experiences of former NHS doctor Adam Kay and starred Ben Whishaw. Director Lucy Forbes said: “There’s zero chance of it coming back it’s categorically gone. “This Is Going To Hurt was a very popular series and it could have continued, but we told a self-contained story in a single series that was rounded off at the end of the seventh and final episode.” It is at odds with what creator Adam had shared last year, when he hinted: “If I thought of ideas for one I might do it. It remains a possibility.” JOSEPH Fiennes was more scared of having no props or a script than dangers Canada’s wilderness threw at him. He was joined by his cousin – – Sir Ranulph Fiennes – for National Geographic’s Fiennes: Return to the Wild. They retrace the steps of the explorer’s 1971 tour of British Columbia. But death-defying glaciers and mountain peaks were the least of his worries. Joseph said: “I much prefer props and moustaches, and you know, a script to hide behind. “There’s something kind of scary about being exposed and having to be yourself. It’s devised to a degree but it’s unscripted. I’d rather hide behind another persona than to be myself because I’m a little bit awkward.” The second episode is on Sunday.",

        "description": "In Facebook posts this week, a contractor for the District 177 project said he and fellow contractors are not being paid by NGC Group and Rev Development.",
        "content": "As a North Platte mall redevelopment nears completion of the first phase of construction, contractors are filing liens against the Lincoln-based developer and general contractor assigned to the project. Eric Wiezorek, owner of Kingdom Customs Flooring and Construction, posted Facebook messages Thursday saying he and fellow contractors had not been paid for work at the $75 million-plus project. NGC Group, the general contractor hired by Rev Development LLC to oversee the project, said in a Facebook response Friday that the company would fulfill contracts when inspections were completed and the tenant accepted the contracted work. NGC Group and Rev Development are both based in Lincoln. Wiezorek made his frustrations known publicly two days after the North Platte City Council advanced on first reading a proposal to increase Rev’s “enhanced employment area” tax maximum amount by $3.3 million over its maximum 20-year life. However, Wiezorek and another local contractor confronted Rev co-owner Justin Hernandez about the unpaid bills outside the council chamber before the May 21 meeting ended. Rev officials said during the meeting that the additional $3.3 million in EEA funds would help finance a second multi-use building in an undeveloped space on the south side of the property. In his Facebook posts and in telephone conversations with the North Platte Telegraph, Wiezorek said NGC Group owes almost $2 million to roughly 11 contractors, including $83,000 owed for work Wiezorek’s company did on Five Below and T.J. Maxx. According to Wiezorek, he was supposed to be receiving progress payments on the 10th of each month. “I started to notice a problem when they weren’t paying my progress payments,” he said. Wiezorek said that when he asked NGC Group why the payments had not been made, he was told the developer was waiting for T.J. Maxx to pay them. “That wasn’t the agreement,” Wiezorek said “The agreement was not to wait until T.J. Maxx pays us. The agreement is I work for you, you’re in contract with me, you pay me for work rendered.” In its Friday response, the District 177 developers said the work done by Kingdom Customs, Wiezorek’s company, “has not yet passed inspection relating to the project specifications.” “The need for extra attention and supplementation toward that work is directly impacting the tenant’s acceptance of the space and, in turn, results in a corresponding delay in the release of payment for the work completed,” the post said. “NGC will continue to work with contractors through the remaining items that are necessary to obtain approvals and close out these projects, similar to the process we have successfully employed to reach resolution on previous projects in the district.” However, Wiezorek said it was not only his business that hasn’t received payment. Other businesses that have filed liens include Aupperle Plumbing & Heating Inc., K & S Electric Inc. and Troyer Enterprises Inc., according to weekly roundups of construction liens in The New Weekly Record, an online North Platte publication. Wiezorek told The Telegraph he hired a lawyer Thursday to begin the process of also filing a lien. “They’re using the money off of hardworking contractors to build their little enterprise, and they’re pulling it off as how amazing they are and how much they love our community,” Wiezorek said. Because of the two-month delay in payment from the project, Wiezorek said, he had to pay his employees out of pocket in addition to paying for the work done at both T.J. Maxx and Five Below. “It’s crippling because it took every bit of my savings and all of my capital just to keep my doors open,” he said. “That’s how devastating this was. There were a couple weeks that we didn’t get a paycheck.” As a North Platte native, Wiezorek said, this was a devastating experience. “I love this community, and I thought one of the greatest honors I’ve ever been able to be a part of is to be able to rebuild the very center of our community,” he said. “To me, it was more than just getting paid. It was pouring into the future of this community.” City Councilman Brad Garrick, who has supported the transformation efforts for the former Platte River Mall, said he is working to find a solution for everybody. “Obviously, the contractors need to get paid,” he said. “But we also don’t want to slow down things happening, because there are amazing things happening out at the mall. So we’re just trying to mediate and find that happy middle ground that’s going to work for everybody and keep things moving.” Telegraph reporter Todd von Kampen contributed to this story.

        "content": "Minister of Digital Affairs Huang Yen-nun speaks to reporters at a meeting of the legislature’s Transportation Committee in Taipei yesterday.Photo: Lo Pei-de, Taipei Times CHECK AND REPORT: People can submit messages they believe to be scams, and the system would use artificial intelligence to analyze the content, the digital minister said By Shelley Shan / Staff reporter The Ministry of Digital Affairs aims to establish within three months a platform for people to report suspected fraudulent information found online, Minister of Digital Affairs Huang Yen-nun (黃彥男) said yesterday, as lawmakers questioned the ministry’s response to fraudulent advertisements. In his first presentation to the legislature’s Transportation Committee since being sworn in last week, Huang laid out his three policy goals of fighting fraud, bolstering national digital resilience and developing the digital economy. Huang made a series of ambitious pledges, from training 1,000 cybersecurity specialists within two years to generating NT$1 trillion (US$31.07 billion) in output value from the digital economy. However, legislators on the committee focused mostly on the government’s progress in curbing online fraud, particularly that which involved fake products or ads using the names or likenesses of celebrities without their consent. Citing National Police Agency data, Taiwan People’s Party Legislator Lin Kuo-cheng (林國成) said that the number of fraud cases has risen from about 23,000 in 2019 to about 38,000 last year, while the amount of money lost through fraud during that period soared from NT$4.29 billion to NT$8.944 billion. Lin asked Huang if he can offer better solutions to deter fraud. Meanwhile, Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Lin Chun-hsien (林俊憲) said that even though the Criminal Police Bureau had issued 107 administrative rulings asking online platform operators to remove more than 100,000 investment fraud advertisements, the same ads later reappeared. “This shows that operators are only passively tackling fraudulent ads on their platforms. They forgot that they have a responsibility toward society apart from selling ads for money,” Lin Chun-hsien said. Currently, only advertisers of political content are required to register with their real names, but that rule does not apply to those posting commercial ads. “The ministry needs to ask platform operators to regulate themselves. You need to toughen up on this matter, or they would not be afraid of you. You have nothing to fear because justice is on your side,” Lin Chun-hsien said. Huang said he hoped lawmakers would quickly pass a draft act on fraud prevention and control during this legislative session, which would provide the legal basis for the ministry to require companies such as Facebook, Google and Line to have legal representatives in Taiwan and comply with the government’s anti-fraud regulations. Platform operators who fail to comply could face a fine of up to NT$25 million or the suspension of their business if it is a serious offense, the draft act says. Meanwhile, the ministry would within three months build a platform for people to report suspected fraudulent text messages or e-mails, he said. “We would then use artificial intelligence to analyze the content. If the content is deemed to be suspicious, we would relay them to other government agencies, depending on the content of the messages,” he said. The Taiwan Network Information Center can also help block fraudulent Web sites, he added. “People can continue to use the 165 anti-fraud hotlines to report fraud if they have been scammed or if the information they received has been confirmed to be a scam. If they are not sure whether a message they receive is fraudulent, they can post it on the platform we are creating to check it,” Huang said. “If the message turns out to be fraudulent, we will forward it to the police. People would not need to report it to the police again.” Since amendments to the Electronic Signature Act (電子簽證法) have been passed, online platform operators can only display ads if they have secured electronic signatures from the advertisers, which would help prevent people from being deceived by ads fraudulently using the likenesses of celebrities. Deputy Minister of Digital Affairs Lin Yi-jing (林宜敬) said that in a meeting with platform operators last week, they told him that they need to follow laws stipulated by the countries in which their parent companies are based and need about a year to update their systems. “I also told them that they need to follow laws in Taiwan if they are doing business here,” he said. 新聞來源: TAIPEI TIMES 不用抽 不用搶 現在用APP看新聞 保證天天中獎 點我下載APP 按我看活動辦法",

        "content": "Cranes, containers and an Evergreen cargo truck are pictured at the Port of Kaohsiung on May 8. The government’s business climate monitor last month returned to a “yellow-red” signal after a two-year hiatus, indicating steady growth, the National Development Council said yesterday.Photo: CNA By Chen Cheng-hui / Staff reporter The government’s business climate monitor last month was “yellow-red” for the first time in two years, as strong industrial production, increasing imports of machinery equipment, robust domestic commercial activities and stock investments boosted the momentum of local businesses, the National Development Council said yesterday. Prior to last month, the business climate monitor had maintained a “green” signal for three consecutive months. The council measures the nation’s economic situation using a five-color system, with “blue” signaling a recession, “green” suggesting steady growth and “red” indicating a boom. “Yellow-red” reflects a slight boom, while “yellow-blue” shows sluggishness. The total score of the monitor’s composite index rose four points from the previous month to 35, indicating steady growth for six months in a row, the council said in a report. Meanwhile, the index of leading indicators, which gauges the economy’s direction in the next six months, moved up by 0.5 percent month-on-month to 102.09, rising for the seventh consecutive month, it said. The index of coincident indicators, which tracks the current pace of economic activity, climbed 0.93 percent to 102.82, increasing for the 13th consecutive month, the council said. “Benefiting from the growing demand for artificial intelligence and other tech applications, indicators such as industrial production, machinery and electrical equipment imports have turned to flashing red. Coupled with continued advancement in the leading and coincident indicators, the domestic economy is steadily recovering,” the council said. Of the composite index’s nine components, the subindices on imports of capital equipment and sales of trade and food services increased by two points each and changed from “green” the previous month to “red,” the report said. The subindex on industrial production rose by one point, going from “yellow-red” a month earlier to “red,” while the subindex on manufacturing sales increased by one point, changing from “green” to “yellow-red, it said. However, customs-cleared exports decreased by two points and flashed “green,” compared with “red” a month prior, the report said. There were no changes in the signals of the other four subindices, including money supply, the TAIEX, non-agricultural employment and sentiment of the manufacturing sector, the report said. Looking ahead, the council expects exports to continue showing steady growth, on the recovery of global trade and growing opportunities linked to emerging applications related to artificial intelligence. It also said it expects domestic investment to continue gathering steam thanks to demand for advanced technologies, digital transformation and net zero carbon emissions, in addition to government projects for public works. Meanwhile, private consumption is expected to retain strong momentum on the back of stable employment, higher minimum wages, a vibrant stock market and more government subsidies for housing and education, it said. “However, uncertainties such as potential interest rate cuts in major economies, continued geopolitical risks and the intensifying rivalry between the US and China still exist, and their future developments deserve close observation,” the council said. 新聞來源: TAIPEI TIMES 不用抽 不用搶 現在用APP看新聞 保證天天中獎 點我下載APP 按我看活動辦法",

After receiving a report of the fire at 10:55pm on Sunday, firefighters at the scene found that cables in a pipe room were burning and emitting thick smoke, the bureau said. Using two water pipes, they brought the blaze under control at about 11:35pm, although residual smoldering continued, it said. Firefighters Lee Yung-chen (李詠真) and Chou Li-hsin (周立鑫) had entered one of the buildings where the power had gone out to rescue the people trapped inside, the bureau said. The pair were taking the stairs to the third and eighth floors, where people were reportedly trapped, when they discovered they had insufficient oxygen, a firefighter said. More firefighters were dispatched to rescue them after receiving distress signals, and found Lee and Chou collapsed on the third-floor stairwell, the firefighter said. The thick and sticky smoke from the burning cables might have made it harder for them to escape, they said. Due to the heavy smoke more than 100 people remained trapped in the complex yesterday morning, while firefighters worked to vent the smoke. The complex consists of four 28-floor buildings. One resident said her family waited on their balcony until about 7am yesterday before being rescued by a ladder truck. The last of the 351 residents were evacuated from the complex in the early afternoon. Some children inhaled smoke and needed to be hospitalized, the bureau said, but no other deaths were reported. The cause of the fire and the deaths of the firefighters had yet to be determined as of yesterday. Hsinchu Mayor Kao Hung-an (高虹安) early yesterday morning visited rescued residents and family members of the deceased firefighters at a hospital, offering her condolences and gratitude. She said the city government would handle the affairs for Lee’s and Chou’s families. Lee, 39, had served in the fire bureau for 19 years and Chou, 34, for 14 years, the bureau said. 新聞來源: TAIPEI TIMES 不用抽 不用搶 現在用APP看新聞 保證天天中獎 點我下載APP 按我看活動辦法",

        "content": "VALDOSTA — Sports Turf Company, a specialty sports construction and surfacing company, has announced announce it has been awarded Bazemore-Hyder Stadium’s artificial turf renovation for Valdosta High School. The Wildcats’ field renovation is the third project that Valdosta City Schools has awarded to Sports Turf Company. In late 2022, Sports Turf Company renovated the Wildcats’ existing natural grass practice field to artificial turf. Sports Turf returned in 2023 and into 2024 to complete the artificial turf baseball and softball facilities. “We are honored to continue our work at Valdosta High School providing state-of- the-art surfaces for their student-athletes,” Sports Turf Company President Todd Wiggins said. “The Wildcats’ staff is committed to giving its athletes the best facilities, and we’re grateful to continue providing surfaces that provide unparalleled safety, performance, and durability.” The new surface at Bazemore-Hyder will feature AstroTurf’s RootZone 3D Blend HD, Brock shock pad and organic BrockFILL. AstroTurf’s RootZone 3D Blend is a performance system that combines slit film and monofilament fibers with a RootZone layer of texturized fibers for optimum durability and better shock absorbency. The Brock shock pad and BrockFILL are specifically engineered to optimize safety for athletes during impacts to the surface. BrockFILL is the latest in organic infills and is sustainably grown and harvested in Georgia. Sports Turf specializes in the construction and installation of sport surfaces, including natural grass and artificial turf fields, tennis courts, and track surfaces.",

        "description": "Meric Gertler, appeared before a House of Commons committee, along with other school administrators, to talk about antisemitism on campuses and what measures they are taking to deal with it.",
        "content": "Shortly after a was held at the encampment at the University of Toronto, the school’s president and chancellor, Meric Gertler, appeared before a House of Commons committee, along with other school administrators, about antisemitism on campuses and what measures they are taking to deal with it. At the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, Gertler made a statement and then took questions from MPs, on the weeks long encampment at the school. “Our efforts to combat antisemitism are comprehensive and multi-faceted. Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, the answer for us and for society at large must be no,” said Gertler. “Ultimately, we believe that the most effective way to respond to this challenge is to focus on our core mission of education and research.” Appearing alongside the presidents of University of British Columbia, McGill and Concordia, Gertler and his compatriots all agreed that antisemitism is currently a serious problem on campus. Thornhill MP Melissa Lantsman asked specifically about the U of T encampment, inquiring whether the hundreds of protesters are holding the rest of the 97,000 students hostage to their beliefs. “We have been meeting with student representatives in our discussions about how to end the encampment peacefully,” said Gertler. “We have a very clearly articulated policy for considering divestment proposals which we have used in the past. And we are saying to the protest group, the policy is there. It lays out the steps and you’re free to use it. And we hope that they will because that is the only way that we can actually address this.” Lantsman held up an image of a pro-Palestinian symbol that was reportedly taken from the encampment, and asked why this antisemitic symbol was visible on the campus. “We have asked the student organizers of the encampment to remove signage and language which is offensive. And they have complied on occasion. Not in every instance,” said Gertler. “In other instances, we have reported hateful acts and hateful speech to Toronto Police Services.” Gertler said there had been approximately 38 incidents which may qualify as hate speech or hateful acts that are being investigated. Lantsman pressed him on whether any U of T students have been suspended or expelled for their role in protests and the encampment. “The encampment has been in place for three and a half weeks. And so, we have not yet (but) those processes are underway,” said Gertler.",

        "content": "Taiwanese barber Chiu Yen-chung, left, cuts the hair of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves at the Grand Hotel Taipei on Tuesday last week.Photo: CNA / Staff writer, with CNA Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves is known as a strong supporter of Taiwan on the international stage. The longest continuously serving head of government since his country became independent in 1979, Gonsalves has visited Taiwan 12 times since becoming prime minister in 2001. His most recent visit was last week to attend the inauguration of President William Lai (賴清德) on Monday. During his dozen trips to Taiwan, he has met four different presidents — Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁), Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九), Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) and now Lai, who he called “my brother William.” However, none of them have had a more enduring friendship with the Vincentian prime minister over that time than an individual who Gonsalves has met on almost every one of his trips to Taiwan and continues to call his good friend: his Taiwanese barber Chiu Yen-chung (邱炎鐘). Chiu, 82, has been working for decades as a barber at the Grand Hotel Taipei, a iconic history-laden hotel where foreign dignitaries often stayed during the second half of the 20th century. Chiu has served two late presidents, Chiang Ching-kuo (蔣經國) and Lee Teng-hui (李登輝). Gonsalves said that when he first visited Taiwan in 2001, he needed a haircut, and as he was staying at the Grand Hotel, he was introduced to Chiu. “He told me about the stories, about his history [in cutting the hair of former presidents], and we became friends,” Gonsalves said. Since then, he has visited Chiu on almost every one of his trips to Taiwan, even if he was not staying at the Grand Hotel. Gonsalves said that he had his hair cut before visiting Taiwan to attend Lai’s inauguration, but he still booked a slot with Chiu on Tuesday last week to see his old friend. Chiu said he cut many other world leaders’ hair decades ago at the Grand Hotel, when Taiwan had more diplomatic allies, but Gonsalves is the only foreign political leader he has regularly served in recent years. “He is very easy-going even though he’s the prime minister,” Chiu said, adding that most other senior politicians are more serious-looking. The two have maintained an relaxed relationship often punctuated with laughs over the past 12 years, even though Chiu cannot speak fluent English. The two have communicated through an interpreter assigned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs over the years, but Gonsalves said Chiu’s “English has improved,” a compliment that Chiu did not buy. Chiu said the ministry pays Gonsalves’ barber fee but the prime minister always gives him a “very generous tip” himself, although Chiu would not say how much. Asked about his role as an unofficial diplomat for Taiwan and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Chiu said he was simply doing his job as a barber and offering the best service he can. Now in his 80s, Chiu said he would continue to do his job “as long as his health permits.” 新聞來源: TAIPEI TIMES 不用抽 不用搶 現在用APP看新聞 保證天天中獎 點我下載APP 按我看活動辦法",

        "content": "LEO WOODALL has already dazzled us with his TV acting skills, personality and good looks — but now he is working on getting the full Hollywood physique. I can reveal the actor, who found fame on dramas including The White Lotus and One Day, put a mini-gym on the rider of his current film, Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy. It is so he can always look buff when playing London gardener Rockstar, who becomes the toyboy crush of Bridget, played by Renee Zellweger. A TV insider said: “Leo is already in great shape. “But given the fact he’s supposed to be someone who spends all day doing manual work, he really wants to look the part. “So, as the consummate acting pro that he is, Leo is said to be hitting the weights between takes so he can look his best for the cameras. And judging by some of the images that have been coming from the set of the film, the hard work certainly seems to be paying off.” Leo already had viewers hot under the collar when he stripped off in the second series of The White Lotus in 2022. He played Jack, an Essex boy who was hiding an uncomfortable secret underneath his cocky exterior. Then he had audiences in tears playing the leading man Dexter in One Day , an adaptation of the romantic novel by David Nicholls. It was screened on Netflix earlier this year, and once again saw Leo lose his clothes in love scenes. But the actor admitted he had to stop working out so much because he figured the character would not be into beefing up. He said: “I remember thinking that Dex can’t be a big gym guy.” But the need for more muscle was obvious when he took on the role of Rockstar, a Hampstead Heath park attendant in Mad About The Boy. Not only have the movie’s producers put him in an extremely tight T-shirt, Leo also has to have Bridget attracted by his charms, or maybe just his arms. MALALA YOUSAFZAI may be an education activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner, but she likes a laugh. She was invited to feature in the second series of Channel 4 music comedy We Are Lady Parts, about a rock band. Writer Nida Manzoor said: “I had this idea for the song, Malala Made Me Do It, it’s a hype track. I was massively stressed out about how we were going to make sure Malala had a good time. “She was so laid back and easy- going. She also has a very dark sense of humour, and she’s so funny.” IS Love Island taking inspiration from fellow dating show My Mum, Your Dad? After Davina McCall's series proved daters with more life experience can create TV gold, ITV has upped its age limit for the Love Island villa. The full cast, revealed in The Sun yesterday , are the show’s oldest bunch of sexy singles yet. They include a hairdresser, mental health nurse and a sweet salesman. But they also include footballer Ronnie Vint, 27, and recruiter Munveer Jabbal, 30, who says he is mates with Piers Morgan's son Spencer. Then there’s office worker Patsy Field, 29, and make-up artist Samantha Kenny, 26, also alongside the usual clutch of those in their early twenties. It means the average age of the Islanders in this year’s line-up is 25 – more than two years older than in any other season. A source said: “Two years might not sound like a lot but in Love Island years it really is. “Having the older castmates in the mix will hopefully bring about better conversations, meatier storylines and a lot more drama.” Which is handy, because host Maya Jama has revealed her main goal for this year’s series is more war than peace. Ahead of the launch next Monday at 9pm on ITV1, ITV2 and ITVX, she said: “I’ll be honest, I’m hoping for drama. “I want loads of love and happy couples at the end but I do want to be entertained, so I’m hoping for lots of fiery moments.” I CAN reveal comedy drama This Is Going To Hurt has reached the end of its life, with no plans for a second series. The Bafta-winning BBC One show was based on real-life experiences of former NHS doctor Adam Kay and starred Ben Whishaw. Director Lucy Forbes said: “There’s zero chance of it coming back it’s categorically gone. “This Is Going To Hurt was a very popular series and it could have continued, but we told a self-contained story in a single series that was rounded off at the end of the seventh and final episode.” It is at odds with what creator Adam had shared last year, when he hinted: “If I thought of ideas for one I might do it. It remains a possibility.” JOSEPH Fiennes was more scared of having no props or a script than dangers Canada’s wilderness threw at him. He was joined by his cousin – – Sir Ranulph Fiennes – for National Geographic’s Fiennes: Return to the Wild. They retrace the steps of the explorer’s 1971 tour of British Columbia. But death-defying glaciers and mountain peaks were the least of his worries. Joseph said: “I much prefer props and moustaches, and you know, a script to hide behind. “There’s something kind of scary about being exposed and having to be yourself. It’s devised to a degree but it’s unscripted. I’d rather hide behind another persona than to be myself because I’m a little bit awkward.” The second episode is on Sunday.",

        "content": "Representatives from a coalition of civic groups in Kaohsiung yesterday hold a banner calling for legislative reform bills to be sent back to committee for deliberation.Photo: CNA By Hsieh Chun-lin and Kayleigh Madjar / Staff reporter, with staff writer Dozens of legal experts yesterday released a statement calling on lawmakers to return five controversial legislative reform bills to committee for deliberation, and to consult more broadly with experts and the public to establish a consensus before passing the bills. The Legislative Yuan is today scheduled to vote on a set of reform bills proposed by opposition lawmakers. All but one have already been voted through to the third and final reading, which might be held today. The bills seek to expand the legislature’s powers of investigation, including imposing fines on government officials, civil organizations and private individuals for failing to cooperate at hearings. Another provision would impose a prison sentence of up to a year on public officials for lying during legislative hearings. Procedural flaws and the unconstitutional content of the bills have led to heated conflict in the legislature and mass protests nationwide, the letter’s 39 signatories said. “As legal experts, we call on the legislature to halt the second reading of the five reform bills and return them to committee for thorough review,” they said. The Constitution does not explicitly grant the Legislative Yuan investigative powers, which are instead governed by four constitutional interpretations: Nos. 325, 585, 633 and 729, they said. No. 585 states that the legislature “may exercise a certain power of investigation,” but “under the principles of separation of powers and checks and balances, the scope of the targets or matters subject to the Legislative Yuan’s investigative power does not grow unchecked.” The bills not only involve the balance of power between the legislature and executive, but also restrict the rights of the general public, the statement says. The interpretation addresses this. “The constitutional principles of proportionality, clarity and definitiveness of law, as well as due process of law, must all be complied with where such procedures may involve any restrictions imposed upon the rights of the people,” it says. The bills’ proposed methods of forcing people to cooperate with investigations infringe on their personal liberties, the experts said. They also lack sufficiently clear explanations of the scope, purpose, means, procedural guarantees, remedies and other necessary details, they said, adding that this would lead to numerous problems. There is also a difference between the legislature’s powers of interpellation and investigation, they said. The former is intended to provide lawmakers information on which to base votes or statements, while the latter is for the legislature to obtain facts necessary to carry out its constitutional responsibility of passing laws and budgets, the experts said. Whether they merit the same level of punishment for disrupting should be carefully considered, they added. The experts called on lawmakers not to rush to a vote this week so that opinions from all sectors can be considered to craft a more complete set of bills. However, if they are passed, the experts asked the Cabinet and president to return the bills to the legislature for reconsideration. 新聞來源: TAIPEI TIMES 不用抽 不用搶 現在用APP看新聞 保證天天中獎 點我下載APP 按我看活動辦法",

        "content": "Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, third left, holds a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, third right, in Seoul on Sunday.Photo: Kyodo News via AP TRILATERAL MEETING: The Japanese Prime Minister said that Japan would continue unofficial exchanges with Taiwan, as per the China Joint Communique of 1972 By Liu Tzu-hsuan / Staff reporter Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida reiterated the importance of stability across the Taiwan Strait while Chinese Premier Li Qiang (李強) said Taiwan issues are “a red line” for China. Kishida and Li traveled to Seoul for the first China-Japan-South Korea trilateral summit since 2019, which was held yesterday. Before the three leaders met, Kishida, Li and South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol held bilateral meetings on Sunday. During the meeting with Li, Kishida “reiterated that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is extremely important to the international community, including Japan,” the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. Japan is closely monitoring developments across the Taiwan Strait, including “the recent military situation,” it said. Kishida was referring to the “Joint Sword-2024A” military exercise Beijing launched around Taiwan on Thursday and Friday last week, Sankei Shimbun cited a source traveling together with the prime minister as saying. Kishida also expressed “serious concerns” about China’s increased military activities around Japan, including the Senkaku Islands, called the Diaoyutai Islands (釣魚台) in Taiwan and China, and the East China Sea, while asking for the immediate removal of buoys that China set up within Japan’s exclusive economic zone, the ministry said. Li said that issues regarding Taiwan and history are “matters of principle related to China’s core interests and also matters of faith,” Kyodo News reported on Sunday. “In particular, the Taiwan issue is the core of China’s core interests and is a red line,” Li said, which Kyodo News said was an attempt to “keep Japan in check.” Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) and Kishida reached an important agreement to promote a “mutually beneficial relationship based on common strategic interests” when they met in San Francisco in November last year. “It is hoped that Japan would keep its promise and create a positive atmosphere for the continuous development of bilateral relations,” China News Service cited Li as saying. Kishida said that Japan’s position regarding Taiwan as stated in the Japan-China Joint Communique of 1972 has not changed, it reported. The document states that Japan would sever diplomatic relations with Taiwan, with which it would deepen non-governmental practical cooperation mainly in the economic field, Kyodo News said. After the trilateral meeting yesterday, the three leaders said they agreed to strengthen cooperation with ASEAN countries and countries in the Middle East as a response to international issues such as the threats posed by North Korea and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The issue about the Taiwan Strait was not mentioned in the joint statement issued after the meeting. Additional reporting by CNA 新聞來源: TAIPEI TIMES 不用抽 不用搶 現在用APP看新聞 保證天天中獎 點我下載APP 按我看活動辦法",

        "description": "Commissioned by the Moray Climate Action Fund, talks in Dufftown and Forres will look at improving local food systems.",
        "content": "ANYONE interested or involved in agriculture and food production is invited to sustainable food systems workshops across Moray this week. Commissioned by the Moray Climate Action Fund, the ‘Moray Good Food Good People’ series organised by PhD Researcher at the University of Strathclyde, Lin Batten and Just Transition research fellow at UHI Moray, Kerry McInnes, and aim to refocus conversations about the 'Just Transition' framework of the Scottish Government towards a local and sustainable food system. Lin explained: “A transition in the food system is necessary. The workshops will offer space to share knowledge, concerns, and connections within the agri-food community. They will give a clear, community-led and bottom-up approach to a Just Transition in the food system. We will discuss what this means for Moray's agrarian and rural communities and how that is to be accomplished. “We will try to find out how we can create a more localised food supply and what type of funding, infrastructure or collaboration is necessary to support it.” Lin believes a sustainable food system in Moray would include producing food in an environmentally-friendly manner, with fair-pay and meaningful labour. She added: “It would also contribute to community-wealth building by keeping the supply chain from farm to fork within the region. “However, I do not know what type of ‘sustainable food system’ might come out of the workshops – this is just my vision and keen to find out the visions of the other participants.” The workshops will entail a brief introduction to Kerry and Lin’s research, the project, and the Scottish Government's Just Transition framework. Following that, a Scottish-based film on the local food system will be screened. After discussing the film, attendees in groups will be asked to draw up what should be included in a local, environmentally-friendly food system, which actors are key, and how this is achievable. Participants will be able to network in the hope that they will collaborate in the future. “Part of the organisation and workshop will also be Maria de Lima,” added Lin, “a ‘Talbot Rice Resident’ based in Glasgow who uses visual mapping as a tool to generate meaningful conversations in the community. “Following the workshops, we will make a film with local company Connecting Images run by Diana Mosterd about Moray's Good Food System. “We plan to interview local farmers embarking on agrarian transition, showcasing best practice and sharing experiences.” The organisers point out that buying local produce in local shops supports local farms. However, the system has to change to make prices as affordable as in major supermarket chains. Lin said: “As long as local and environmentally-friendly food is driving up consumer prices compared to cheaper imported food, local food will always remain the alternative luxury, rather than the norm and a necessity. “That does not equate to farm profitability, as they still have to cope with high land prices, high rents, increased input costs. They struggle to remain economically viable by cutting costs and increasing yields. “There needs to be a systemic and dramatic shift in the way in which our food system operates, our subsidy and funding system is arranged, and how decisions are made from a policy and governmental level in order to achieve a real 'Just' transition in the food system where no one is left behind.” Moray Good Food Good People is on from 7.30-9.30pm in Mortlach Memorial Hall in Dufftown on May 28 and from 7.30-9.30pm in Forres Town Hall on May 30.

        "description": "Nebraska's Daniel Kaelin hasn’t shied away from embracing the competition with his fellow quarterbacks every day in practice and spring camp. “It’s only going to elevate my play.”",
        "content": "While five-star freshman Dylan Raiola has taken much of the spotlight in Nebraka’s quarterback battle, Daniel Kaelin focuses on approaching every day like he’s already the starter. The freshman quarterback wrapped up his first spring camp with the Huskers and has already noted growth in his game through the coaching staff and the quarterback competition. He hasn’t shied away from embracing the competition with fellow quarterbacks every day in practice and spring camp. “That only pushed myself and all the guys to improve,” Kaelin said. “It’s only going to elevate my play.” Kaelin noted how new quarterback coach Glenn Thomas has helped him work to attack every play. He added that defensive coordinator Tony White’s ability to disguise things in the defense has helped him learn to read coverages and different schemes better. The knowledge passed down from the coaching staff, from coach Matt Rhule to the assistants, has made the biggest impression on Kaelin after his first spring camp. “Sometimes they don’t even try to and it’s just stuff that they know that’s just helping myself learn more about the game of football,” Kaelin said. As a freshman, Kaelin has many goals, but a short-term objective is reaching 218 to 220 pounds by the start of fall camp. Looking forward to this season, he aims to get on the field and make as much of an impact as he can in whatever action he gets. Kaelin was a three-star recruit who played at Bellevue West before he arrived at Nebraska. On Saturday, he returned to the school to help quarterback coach John Teigland with a quarterback development camp for players in fifth through 12th grades. He worked with fellow college quarterbacks Zane Flores, who is at Oklahoma State, and Nate Glantz, who is at Lindenwood. Kaelin and Flores have known each other for six years. The biggest aspect of their relationship is how they’ve pushed each other. They’ve grown close over the years through working together and their battles in high school. Kaelin noted how he’s looked up to Flores and wanted to follow in his footsteps as a successful high school quarterback. Their relationship also goes beyond the football field. Their competitive nature extends into other sports like golf, where Flores and Kaelin both said Flores was the better of the pair. Kaelin did make it clear that he was the only one to get a birdie when they played golf Friday. Teigland, who hosted the camp, started working with Kaelin when he was in seventh grade. Teigland noted the growth he’s seen in Kaelin, and earning a spot with the Huskers was no mistake. “The guy is a professional,” Tiegland said of Kaelin. “He lives and breathes this stuff.” Nebraska's Luke Longval looks to the sideline as he calls a play in the fourth quarter during the Red-White Spring Game, Saturday, April 27, 2024, at Memorial Stadium.

        "content": "Minister of Health and Welfare Chiu Tai-yuan speaks at an international news conference in Geneva, Switzerland, on Sunday.Photo: screen grab from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’s Facebook page By Lee I-chia / Staff reporter Minister of Health and Welfare Chiu Tai-yuan (邱泰源) yesterday again called for the international community’s support as he urged the WHO to let Taiwan participate as an observer in the World Health Assembly (WHA). The annual meeting of the WHA, the decisionmaking body of the WHO, began in Geneva, Switzerland, yesterday and ends on Saturday. As Taiwan has not been invited to attend the WHA as an observer for the eighth year in a row, a delegation of health officials and experts led by Chiu arrived in Geneva on Friday to speak up for Taiwan and take part in bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the WHA. Joined by four legislators from across party lines, Chiu held an international news conference at the Geneva Press Club to speak about “How Taiwan’s participation in the WHO can contribute to a comprehensive global health network.” “We are calling for the international community’s support and urging the WHO to act in line with this year’s WHA theme — ‘All for Health, Health for All’ — by including Taiwan in the proceedings of the WHA as an observer, and allowing Taiwan’s regular participation in WHO meetings, activities and mechanisms,” Chiu said in his opening remarks. Taiwan supports actions that can save lives — promoting health and well-being, advancing primary healthcare, ensuring universal health coverage and meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals, but the WHO continues to exclude Taiwan for political reasons, he said. “I would like to reaffirm that neither UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 nor WHA Resolution 25.1 mentioned Taiwan or provide legal authorization for the People’s Republic of China [PRC] to represent Taiwan in the UN system,” he said. “Precluding Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the WHO based on these resolutions cannot be justified,” Chiu said. “Neither the Republic of China [Taiwan] nor the PRC is subordinate to the other,” he said, adding that that is “the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and an internationally recognized objective fact.” “China has no right to interfere with or restrict Taiwan’s participation,” he said, stressing that only the democratically elected government of Taiwan can represent its 23 million people in the WHO and other international forums. “We sincerely appreciate the support extended by diplomatic allies and like-minded countries for Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the WHO,” he added. Taiwan, being a force for good, has the capability and willingness to contribute to global health and well-being, and the whole world would benefit from its inclusion to the WHO and WHA, Chiu said. Asked what name Taiwan would use to join the WHO, Chiu said. “Taiwan is Taiwan, and our country name is the Republic of China (ROC), so using ‘Taiwan’ or ‘ROC’ for joining the WHO or the WHA is what we will insist.” Asked if Taiwan would find alternative ways to join the WHO or the WHA, aside from winning support from diplomatic allies and like-minded countries, Chiu said that, in the past few decades, Taiwan has educated and trained many outstanding healthcare professionals, and they have not only elevated the quality of domestic healthcare, but also participated in many international organizations. Many Taiwanese healthcare professionals also play important roles in international organizations, such as the Taiwan Medical Association, which helped draft the World Medical Association’s statement on health emergency responses, he said, adding that Taiwan has more than 100 professional healthcare groups and their efforts would be the foundation of Taiwan’s successful WHO and WHA bid. Many Taiwanese healthcare professionals are getting further education or training in other countries and building friendships with local professionals, who might eventually also hold key positions in world organizations, so the government would continue to provide more resources to professional healthcare associations to encourage international participation, he said. 新聞來源: TAIPEI TIMES WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus attends the World Health Assembly at the UN in Geneva, Switzerland, yesterday.Photo: Reuters 不用抽 不用搶 現在用APP看新聞 保證天天中獎 點我下載APP 按我看活動辦法",

        "description": "This Indigenous Partnerships Success Showcase discussion happens on June 6, 2024",
        "content": "An economy simply cannot be assessed – or survive – on the weight of dollars and cents alone. Given the fluidity of both economic and environmental conditions, it’s imperative that Canada moves away from its long-standing reliance on fossil fuels to bolster the economic opportunities of the 21st century. And an upcoming panel discussion in Vancouver will examine how to do just that. Held as part of the upcoming 2024 Indigenous Partnerships Success Showcase (IPSS) on June 6, this discussion, entitled Indigenous Opportunities Across B.C.’s Electrification Value Chain, will center around the necessity of electrification due to increasing household and industrial demand, policy objectives, and the imperatives of reconciliation. The panel will be sponsored by KPMG, joining event patron sponsor GCT Global Container Terminals. The panelists include: Josie Osborne, minister of energy, mines and low carbon innovation; Kwatuuma Cole Sayers, executive director of Clean Energy BC; and Michelle Mungall, senior advisor with Energy Storage Canada and Woodfibre LNG, and former provincial minister of energy, mines and petroleum resources. “Having both the present and past ministers of energy, along with the participation of Kwatuuma Cole Sayers, I think is really important because we need to greatly increase the amount of electrification that powers society – we can’t continue to just have fossil fuels powering our society,” says IPSS founder Stewart Muir. To lead off the discussion, Sayers will emphasize the significance of energy transition opportunities for Indigenous communities, stressing economic reconciliation; Osborne, meanwhile, will outline government steps to ensure Indigenous participation in energy transition and asset ownership. Regarding ease of involvement, Sayers will present feedback from Indigenous communities and businesses, and address capacity challenges. The discussion will shift to energy storage, emphasizing its importance in grid reliability and resiliency. Osborne and Sayers will explore how BC Hydro can diversify energy storage in partnership with Indigenous communities. Mungall will highlight the gradual nature of the energy transition and economic reconciliation processes, stressing the need for stability amidst political changes. The panel will conclude with audience questions and closing remarks focusing on collaboration, government policy, and long-term planning for societal shifts. “All of these future growth opportunities are going to require First Nations to be leading, not just a part of or just consulted, but to be really leading in developing those resources,” Muir says. “We can’t have an electrified, clean, future economy without First Nations being at the front of it.” Running June 5 and 6 at the Vancouver Convention Centre, IPSS has become the West Coast's premier conference on partnerships between Indigenous peoples, the business community, and Canadians in general. IPSS stands out from competitors because it is not primarily a B-to-B conference, but what organizers call a \"business to Canadians\" conference. The key theme for this year’s IPSS is on Reconciliation in Action, and responding to the growing demand for practical guidance on how First Nations, Métis and Inuit communities and their enterprise partners can work together, in common purpose, for shared success. “I think these values are shared by many in the community, especially by those who want to contribute toward reconciliation in all spheres of business or cultural life but may not feel equipped,” Muir says. “IPSS will provide guidance, inspiration and networking opportunities to fuel practical steps toward reconciliation.” Tickets for this year’s IPSS are available at www.indigenoussuccess.ca .",

I can reveal the actor, who found fame on dramas including The White Lotus and One Day, put a mini-gym on the rider of his current film, Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy. 6 Leo Woodall is going above and beyond for his Hollywood body Credit: Getty 6 The actor has even put a mini-gym on the rider of his current film, Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy Credit: Getty It is so he can always look buff when playing London gardener Rockstar, who becomes the toyboy crush of Bridget, played by Renee Zellweger. A TV insider said: “Leo is already in great shape. “But given the fact he’s supposed to be someone who spends all day doing manual work, he really wants to look the part. “So, as the consummate acting pro that he is, Leo is said to be hitting the weights between takes so he can look his best for the cameras. And judging by some of the images that have been coming from the set of the film, the hard work certainly seems to be paying off.” Leo already had viewers hot under the collar when he stripped off in the second series of The White Lotus in 2022. He played Jack, an Essex boy who was hiding an uncomfortable secret underneath his cocky exterior. Then he had audiences in tears playing the leading man Dexter in One Day , an adaptation of the romantic novel by David Nicholls. It was screened on Netflix earlier this year, and once again saw Leo lose his clothes in love scenes.

She was invited to feature in the second series of Channel 4 music comedy We Are Lady Parts, about a rock band.

I was massively stressed out about how we were going to make sure Malala had a good time. “She was so laid back and easy- going. She also has a very dark sense of humour, and she’s so funny.” Olden age of Love Island IS Love Island taking inspiration from fellow dating show My Mum, Your Dad? After Davina McCall's series proved daters with more life experience can create TV gold, ITV has upped its age limit for the Love Island villa. 6 ITV has upped its age limit for the Love Island villa, pictured the newly released cast Credit: ITV The full cast, revealed in The Sun yesterday , are the show’s oldest bunch of sexy singles yet. They include a hairdresser, mental health nurse and a sweet salesman. But they also include footballer Ronnie Vint, 27, and recruiter Munveer Jabbal, 30, who says he is mates with Piers Morgan's son Spencer. Then there’s office worker Patsy Field, 29, and make-up artist Samantha Kenny, 26, also alongside the usual clutch of those in their early twenties. It means the average age of the Islanders in this year’s line-up is 25 – more than two years older than in any other season. A source said: “Two years might not sound like a lot but in Love Island years it really is. “Having the older castmates in the mix will hopefully bring about better conversations, meatier storylines and a lot more drama.” Which is handy, because host Maya Jama has revealed her main goal for this year’s series is more war than peace. Ahead of the launch next Monday at 9pm on ITV1, ITV2 and ITVX, she said: “I’ll be honest, I’m hoping for drama. “I want loads of love and happy couples at the end but I do want to be entertained, so I’m hoping for lots of fiery moments.” So this is going to end I CAN reveal comedy drama This Is Going To Hurt has reached the end of its life, with no plans for a second series.

The US is “fully and completely committed to deterrence by supporting Taiwan militarily, diplomatically and economically,” he said, adding that its resolve to maintain the “status quo” and peace in the Taiwan Strait should not be doubted. “The resoluteness which the United States Congress has behind Taiwan is extremely strong,” McCaul said. Taiwan’s importance lies in its people, democracy, freedom, prosperity, science and technology, and innovation, he said. “And it’s because the people of Taiwan are just like the people of the United States,” he added. McCaul highlighted repeatedly that “deterrence is key,” pledging to “get the weapons you purchase to you as soon as possible.” Asked about the delays in the delivery of weapons by Washington, McCaul said: “We are moving forward on those weapons systems.” It is crucial to let Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) understand that “the risk outweighs the reward” when considering taking military action against Taiwan, he said. McCaul said he hoped the deterrence provided by the US and the support the delegation has shown through its presence in Taiwan would help prevent military conflicts in the region and make Xi realize that “it’s simply not worth it.” Bejing’s military exercises around Taiwan last week sent “a very strong message” to the US, which the delegation would convey to the US Congress and US President Joe Biden, he said. As the US is holding its presidential election in November, McCaul assured Taiwan that “regardless of ... which candidate wins the presidential [election], I do not see that support [for Taiwan] wavering whatsoever.” “We are stronger when we stand together,” he told Lai when the delegation met with the president earlier yesterday. “America is and always will be a reliable partner and no amount of coercion or intimidation will slow down or stop the routine visits by the [US] Congress to Taiwan,” he said. Congratulating Lai on winning the election and taking office, McCaul said that he looked forward to working with the new administration. “I think Taiwan has the right man at the right time in the right place,” he said. Lai thanked the delegation for showing its firm support for Taiwan through the visit and vowed to continue to deepen cooperation with the US and other like-minded countries to safeguard regional peace, stability and prosperity. While Taiwan is bolstering its national defense capabilities, Lai said he hoped the US Congress would continue to assist Taiwan in the effort through legislative actions. “I’m confident that Taiwan-US relations will steadily deepen, leading to ever more fruitful exchanges,” Lai said. The other members of the visiting delegation are Republicans Young Kim and Joe Wilson, and Democrats Jimmy Panetta and Chrissy Houlahan. 新聞來源: TAIPEI TIMES US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul speaks during a press conference following a meeting with President William Lai in Taipei yesterday.Photo: Ben Blanchard, Reuters 不用抽 不用搶 現在用APP看新聞 保證天天中獎 點我下載APP 按我看活動辦法",

Norrie, stuck on a sparsely-populated outside court on a cold and breezy Paris afternoon in a match delayed by rain, lost in five tight sets 4-6 6-3 3-6 7-6 (5) 6-2. The 28-year-old, seeded 32, won five games in a row after trailing 4-1 to take the first set. Twice Norrie led by a set but twice world number 56 Kotov hit back, taking the match to a decider in a tie-break. Kotov raced into a 4-0 lead and Norrie was unable to peg him back as he bowed out at the first-round stage for the first time since 2020. Norrie was joined on the British scrapheap by Harriet Dart, who lost 7-6 (3) 6-4 to Czech 27th seed Linda Noskova. Defeats for Andy Murray and Jack Draper on Sunday means Britain’s hopes in singles now rest with Katie Boulter and Dan Evans, who play their first-round matches on Tuesday.",

        "content": "Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi, has advocated for the abolishment of state Independent Electoral Commissions (INECs). Fagbemi led discussions during Monday’s National Discourse on Nigeria’s Security Challenges and good governance at the local government level in Abuja. Despite constitutional provisions aimed at safeguarding the autonomy of local governments, instances of arbitrary dissolution, abolition, or fragmentation by higher tiers of government, especially State Governments, persist. The provision of the constitution, specifically under Section 162(5-8), regarding the State Joint Local Government Account, has been cited as empowering state assemblies to determine local government revenue allocations. This has led to concerns about state encroachment on local revenues. “Since 1999, there have been numerous cases of state governments hijacking local government revenues. Due to weak constitutional provisions, the existence of local government councils is often controlled by state governments.” “Local government elections lack consistency across Nigeria, with some State Governors dissolving their Councils and appointing Caretaker Committees instead. Moreover, there are numerous instances of abuse of the Joint Account system by various State governments.” “The erosion of financial autonomy within local governments has hampered their capacity to fulfill statutory obligations. Under a genuine federal framework, ensuring robust autonomy for local governments is imperative. Regarding identified implementation challenges of constitutional/legal provisions, this highlights the pressing need for reform.” “One enduring challenge facing Nigeria’s federalism is the continual neglect of granting autonomy to local governments, which constitute the third tier of governance. Despite being constitutionally designated to serve as a vital institutional framework for grassroots service delivery and national development, local government authorities in Nigeria have consistently underperformed in providing essential services to citizens, largely due to their lack of autonomy.” “The 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria did not provide adequately for the political autonomy of the local governments. The resultant effects of these inadequacies are that the state governments have the discretion to determine the nature, content and direction of local government elections and political activities. “The failure of the constitution to articulate a clear line of authorities to both the state and local authorities and the continuing debate over the involvement of state governments in distributing local government allocation from the Federation Account has affected the capacity of LGAs to provide essential services at the grassroots.Rather than function as a tier of government, LGAs have been operating as an appendage of the State governments in Nigeria. “The 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria falls short in delineating the political autonomy of local governments, leading to significant consequences. State governments wield disproportionate influence over local government elections and political affairs, undermining the intended independence. “This ambiguity has blurred lines of authority, fueling ongoing disputes over the allocation of funds from the Federation Account. Consequently, local government authorities struggle to fulfill their mandate, functioning more as extensions of state governments rather than autonomous entities. This structural deficiency hampers the effective delivery of essential services at the grassroots level, perpetuating a system where local governments lack the agency to govern effectively.” “Local government chairmen are always imposed on the people by the State Governors. This erodes the three elements of good governance at the local government level, which are citizens’ participation, transparency and accountability. The imposed chairman will be accountable only to the Governor rather than the people. This results in lack of transparency and non-involvement of the citizens. “High level and rampant corruption.The absence of administrative and fiscal autonomy to LGAs created a dependency situation than independent one conceptualized under a true federal system of Govt. The local governments in many instances have continued to suffer fiscal emasculation in the hands of state governments. In all these unwholesome abuses, Sections 7 and 162 of the 1999 Constitution among others have been an escape route for many State Governments to manipulate the Local government and reduce same to a mere department in the Governors’ office. “State joint local government account (SJLGA) has been the anti-development instrument used to frustrate every progressive and patriotic action to make the Local Government work since the return of the Country to democracy in 1999.And finally, what are the solutions/recommendations to the observed problems/challenges: LGAs are created by the Constitution. ” Accordingly, in a tiered system like ours, constitutional amendment is imperative before a new system of local government administration can be instituted.Good governance at any level of governance is not possible without the transfer of authority, responsibilities, capacity and resources. “This is even more so for the LGAs.Accordingly, constitutional reforms should, among other things, aim to: increase fiscal and administrative autonomy of Local Govt system to enhance its effectiveness and efficiency; fiscal autonomy should be balanced with fiscal restraint by strengthening the internal controls system, processes and infrastructure for public financial management;ensure inclusiveness and citizens participation in the governance of LGAs.allow the legislative arms of local governments to decide what they should do with revenue accruing to them;need to capacitate LGAs for effective governance. Capacity building involves equipping local government officials with the necessary skills and knowledge to perform their duties effectively. control corruption and institute transparency and integrity in financial accountability of LGAs. ” Transparent and accountable governance fosters public trust, while efficient service delivery enhances legitimacy and stability.Investing more in local government administration with institutionalised internal and external oversightEnsure adherence to the rule of law by upholding the principles of justice, fairness, and accountability Conclusion: “The ability of LGAs to perform developmental functions, particularly in a federal system like Nigeria revolves around the nature of the relationship between the federal, state and local government any major reform of the Local Govt System will invariably require the alteration of the Constitution and other incidental legislations touching on Local Government administration.On the other hand, constitutional alteration can only be achieved through consensus building and commonality of purpose between the three tiers, as with the three arms of Government. “We are therefore challenged to play our respective roles, when called upon to do so. The best time to act is now.To achieve this, many experts have proposed that there is need for the scrapping of the state independent electoral commission. Their functions and powers should be transferred to the independent national electoral commission because the state independent electoral commission remain an appendage to every incumbent governor. “I applaud the House of Representatives for taking decisive action to address the core issue affecting local government administration in Nigeria. “This bold initiative reflects a commitment to revitalizing our governance structures, offering hope for resolving persistent security and governance issues. I eagerly anticipate ongoing collaboration with the House leadership and members, as well as with the broader National Assembly, on this vital matter.”",

        "content": "The National Weather Service issued a report at 2:52 p.m. on Monday for strong thunderstorms until 3:45 p.m. for Chautauqua County. Residents can expect wind gusts of up to 40 mph. \"At 2:51 p.m., Doppler radar tracked a strong thunderstorm near Findley Lake, or 21 miles east of Erie, moving northeast at 25 mph,\" states the weather service. \"Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects.\" Locations impacted by the alert include Jamestown, Dunkirk, Fredonia, Westfield, Lakewood, Silver Creek, Falconer, Mayville, Clymer, Long Point State Park, Jamestown West, Chautauqua Institution, Lake Erie State Park, Findley Lake, SUNY Fredonia, Chautauqua, Portland, Sheridan, Ripley and Stockton. This includes the following highways: Interstate 90 between exits 58 and 60. Interstate 86 between exits 4 and 14. According to the weather service, \"If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building. Frequent cloud to ground lightning is occurring with this storm. Lightning can strike 10 miles away from a thunderstorm. Seek a safe shelter inside a building or vehicle. This storm may intensify, so be certain to monitor local radio stations and available television stations for additional information and possible warnings from the National Weather Service. If on or near Chautauqua Lake, get out of the water and move indoors or inside a vehicle. Remember, lightning can strike out to 10 miles from the parent thunderstorm. If you can hear thunder, you are close enough to be struck by lightning. Move to safe shelter now! Do not be caught on the water in a thunderstorm.\" Each year, lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times, with the majority of these electrifying events occurring during the summer months. Unfortunately, lightning is responsible for claiming the lives of approximately 20 people annually, as reported by the weather service. The threat of lightning becomes more pronounced as thunderstorms draw nearer, peaking when the storm is directly overhead and gradually waning as it moves away. To ensure your safety during a thunderstorm, keep these recommendations in mind: 1. Lightning safety plan: 2. Indoors safety measures: 3. Wait for the all-clear: When indoor shelter isn't available: If you find yourself outdoors without access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety: In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, preparedness and vigilance are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of lightning-related incidents and prioritize your safety. Heavy rainfall may lead to flooding if prolonged or if there is excessive runoff. Excessive runoff can be a result of saturated ground and/or rainfall intensity. Follow these recommendations from the weather service to stay safe in heavy rain: Beware of rapid water flow: Maintain safe driving distances: Reduce speed and drive cautiously: Choose your lane wisely: Visibility matters: Watch out for slippery roads: Keep a safe distance from large vehicles: Mind your windshield wipers: By following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down. Stay informed about weather conditions and heed advice from local authorities to make your journey safe and sound.

        "content": ": The Andhra Pradesh High Court has reserved its verdict for Tuesday on Macherla MLA Pinnellii Ramakrishna Reddy’s plea for anticipatory bail. A single judge bench headed by Justice Venkata Jyothirmai Pratapa held the hearing here on Monday on an implead- petition filed by advocate Posani Venkateswarlu on behalf of petitioners/complainants Namburi Seshagiri Rao and Cherukuri Siromani. He argued that the legislator’s criminal history must be taken into consideration and allowing the accused to enter the counting centre on the counting would not be good. If the legislator was granted anticipatory bail, he would threaten the witnesses and even tamper with the evidence, the court was told on behalf of the petitioners. Public prosecutor for the police argued that there was a chance the legislator would resort to violence at the time of counting of votes as he broke the EVMs on the day of polling. The legislator was involved in nine cases and even flouted the court directions and evaded the police vigil, the court heard. He added, “The police filed a memo in the court at 8pm on May 23, stating that the legislator was an accused in the attack on CI Narayana Swamy.” Pinnelli Ramakrishna Reddy’s counsel Niranjan Reddy submitted to the court that his client was supposed to appoint agents for counting of votes on June 4 and sought temporary relief from his arrest. He argued that though the HC had given protection to the legislator from arrest in a case of breaking the EVMs, the police subsequently booked several cases against him “in order to arrest him.” He urged the court to give an interim order providing the legislator protection from the arrest up to June 6. After hearing both the parties, the court decided to deliver its order on Tuesday.",

        "content": "A MISSING boy's mom had a sharp temper and once warned she was capable of doing anything when she wasn't on her medication, his family says. Amy Fry-Pitzen died by suicide in May 2011 after embarking on a three-day road trip from Aurora, Illinois, with her 6-year-old son, Timmothy Pitzen . The 43-year-old, who had long suffered from mental health struggles, was found dead in a $40-per-night motel room in Rockford. But there was no sign of Timmothy in the room and many of his belongings were missing as well, including toys and his beloved Spider-Man backpack. The only clues as to his whereabouts were shared by Amy in her parting words, writing in a suicide note that she'd given him away to someone who loved him and he would never be found. Amy and Timmothy's dad, Jim Pitzen, had hit a rough patch in their marriage before her death, with Jim seeking to divorce her and take full custody of their son. In her suicide note – which has never been released publicly – Amy voiced several derogatory remarks about Jim and said she intended to hurt him \"worse than you hurt me,\" he previously shared . In the days after her death, two more letters arrived in the mail addressed to her mom and a friend, in which Amy wrote that she was sorry and did not feel like she \"ever belonged in the world.\" \"I've taken him somewhere safe,\" she wrote in the letter to her mom. \"He will be well cared for and he says that he loves you. Please know that there is nothing you could have said or done that would have changed my mind.\" Timmothy's family members on both sides have spent the last 13 years torturing themselves to decode the meaning of Amy's cryptic last words. One thing they all resoundingly agree on is that Amy would never hurt her son. Both Timmothy's grandma, Linda Pitzen, and aunt, Jen West , told The U.S. Sun in separate interviews that Timmothy was Amy's world and they believe she gave him away to another family. However, they both also shared that Amy had a quick and fearsome temper, with Linda remembering a particularly chilling remark Amy once shared with her that disturbs her in hindsight. \"Amy had a very sharp temper,\" said Linda. \"Sometimes I could be playing with [Timmothy] and doing something that was fine and the next time it wasn't fine, but I think that had a lot to do with her mental depression. \"She once told me if she wasn't on her meds then she was capable of anything, which kind of frightened me. \"She was trying to find something happy and I think Tim did that for her until he started growing up and becoming more independent, and then the depression came back. Linda continued, \"But she always put Timm first. \"I think she was searching for answers in herself and just wasn’t able to find what she was looking for.\" The last known images of Timmothy alive were captured on a surveillance camera as he and Amy checked out of a water park hotel resort in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin , on May 13, 2011, an hour north of Madison. Two days before, Amy had taken Timmothy out of school early, telling administrators there had been a family emergency. The pair then spent the next two days embarking on a road trip, visiting zoos and water parks across state lines. While it appeared Amy had been planning the trip for some time, it came as a complete surprise to her husband Jim who arrived at the school on May 11 to collect the boy, only to be told he'd already left with Amy. For 48 hours, Amy aired dozens of frantic calls and texts from Jim and other family members who were trying desperately to track them down. She finally broke her silence on the afternoon of May 13 when she called her mom, and Jim's brother, informing them both she'd be home soon. Timmothy was heard chattering in the background of the calls and even spoke over the receiver. In her call with Jim's brother, Amy asked, \"What, don't you trust me?\" \"Timmothy belongs to me [...] I'm not going to hurt myself. I'm not going to hurt Tim.\" Moments later, Amy's phone would be turned off for the last time. The last cellphone ping from Amy's phone was registered in Sterling, Illinois, a small rural town about 80 miles west of Aurora. Records from Amy's I-Pass would later reveal that she made two prior trips to Sterling in February and March 2011. There’s 13 years that have passed, and those would’ve been very formative years. But there’s a lot left if we could just find him. Or if he can find us. Where she headed after Sterling remains a mystery, as do the reasons for her prior visits to the remote town, to which she had no known connections. Had Amy found someone to illegally adopt Timmothy and arranged to meet them near Sterling? Or had she done something to the boy that she never wanted anyone to find out about and buried the evidence where nobody would ever find him? Police have explored both theories extensively but are no closer to proving either hypothesis. A forensic examination of Amy's computers, phones, and financial records yielded no evidence of a secret adoption. But despite the lack of evidence, and the fact there have been no concrete sightings of Timmothy in the years since, Linda Pitzen believes her daughter-in-law was telling the truth when she said she'd given the boy away. Linda can't be sure where Timmothy is now, but she believes whatever happened may have had something to do with Amy's Mormon beliefs . \"I think she wanted Timm to be raised Mormon,\" said Linda. \"The rest of us aren't Mormon and I think this was her way of making sure he was after she'd gone. \"She never pushed it on anyone apart from Jim. But he was reluctant and I think her church may have been pushing her a little, I don't know. \"But she went to a Mormon church. She wasn't raised that way, she was a convert – and that was before Jim had met her.\" One of Timmothy's elementary school classmates, Hannah Soukup, told The U.S. Sun earlier this month that she believes Timmothy is being kept in a remote religious commune with limited access to the internet and the outside world. \"I believe she dropped him off somewhere – I don't know if it was in a religious area, or something like that – but I think she dropped him off and gave him to people she knew would keep him safe and hidden,\" theorized Soukup. \"And I think she made it clear that either his identity had to be changed or that he had to stay away from the internet so he'd never know he was missing.\" Linda Pitzen said she has long shared the same theory. \"I’ve agreed with that theory from the beginning,\" said Linda. \"I read that suicide note, and if you read that note and you know her, I would guess she probably gave somebody to live in a compound. \"I have to hope that's true because it'd be a lot better option for me to deal with, as opposed to what the other options are.\" Authorities have admitted they have very few leads to go on in their initial search for Timmothy, with the trail of their investigation quickly growing cold. By Luke Kenton, senior exclusives reporter, who has been covering the Pitzen case for five years. It was on April 3, 2019, when I was first made aware of Timmothy Pitzen's puzzling case. There was news breaking out of Newport, Kentucky, that a young and distressed-seeming individual had approached a lady on the street and identified himself as Timmothy, a 14-year-old boy who'd vanished from Illinois almost eight years ago. 'Timmothy' would later tell police he'd managed to escape from two sexually abusive kidnappers who'd been holding him hostage and \"passing him around\" since 2011. He described his captors as white with \"body-builder\" physiques and claimed the men had recently been holding him at a Red Rock Inn motel in Cincinnati, Ohio. The individual correctly stated Timmothy's full name, date of birth, and details about his upbringing. He said he spotted an opportunity to escape his captors, ran across a bridge connecting Ohio and Kentucky, and didn't stop for two hours before alerting a woman in Newport. News of the remarkable development filled family members with hope that Timmothy was finally about to return home after an agonizing years-long wait. \"We hope it’s true,\" Amy's sister, Kara Jacobs, told local media. \"What’s hard is the story that he escaped from his captors. And your mind goes in too many directions that you don’t want to think about. \"'And what I’ve prayed about since he’s been gone is that God will keep him close and take care of him and that maybe by some stroke of luck, he was with people who would love him. And if that’s not the case, it will be heartbreaking to get through.\" But the family's burgeoning flame of optimism was suddenly extinguished in a cruel and sudden gust. After being questioned by police, the individual was taken to a local children's hospital for a DNA test. There he admitted to his true identity; he was not the missing boy as he'd claimed but instead a mentally disturbed 23-year-old named Brian Rini who had a lengthy criminal record and a history of lying to police. Rini – who had twice before made false claims of being a juvenile sex trafficking victim – was initially charged with identity fraud and lying to the FBI for his sick Pitzen ruse. The delinquent later admitted to having recently learned of Timmothy's case during an episode of ABC's 20/20 and memorized his full name, date of birth, and other details to dupe investigators. His reason for doing so, he claimed, was that he \"wished he had a father like Timmothy's because if he went missing, his father would just keep drinking,\" court documents show. Rini struck a plea deal with prosecutors which saw his lying charge dropped in exchange for an admission of guilt. Timmothy's grandma, Linda Pitzen, and his aunt, Jen West, both told The U.S. Sun that Rini's hoax was devastating and difficult to process. However, they found a silver lining in the dense cloud of grief cast by Rini because their beloved Timmothy was thrust back into the limelight and his name and likeness into the public consciousness. \"It was hard but I still feel like that sick hoax helped our case,\" said Linda. \"I think when we put out the information each year, it gets out and people still recognize him as that little boy from Aurora, even though he'd be a grown man now.\" Similarly, Jen remarked, \"Now I'll speak to anyone about the case because you never know which interview, TV show, or other communication will be the right one that sets everything into motion and brings him home. \"It's a s**tty lottery but we kind of won the lottery of sensationalism and people want to know about the case. \"Keeping his story and name alive is half of the battle [...] we know he's out there somewhere.\" Hundreds of officers, a canine team, and a search plane had descended on Sterling in the aftermath of his disappearance but came up empty-handed. Law enforcement likened the search to a hunt for a needle in a haystack and admitted they lacked any solid evidence to help narrow its scale. In a statement to The U.S. Sun last week, Aurora police said its officers remain committed to solving the case. \"Over the years, the department has received and investigated several tips and theories from the community. Unfortunately, none of those have resulted in Timmothy being located,\" wrote Lieutenant Joseph Howe, adding the case is active and ongoing. \"The case is assigned to an APD investigator who continues to review the case to ensure all leads have been pursued and all evidence has been properly evaluated.\" The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children also helps the Aurora Police Department sift through leads and investigate any reported sightings. This year, the organization released a new computer-generated image showing what Timmothy might look like today. If he is still alive, Timmothy would be 19 years old. Seeing the computer-generated image of her grandson for the first time stirred deep emotions for Linda, who wanted to reach through the screen to embrace him. \"I like the fact that he's got reddish brown hair because he had reddish brown hair and he had [...] light freckles. So I like that a lot,\" she said. \"He's handsome. Very handsome. I would love to hug him but I don’t know if that’ll ever happen. \"There’s 13 years that have passed, and those would’ve been very formative years,\" added Linda. \"But there’s a lot left if we could just find him. \"Or if he can find us.\" May 11, 2011: Timmothy's mom, Amy Fry-Pitzen, picked him up from school at Greenman Elementary in Aurora, Illinois, at around 8:15 am citing an unspecified family emergency. The boy's dad, Jim Pitzen, appeared at the school to pick him up at the end of the day and was confused when he was told by administrators Timmothy had been collected by Amy that morning. Calls and texts to Amy's phone went unanswered and Jim began to panic. In the meantime, Timmothy and his mom went to Brookfield Zoo and later headed to Key Lime Resort in Gurnee, a hotel and waterpark. May 12, 2011: Amy and Timmothy went to the Wisconsin Dells and the pair checked into the Kalahari Resort, stopping to buy clothes and other items along the way. Jim reported Timmothy missing to police in Aurora after failing to make contact with Amy for almost 24 hours. Police did not issue an Amber Alert because Amy hadn't yet committed a crime and Timmothy wasn't suspected of being in danger. May 13, 2011: Amy and Timmothy are captured together on surveillance video for the last time, checking out of the Kalahari resort. While driving toward Sterling, Amy contacted various family members but not her husband. She assured them Timmothy was fine and nothing appeared odd in her behavior, those contacted would later tell police. The boy was heard in the background of the call and on at least one occasion spoke on the line. Amy then turned her cellphone off after driving 170 miles along the Rock River and her movements for the next several hours remain a total mystery 13 years on. She finally re-emerged several hours later, alone, at a grocery store in Winnebago near Rockford at 8 pm, where she stopped to buy supplies that would be used to craft her cryptic suicide note. May 14, 2011: Amy is found dead in a hotel room at the Rockford Inn by a maid just after 12:30 pm. She left behind a suicide note apologizing for the mess and warning that Timmothy was safe but would never be found. The boy's beloved Spider-Man backpack was missing from the room, along with a handful of his belongings. May 19, 2011: More than 70 volunteers begin searching for Timmothy in the Sterling and Rock Falls area but come up empty-handed. June 14, 2011: Police conceded they have very little evidence to go on in their search for Timmothy and began examining dirt found beneath Amy's car. August 11, 2011: Police confirm a small amount of Timmothy's blood was found in Amy's SUV but state it could've been the result of a bloody nose. December 28, 2011: A sighting of Timmothy in a car was reported at a Denny's in North Aurora but the report turned out to be false. Another tip earlier in the month also falsely claimed the boy had been spotted in Massachusetts. Aurora police said they fielded dozens of possible sightings, all of which were false and most were easily dismissed. April 3, 2019: A boy wandering the streets alone in Newport, Kentucky, claimed to a passerby he'd just escaped his two captors and he was Timmothy Pitzen who vanished from Illinois eight years earlier. Police were called but the boy turned out to be a mentally ill hoaxer named Brian Rini who had recently watched a documentary about the case and decided to impersonate him.",

        "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology could offer companionship to lonely people amid an international epidemic of loneliness, says a robotics expert. Tony Prescott, a professor of cognitive robotics at the University of Sheffield, argues in his new book \" The Psychology of Artificial Intelligence \" that \"relationships with AIs could support people\" with forms of social interaction. Loneliness has been found to seriously impair human health , and Professor Prescott makes a case that advances in AI technology could offer a partial solution. He argues that people can spiral into loneliness, becoming increasingly disconnected as their confidence plummets, and that AI might help people to \"break the cycle\" by giving them a way to practice and improve their social skills. Loneliness—or social disconnection—is more harmful to human health than obesity, according to a 2023 report . A 2015 study showed it can increase the risk of premature death by 26% and is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia, stroke, depression and anxiety. The extent of the problem is striking: In the U.K. 3.8 million people are experiencing chronic loneliness. A Harvard study in the U.S. found that 36% of US adults—and 61% of young adults—experience serious loneliness. Professor Prescott says, \"In an age when many people describe their lives as lonely, there may be value in having AI companionship as a form of reciprocal social interaction that is stimulating and personalized. Human loneliness is often characterized by a downward spiral in which isolation leads to lower self-esteem , which discourages further interaction with people. \"There may be ways in which AI companionship could help break this cycle by scaffolding feelings of self-worth and helping maintain or improve social skills. If so, relationships with AIs could support people to find companionship with both human and artificial others.\" He does suggest this is not without risk, however, as it could be \"designed to encourage users to interact for longer and longer periods and to keep them coming back,\" and suggests regulation may be needed. Prescott is a leading expert on the relationship between the human brain and AI, combining expertise in robotics and AI with psychology and philosophy. He contributes to the scientific understanding of the human condition by researching the re-creation of perception, memory, and emotion in synthetic entities. As well as researching and teaching cognitive robotics at the University of Sheffield, Prescott is also the co-founder of Sheffield Robotics, which is a hub for robotics research . In \"The Psychology of Artificial Intelligence,\" Prescott explores the nature of the human mind and its cognitive processes and compares and contrasts this with the way AI is developing. The book explores questions including: He concludes, \"As psychology and AI proceed, this partnership should unlock further insights into both natural and artificial intelligence . This could help answer some key questions about what it means to be human and for humans to live alongside AI.\" More information: Tony Prescott, The Psychology of Artificial Intelligence (2024).

        "content": "Dear Readers: Memorial Day is a federal holiday in the United States for honoring and mourning the U.S. military personnel who died while serving in the United States Armed Forces. “Vigil Strange I Kept on the Field One Night” by Walt Whitman “Vigil strange I kept on the field one night; / When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day, / One look I but gave which your dear eyes return’d with a look I shall never forget, / One touch of your hand to mine O boy, reach’d up as you lay on the ground, / Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle, / Till late in the night reliev’d to the place at last again I made my way, / Found you in death so cold dear comrade, found your body son of responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,) / Bared your face in the starlight, curious the scene, cool blew the moderate night-wind, / Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the battle-field spreading, / Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night, / But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh, long, long I gazed, / Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my chin in my hands, / Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you dearest comrade -- not a tear, not a word, / Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son and my soldier, / As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole, / Vigil final for you brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was your death, / I faithfully loved you and cared for you living, I think we shall surely meet again,) / Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn appear’d, / My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop’d well his form, / Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head and carefully under feet, / And there and then and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his grave, in his rude-dug grave I deposited, / Ending my vigil strange with that, vigil of night and battle-field dim, / Vigil for boy of responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,) / Vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil I never forget, how as day brighten’d, / I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his blanket, / And buried him where he fell.” “The Fallen” by Randall W. West, courtesy of Family Friend Poems “Fragile is a single life the brave so freely give. / Bound for immortality, their souls will surely live. / Death, don’t be proud for what you took, they freely gave away. / Their quest for freedom far outweighed the fear that you convey. / They joined the ranks of warriors, staying vigil day and night. / They often skipped a meal or two, but they never missed a fight. / God bless the men and women whose fighting days are done. / Say a special prayer at night for each and every one. / Rest assured that you will find throughout the coming years / These fallen warriors will return in the hearts of all their peers! / If we forget their sacrifice, their deaths will be in vain. / Let’s stand beside their loved ones as we sing their last refrain: / You’ve come upon our heaven’s gate / You surely won’t have long to wait. / The saints will take good care of you, / But there is still a lot to do. / You’ve joined the ranks of everyone / Who fought so freedom could be won. / Although your job on earth is done, / Your work in heaven’s just begun.”",

        "content": "Revealed: American TV presenter whose flirty interview with Rory McIlroy sent tongues wagging gushed over football coach husband in engagement announcement two years ago READ Rory McIlroy and sports journalist Amanda Balionis spark romance rumors By Alison Boshoff and Daniel Bates Published: 19:43 BST, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 20:08 BST, 27 May 2024 e-mail 14 View comments Almost exactly two years ago, rising TV star Amanda Balionis could not possibly have looked any happier. Showing off an impressive diamond engagement ring, and with her arms wrapped around her long time boyfriend, she wrote: 'Hey @BrynRenner. Forever sounds kinda perfect.' She and Renner, a sports star turned football coach, had a beautiful beach wedding on December 3, 2022 in La Jolla – San Diego's 'jewel by the sea.' At the lavish wedding they posed in front of a neon sign reading 'The Renners' and the bride and groom wore matching Nike hi-top sneakers in the colours of his football team. She even used their hashtag 'Go Heels' in honour of her groom. Spool forward 14 months, though, and quite surprisingly given those recent romantic declarations her wedding ring was off. Her hyphenated family name – 'Balionis-Renner' – was also no longer being used. Plain Amanda Balionis went on a girls trip to Las Vegas and then two skiing trips in quick succession, again in an all-girls gaggle both times. Almost exactly two years ago, rising TV star Amanda Balionis could not possibly have looked any happier in her engagement photo Rory McIlroy and CBS reporter Amanda Balionis are pictured together And then on May 12, beneath an Instagram picture of her interviewing golf superstar Rory McIlroy on CBS, a friend, Camille Stroud, wrote: 'You two' alongside a heart emoji. It was at this point, that suspicions started to take root about just what was going on between sparkly Balionis, who has worked across CBS' golf input since 2017, and the just-divorcing Rory McIlroy, a £225 million sportsman. He announced on Monday May 13, quite unexpectedly, that his seven year marriage to pretty Erica Stoll had irretrievably broken down. They have a three-year-old daughter, Poppy. But it seems that while he and Stoll were on the outs – while he and Amanda Balionis were apparently drawing ever closer. So who is the woman who has caught Rory's eye? Balionis is the daughter of Tony, who died in 2019, and Dana, both avid golf players. She used to take her father on in putting games – playing for quarters. Mother Dana told Fore magazine a year ago: 'She'd say, 'I like it, but volleyball is more exciting. She was just so active. Golf was never active enough for her.' She added: 'She's never loved golf more than she does now.' She made her debut for CBS Sports show The 19th Hole at the 2017 Genesis Open at Riviera CC, and now she does interviews and analysis at all of the tour events for the network. She has also done NFL and college football sideline reporting, and was CBS's first-ever social media reporter for the Superbowl. The flirty banter was evident during the Wells Fargo Championship on Mother's Day, May 12 She has a degree in broadcasting from Hofstra University in New York and worked her way up to the big leagues by covering high school sports on digital platforms and on cable. Her big break came when she was working in the media department of the sporting goods manufacturers Callaway and was asked to present a slot on CBS. She said: 'The nerves were insane, but there was also this feeling that I had worked so hard for this. I had kind of given up on the dream, and I thought, 'I'm going to be live on CBS for at least one time, so, technically, I achieved my dream.' The chairman of CBS Sports Sean McManus believes she is a breath of fresh air who adds a 'different perspective.' He went on: 'She has a lot of credibility with golfers, and they respond well to her.' Read More EXCLUSIVE Rory McIlroy and CBS sports journalist Amanda Balionis spark romance rumors in wake of his divorce from wife Erica Stoll with flirty TV interviews after married reporter ditches her ring The job is to interview live without a prompter or notes, and to strike a friendly enough tone to put the golf stars at their ease. A source at CBS who knows Amanda well said: 'Amanda has always wanted to be on television. It's her dream. She's very likeable but one of the most ambitious people I've met. I've known her for a long time. She won't mind having her name linked to the story because of the profile it's giving her. I know she'll be loving it. I don't mean that cruelly. She's a nice girl, but she's ambitious. This will give her a leg up.' The source added: 'Before all this, I wouldn't have said they were any closer than she is with other players. She's got a flirty nature, which works well on television. She has chats with the players. I guess she and Rory get on well, but I don't know whether they're in a relationship or not.' Her mum Dana told Fore: 'It's really been amazing. Just all of the twists and turns to get to where she is. It's been one crazy thing after another. The stars just kept lining up.' In April this year, two months after Balionis apparently split from her husband, McIlroy took time out of his busy schedule to film a short video supporting Puppies & Golf, the non-profit founded by Balionis in 2020 and aimed at advocating for rescue dogs, rehousing and in some instances retraining them as support animals for veterans. Then on Sunday May 12th, the two seemed warmly at ease in each other's company, even flirtatious. Balionis asked him in a TV interview: 'What gear did you have to find to assert your dominance once more over Quail Hollow?' Later, she asked him to tell her: 'Physically how good your game feels.' It was an account on Twitter which first made explicit the inference of coupledom hinted at by Balionis' pal Camille Stroud. On May 16th a post ran: 'So Rory was possibly getting with Amanda Balionis from CBS. It's a rumour I heard from the divorce. That would be a spicy meatball if true. I like both of them. Maybe I made it up.' This was followed the next day by a blind item on the gossip site DeuxMoi which then started circulating widely on Twitter including via the anonymous' LIV insider' account. The anonymous DeuxMoi item said that the golfer had been spotted: 'all around San Diego. More specifically...the Crown Point neighborhood of Pacific Beach.'The neighborhood, more than 2,500 miles from McIlroy's home in Jupiter, Florida, is where Balionis lives in a two-bed home she bought for $789,000 in 2020. According to the source: 'My sister was at a restaurant, and he came in to pick up a 'to go' and used the name 'Amanda' as the pick-up. He paid cash – only a few people noticed him, and he was out!' Initially, people couldn't quite believe that it was true. However as time passes, without any comment from McIlroy's management or Ms Balionis' flack at 42 West, the rumours have started to be treated as fact. McIlroy, pictured with his now estranged wife Erica Stoll at the Rider Cup in September, recently announced he has filed divorce after seven years of marriage It would be normal for untrue reports to be denied. This week Dottie Pepper, a pro golfer who now works alongside Balionis covering the sport, said: 'No! Absolutely not! No!' when asked if she had any comment on her colleague being an item with Rory McIlroy. Darren Heitner, a lawyer who plays golf with Balionis estranged husband Bryn Renner similarly declined to comment rather than issue any denial. One senior source on the golf tour says: 'It was totally news to the TV crowd if it has been going on. Her co workers are as surprised as anyone else. Clearly they have kept it extremely discreet.' He added: 'It's not one of those affairs where everyone knows about it and you are just waiting for it to come out. 'The first anyone was really aware was from a Tweet. It was from an anonymous source so nobody really was sure how much notice to pay to it, but then it got bigger and bigger online until it came out as a story in the end. 'That's not to say that nothing was going on, but just that this was no Tiger Woods type situation. Everyone was actually quite surprised that the marriage had broken down in the first place. He is not one of the golfers who has a reputation for womanising at all.' You might think that's a curious thing to say as McIlroy famously broke tennis player Caroline Wozniaki's heart when he dumped her just after she had sent out wedding invitations. Balionis was last pictured wearing her wedding ring on Instagram in early February He also had a high profile romance with model Nadia Forde, and was linked even to Meghan Markle, pre Prince Harry. But in the context of the bunkers and bunk ups world of international golf, that makes him pretty much one of the innocents. Take Tiger Woods. The golfer reportedly confessed to sleeping with 120 women during his marriage to former nanny Elin Nordgren. Apparently she only decided that she was going to leave him almost a year after the first scandal erupted ...when the daughter of their neighbours was named as his 15th mistress. A veteran writer said: 'I could name you three players who have been the best players in the world who had that exactly the same lifestyle, the same numbers and everything as Tiger Woods. Actually, two of them used to compete with each other to see how many women they could sleep with. It's nothing new in golf. They are young rich good looking and on the road for months, and many of the golf wives just turn a blind eye.' As the late golf commentator Peter Alliss sardonically put it: 'Tiger failed the eleventh commandment 'Thou shalt not be found out'. During golf tournaments, there is a lively social scene. The players and their entourages can be found in hotel bars or local restaurants as the tour moves internationally. Organisations like the PGA habitually employ pretty young golf fans to do administrative roles. Sponsors similarly send teams of attractive women who orbit the players. Some wives insist on coming with their husbands so that they can keep an eye on what goes on at the bar, but often once there are children who need to be in school, this falls away – meaning that the husbands spend most of the year separated from their wives and families. No wonder that the sport is such a matrimonial graveyard. Rory McIlroy met New York born wife Erica Stoll through the game. He overslept during the 2012 Ryder Cup and nearly missed his tee time. Erica, who was working on PGA transportation, arranged a police escort to get him to the course in Medinah, Illinois, in time. They kept on bumping into each other as Stoll continued to work for the PGA and the couple started dating at the end of 2014, after his split from Wozniacki. They got engaged in Paris a year later and were married in 2017 at the 13th-century Ashford Castle in County Ma y o , with guests including actor Jamie Dornan, who grew up in the same town as McIlroy, One Direction's Niall Horan and Coldplay musician Chris Martin. Ed Sheeran and Stevie Wonder provided the entertainment. The celebrations were said to have cost £400,000. Home was a £7 million nine-bedroom, ten-bathroom mansion in Florida's exclusive Bear's Club gated community, founded by golf legend Jack Nicklaus, where basketball star Michael Jordan and tennis sisters Venus and Serena Williams are neighbours. There was also property in Wentworth, Surrey, the home of European golf, where he and Erica were said to have spent £10million on renovations. The thinking was that the family would take up full-time residence there when Poppy was ready for secondary school. Sadly, it has all fallen apart long before she reached that milestone. A source told US Weekly magazine said that Stoll felt 'lonely' in the marriage as they were effectively leading separate lives. The source said: 'She knew what she was getting into with his profession, but once they had Poppy, things really changed, and she had a new perspective. Erica was usually absent for most of his tournaments and was really focused on Poppy.' Another potential factor in the end of the marriage - other than the constant travelling and temptations – is McIlroy's role in the schism which split the game, when the Saudi-backed LIV golf set up as a rival to the PGA tour in 2022. McIlroy was the figurehead for the PGA, and strongly backed the tour. In the second series of the Netflix documentary Full Swing, filmed last summer, you see McIlroy sacrificing his own game in order to stand up for what he believes in. He muses on how 'off' his game is, confessing: ': 'I s**t myself with left pins. My technique isn't anywhere near where it used to be.' And he tells the documentary: 'It's all consuming. It's a full time job playing golf and having all the other stuff. You get fatigued. I had to ask myself a lot of questions. It's so difficult.' Just before the US Open he discovers that the warring sides have come to an agreement – and he didn't even know that the announcement was coming. 'Why did I waste 12 months of my life to fight for something that was always going to come back together again?' he says. There was widespread sympathy for Rory McIlroy on the circuit – and its no surprise that some of it came from Amanda Balionis. She tells the doc: 'It's so rare that PGA tour players take on the responsibility that we've seen Rory McIlroy take on. 'How can he be so invested into what's going on between LIV and the PGA Tour and go out there and beat the other 150 best players in the world? That's not a sustainable place to live of an already full plate and putting the PGA Tour on your back.' Did this sympathy blossom into love? Certainly there are signs that they started to become more closely aligned. Another source who is close to McIlroy said: 'No one will be surprised that Rory has someone else lined up. It's textbook behaviour. Look back at his love life. This isn't a guy who likes to be alone. The next conquest ALWAYS appears before the current one goes. I've known the guy a long time, and there is always an overlap. He added: 'I think he and Amanda are close, and there are lots of rumours circulating, but I've not seen them together. I tell you what, though, I wouldn't be surprised – she's his type. 'She's blonde which is his preference. I was very close to Rory when his relationship with Caroline ended, and we were telling him not to be rash. But he was desperate to move on once he'd made the decision. He'd decided he wanted someone who was homely and not dashing around all over the place at sports events. Now he's bored with homely and is bound to go for someone dashing around all over the place and going to sports events. It's funny, really. Caroline must be laughing her socks off.'

        "content": "White Sox manager Pedro Grifol didn’t back down. His players held their position, too. Grifol on Sunday said his team was ‘F—ing flat in a loss to the Orioles. On Monday, he was asked to revisit his take when told his players didn’t agree. “I’m doubling down on what I said yesterday,” Grifol said. “I thought we were flat. And that’s where I’m going to leave it. We have to make adjustments today, OK. And go out there and play the game as hard as we can.” The Sox took a 15-39 record into their Memorial Day game against the Blue Jays Monday, a history-making won-lost subjecting Grifol to critics even though injuries to Luis Robert Jr., Yoan Moncada and Eloy Jimenez have depleted his ranks. Those three comprised the core of a lineup that wasn’t expected to push the Sox out of 100-loss territory even if healthy. Grifol’s calling out players is a reversal of the second-year skipper’s normal tactics, though, especially when it comes to veteran players. This holiday weekend back-and-forth and the questions of player-manager dynamics is testing the sturdiness of the Sox’ on-field operation. Players say they’re unified. Grifol said there is unity between his office and the players’ room. “This is a close clubhouse,” second baseman Nicky Lopez said. “They have their opinions. I have mine,” Grifol said. \"[But] this is not divided by any means. This is not them against Pedro, Pedro against them. It’s just a situation. I thought we were flat. They didn’t think we were flat. It’s over.” After Korey Lee and Garrett Crochet echoed the prevailing feeling in the room, however – that the Sox ran into a buzzsaw in Orioles right-hander Kyle Brandish, who tossed seven innings of no-hit ball at them – Gavin Sheets and Lopez suggested it wasn’t completely over by saying the same thing. “I thought we ran into a pretty good pitcher yesterday with really good stuff,” Sheets said Monday. “[Orioles catcher James] McCann was like ‘he was as good as I’ve seen him.’ I thought we attacked. We had a game plan.” Grifol’s take did not go over well in the clubhouse. “I just know that I’ve been fortunate enough to be in this league for five years now, I’ve had four different managers and all of them are different,” Lopez said. “The way they handle things is obviously going to be different. “Obviously it’s been a tough year for all of us, so some people handle that differently, as players do, as managers do, as coaches do. I think that’s just one of the things. We’ve battling and grinding, busting our butt, and yesterday we didn’t have much going. He’s the manager, he’s entitled to do what he wants to do. It’s our job to go out there and play.” Grifol said he has extreme patience when it comes to development, improvement and adjustments, “but I don’t have any patience for not cherishing every single day you get to put on a major-league uniform. Zero.” Asked to be more precise about what he meant by flat, Grifol wouldn’t get into specifics. “Look, I’m not going to get into what flat looks like and it doesn’t look like,” he said. “Everybody who saw the game yesterday is going to have their own opinion. I had mine. Ok. That’s pretty simple. I’m done with the flat. I’m done with the energy. I’ve already addressed it. They’ve addressed it. I’m not going to continue to address that. “You can’t take days off. You can’t do it. Mentally and physically. “We’ve had games where we started off a little slow and then we just pick it up. I’m OK with that, because that’s part of the grind. And I’m OK with maybe an individual going through something and it takes him a little bit and then OK, we pick it up. But you’re playing one of the best teams in baseball [the Orioles], and you’ve got a guy on the mound that’s really damn good [Garrett Crochet] for us. And he’s giving us an opportunity to win. And it’s not about losing the game, it’s about doing whatever it takes to try to win the baseball game, energy-wise, and I didn’t feel we had it. That’s it.”",

        "content": "JAKE PAUL has hit out after Mike Tyson's latest health scare. The 'baddest man on the planet' required medical treatment on board a flight from Miami to LA after suffering an ulcer flare up. 3 Jake Paul has rubbished Mike Tyson's latest health scare Credit: Getty 3 Tyson became ill on a flight because of an ulcer flare up Credit: Getty Tyson became nauseous and dizzy in the latest health setback for the 57-year-old. He has suffered from sciatica for several years which has left him using a cane and even a wheelchair on occasion. But Paul rubbished Tyson's latest health problem just weeks ahead of their showdown in the ring. He tweeted on X: \"You love to make s*** up before knowing the facts for clicks/likes. Nothing changed #PaulTyson\" Tyson is 31 years older than Paul and UFC commentator Joe Rogan fears he could die after facing the YouTuber. Tyson, however, has tried to dispel fears for his safety with a series of clips of him ferociously hitting the pads. He also sent a chilling warning to his opponent, saying: \"Once he’s in that ring, he has to fight like his life is depending on it. Because it will be.” Tyson has also labelled Paul \"fat\" after he bulked up to heavyweight size, with Paul confessing he is now struggling to run.

        "description": "Several concert-goers said they aren't going back to the music festival until their safety concerns are addressed.",
        "content": "For some Boston Calling concert-goers, the last day of the festival quickly turned from a fun day to a safety concern. Aubrey Kelly and Samantha Baron — who only attended on the sold-out Sunday — said they felt unsafe trying to watch the performances. “There was just nowhere to go. So everyone was just kind of being like moved in a wave. And all I could think was, if God forbid there was some kind of panic that we were going to get trampled,” Baron said. There were around 40,000 attendees compared to roughly 16,000 on Saturday, according to Boston.com . Boston Calling, Harvard University police, Boston Emergency Medical Services and Boston Police didn’t respond to requests for information or comment. Kelly said they were shoved and body slammed while in the crowd. At the same time, Baron said she witnessed security trying to get through but were unable to. The sold-out day had several notable acts including Hozier, The Killers, Megan Thee Stallion and Chappell Roan who all performed on two main stages next to each other — some only a few minutes apart. Baron, who has gone to the festival in 2015 and 2023, said there was a notable difference in attendee size compared to years past. Kelly and Baron said that even though they weren’t close to the stage for Megan Thee Stallion, they felt unsafe and tried to get out of the crowd to hear The Killers from far away. “We were too scared to get much closer. We stayed in the back the rest of the time. We stayed closer to the exit. We were more careful,” Baron said. Baron and Kelly said they also had trouble accessing restrooms and water stations because of not being able to move throughout the festival grounds. POV: You leave Boston Calling after a soldout show 😳 #masslive #boston #bostoncalling Saffron Donovan, a seven-year Boston Calling volunteer, said she has never seen Boston Calling so crowded. “I’ve never seen it as crazy unsafe packed as it was yesterday. Even a couple years ago we had Metallica headline one night and that brought in a massive massive crowd but that was nowhere near as unsafe feeling as between Megan Thee Stallion and Hozier yesterday,” Donovan said. Donovan said she didn’t think Boston Calling was fully prepared for how many people would attend the festival. Donovan said Saturday looked completely different with the ability to freely walk around the festival grounds and enough space for concert-goers to be able to cartwheel. She said there weren’t any additional safety trainings or precautions given to her besides the basic training manual for the day. “I don’t think they were purposefully not giving us information. I think it just wasn’t expected,” Donovan said. Donovan said Boston Calling has “outgrown” the Harvard Athletic Complex and needs to transition to a bigger venue space. She said if the festival were to stay there, it would need more designated exits and more planning would be necessary to ensure that bigger acts aren’t on stages next to each other. For Donovan, her safety concerns are likely to make this year’s Boston Calling her last. “That’s really sad to say because I’ve gone to the last seven years or something like this now. But it was a little too scary in that crowd. I couldn’t breathe for a minute. We lost Aubrey for a minute. It was nuts,” Donovan said. Baron and Kelly agreed. “The tickets were like $200 and we couldn’t see anything. We could hear the music, but we couldn’t see anything,” Baron said. Kelly, Baron and Donovan weren’t alone. Dozens of comments were left on Boston Calling’s Instagram page, pointing to unsafe conditions. One person wrote “vibes were high until about 4 when the crowds were unbearable and people were passing out left and right from claustrophobia.” Comments compared the festival to Astroworld Festival — a music event in Houston, Texas, in 2021 that was hosted by rapper Travis Scott — where 10 people died from a crowd crush. Some concert-goers claimed comments they made on Boston Calling’s Instagram page complaining about overcrowding were deleted. One person wrote, “Seeing how my previous comments about how unsafe this was are now deleted, I will say it again. There was nothing sweet about being trapped at the red stage and nobody doing anything about it. The artists were amazing but this was organized so poorly. 5 years and I haven’t seen anything like that. I am so disappointed, do better.” Kelly said she saw more comments on Instagram posts last night but this morning there were only a couple dozen. “They don’t want to be blamed. They don’t want to discourage people from going in the future,” Baron said. More boston calling",

        "content": "1 of 1 2 of 1 This Saturday (June 1) is BC Trails Day —and what better way to celebrate than by enjoying the great outdoors? In British Columbia, we’re blessed with many stunning hikes and trails. While amplifying the abundance of the province’s outdoor spaces, the Outdoor Recreation Council of BC also promotes and coordinates events with local communities in conjunction with BC Trails Day. Events include cycling clubs, trail clean-ups, outdoor hangouts, and more. For a complete list of events, see here . Here are a few of our favourite trails, all doable in a day trip from Vancouver. Joffre Lakes Provincial Park At the top of many hiking lists, the trail to Joffre Lakes in Pemberton is a popular choice for a reason. It is considered a more challenging hike, but the reward is a picturesque view of turquoise water nestled among the mountains and forest. Lynn Canyon Loop There’s a lot to take in at Lynn Canyon, like the Suspension Bridge and the Ecology Centre, but this North Vancouver park is also home to one of our favourite trail loops. The hike is famous for bird-watching and is dog-friendly, as long as your four-legged pals stay leashed. Grouse Grind North Vancouver’s famed Grouse Grind is known for being Mother Nature’s Stairmaster. A gruelling 2.5-kilometre trail up the mountain leads you to a gorgeous 360-degree view of Metro Vancouver (and our namesake, the Strait of Georgia). Whistler Train Wreck Trail For a unique viewing experience requiring no stairs and little elevation, the Whistler Train Wreck Trail is an easy trail with high rewards. The short walk offers views of the Cheakamus River before reaching the train wreck site, which features multiple graffitied box cars that date back to the 1950s. Stawamus Chief A choose-your-own-adventure type of hike, the Chief in Squamish is often recommended to tourists because it offers stunning views of the Sea to Sky corridor and has three distinct peaks (some of which involve fun ladders and chains to get to). Afterwards, burgers and beers in downtown Squamish are a must.",

        "description": "One incident took volunteers five hours to tow a vessel back to safety",
        "content": "It's been a busy bank holiday weekend for Exmouth RNLI as crews rescued a lone sailor who had fallen overboard and five people stuck on a vessel which had lost power. The two incidents happened on Saturday, May 25 and Sunday, May 26. Exmouth RNLI’s inshore lifeboat George Bearman II was launched on Saturday within five minutes of being alerted by a Personal Locator Beacon (PLB) to a person who had fallen overboard. It was followed rapidly by the all-weather lifeboat R & J Welburn and five crew members. The Coastguard also broadcast a Mayday alert to all nearby vessels requesting any possible assistance. Both lifeboats made their way to the location, along with a passing private motor vessel. READ NEXT: Child, 5, severely injured at Devon tourist attraction Unexploded WW2 bomb found in Devon garden The motor vessel arrived at the scene first and pulled the casualty from the water. Exmouth RNLI said he was then transferred, via the inshore lifeboat, to the safety to the all-weather lifeboat. Once the crew were happy that the casualty required no further medical attention, they made their way back to his sailing vessel and deployed a crew member onboard to help get it back under control. The casualty skipper then felt he was well enough to re-join his vessel, so accompanied by a crew member and escorted by the lifeboat, made his way back to the River Exe and the boat’s original mooring. Exmouth RNLI volunteer Deputy Coxswain, Roy Stott said: \"It was a great outcome for everyone involved, as when a person is in the water things can very quickly deteriorate with tragic consequence. The casualties' life was almost certainly saved by the combination of his safety equipment including his Personal Locator Beacon and lifejacket. \"It gave us an accurate location of where he was, whilst keeping him afloat until help arrived. Also a sincere thanks to the skipper of the motor vessel that responded and pulled the individual from the water. A real one crew effort and a life saved.\" ⚠️ Want the latest Devon breaking news and top stories first? Click here to join our WhatsApp group.

If you’re curious, you can read our Privacy Notice ⚠️ The following day on Sunday (May 26) at approximately 12:40pm, Exmouth’s all-weather lifeboat was launched to a 17m (55ft) motor vessel that had issued a PanPan call having broken down 26 miles east of Berry Head. Upon arrival, the volunteer crew assessed the situation and established that the vessel’s automatic fire suppression system had triggered, preventing the engine from operating. Given the challenging weather conditions with 3m swells and the vessel not able to use its engine, there was no way for the family onboard (two adults and three children) to return safely to shore. They were also suffering with sea sickness. So, the Coxswain decided that towing to the nearest point of safety was the most appropriate course of action. It was a lengthy 26m trip back to Torquay at a speed of four knots, taking over five hours. Upon arrival, the vessel was safely secured alongside and the crew then made the journey back to Exmouth to refuel and prepare the lifeboat again for service. The very tired volunteers finally left the lifeboat station after a gruelling 11 hours from the first page. A spokesperson for Exmouth RNLI said: \"Some of the volunteer lifeboat crew who responded to the call on Sunday were taking part in a cricket match at the Exmouth Cricket Club Charity Day. There were still enough volunteers to muster a team to play and heavy showers did not deter them, as they’re well used to being out in poor weather conditions. \"All proceeds from the event were being donated to the lifesaving charity. Everyone at Exmouth RNLI thanks Exmouth Cricket Club for arranging the day and to the other cricket teams who joined from Exmouth Cricket Club, Exmouth Rowing Club and Exmouth Rugby Club. It was a family friendly day with live music, bars, food and included free cricket coaching for local children.\"",

        "content": "After suffering his earliest-ever defeat at the French Open, a tournament he has won a record 14 times, Rafael Nadal said it is unlikely for him to play at Wimbledon next month, even as he eyes a chance to turn out at the Olympics, taking place at his beloved Roland Garros later this year, one last time. “I can’t confirm anything, but I don’t think it’s smart (to play Wimbledon) after everything my body has been through,” he was quoted as saying by AFP at his post-match press conference. “It will be difficult playing on grass, considering that right after Wimbledon are the Olympic Games.” Nadal, hoping to be competitive in his first round against an in-form opponent, showed invariable signs of rustiness after playing only 15 matches since the start of 2023. He bowed out 3-6, 6-7(5), 3-6 to in-form fourth seed Alexander Zverev. The Spaniard was competitive, especially in the second set which he served for before slumping in the tie-breaker, but Zverev’s shotmaking, fitness and power proved too much to handle. Advertisement READ | French Open: Clay god Rafael Nadal’s exit starts end of unprecedented Roland Garros stronghold Nadal said his body had been through the wringer in recent times. “My body has been a jungle for two years. It has been a big fight, waking up as if a snake or a tiger had bitten me. I need to prepare myself and clear my ideas about a calendar. My main goal is to prepare for the Olympics and to prepare well to be healthy here,” he said, per tennismajors.com, at the press conference. The soon-to-be-38-year-old said he takes positives from Monday’s loss to the German. “My feeling is that I wasn’t that far. I was at a good level (in the match),” Nadal added. “If it was the last time I played here, I would be at peace with myself. I tried to do everything I could to play here. At least I did. Even if I lost, that’s part of the business... I don’t know what’s going to happen in the next few months.” Nadal also had the unusual experience of being watched by active players, in competition at the French Open this year, who were in attendance at Court Philippe Chatrier to bear witness to his potentially final outing. “Happy that it happens, it means that I have a positive legacy here,” he said.",

        "description": "Emmerdale fans breathed a sigh of relief when Belle Dingle went to psychiatric hospital, but viewers soon turned their concerns to another villager who Tom King could hurt next",
        "content": "fans are convinced they have worked out who Tom King (played by James Chase) will hurt next after his wife returned to her psychiatric hospital. Over the past few months, the show has been tackling the sensitive topic of domestic violence through Belle Dingle’s (Eden Taylor-Draper) marriage to Carl King’s son. The junior vet has tried to exert control over his wife by gaslighting her and keeping an eye on her every day. More recently, Tom took his abuse to a whole new level when he punched her in the stomach after spying on her whilst at work. But this isn’t the first time he has hit Belle after he slapped her when she rejected his proposal last year. Last week, viewers watched the blonde bombshell snap at her husband as she pushed him over in the middle of the village as residents looked on in shock. It was at this point that the Belle called her crisis team for help and moved back into her psychiatric hospital. While Belle receives treatment, her abusive husband has been forced to hold down the fort and keep his distance. But during Monday’s visit (May 27) to the village, viewers learnt that her close friend Lydia will be paying her a visit. It didn’t take long before Tom found out when Lydia paid him a visit and dropped off a box of eggs. Now viewers have turned their concerns to another beloved resident after Lydia admitted how much Belle loves her furry friend, Piper. During the show, Lydia paid a visit to the vet to thank him for checking over her beloved pets. And she didn't come empty handed as she dropped off a box of eggs for him. As she handed over the goods, she greeted Belle's beloved dog with a coo. She gushed: \"Aww hello! Are you missing your mummy? I bet she's missing you too, she hates being away from you.\" It was at this point that Tom looked off into the distance as if he had come up with another evil idea just as Lydia offered to walk the perfect pooch for him. Tom insisted he would walk Piper because it would \"do him good to get some fresh air.\" But it was clear the cruel husband had more sinister plans in place, as the show ended moments after he pulled out a syringe filled with medicine. He told the teeny dog: \"Hold still, this will hurt you more than it will hurt me\" before he added: \"Actually, I'm not sure it will.\" After watching the distressing scenes, fans flooded to X - formerly known as Twitter - to share their fears online. One user penned: \"Tom better not harm a hair on that wee dog's head!!!!\" as another fumed: \"If that p***k takes it out on that dog, then I'm switching off #Emmerdale.\" A third agreed: \"Right, just keep the dog out of it. We know things happen with pets. But ffs, don't do this [angry emoji] #Emmerdale.\" A fourth chimed in with: \"If Tom hurts that dog I'm showing up to the Emmerdale studio tour with a vengeance #emmerdale.\" Viewers will have to stay tuned to find out what will happen to Piper while Belle is away.",

        "content": "An Israeli airstrike triggered a fire that killed 45 people in a tent camp in the Gazan city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders who urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel’s assault. More than half of the dead were women, children, and elderly people, health officials in Hamas-run Gaza said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise from people with severe burns. Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after a strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze. Survivors said families were preparing to sleep when the strike hit the Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood where thousands were sheltering after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago.3 “We were praying...and we were getting our children’s beds ready to sleep. There was nothing unusual, then we heard a very loud noise, and fire erupted around us,” said Umm Mohamed Al-Attar, a Palestinian mother in a red headscarf. “All the children started screaming... The sound was terrifying; we felt like the metal was about to collapse on us, and shrapnel fell into the rooms.” Video footage obtained by the international media outlet, Reuters, showed a fire raging in the darkness and people screaming in panic. A group of young men tried to haul away sheets of corrugated iron and a hose from a single fire truck began to douse the flames. Medics later said an Israeli airstrike on Monday on a house in Rafah had killed seven Palestinians, with several others wounded. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was “outraged” over Israel’s latest attacks. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,” he said on X. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling must be respected. More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s offensive, Gaza’s health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. By daylight, the camp in Rafah was a smoking wreckage of tents, twisted metal and charred belongings. Women wept and men held prayers beside bodies in shrouds. Sitting beside bodies of his relatives, Abed Mohammed Al-Attar said Israel lied when it told residents they would be safe in Rafah’s western areas. His brother, sister-in-law and several other relatives were killed in the blaze. “The army is a liar. There is no security in Gaza. There is no security, not for a child, an elderly man, or a woman. Here he (my brother) is with his wife, they were martyred,” he said. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs based in the West Bank condemned “the heinous massacre.” Egypt also condemned Israel’s “deliberate bombing of the tents of displaced people”, state media reported, describing it as a blatant violation of international law. On Monday, the Israeli military said it was investigating reports of an exchange of fire between Israeli and Egyptian soldiers close to the Rafah border crossing with Gaza. Egypt’s military spokesperson said that shooting near the Rafah crossing led to the killing of one person and authorities were investigating. Israeli tanks stepped up the intensity of bombardments of eastern and central areas of Rafah on Monday, killing at least eight, local health officials said. Two medical workers were killed by a missile fired from a drone as they left the Kuwaiti hospital in Rafah, medics said. In Al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza Strip, an Israeli attack killed three Palestinian police officers, Gaza’s Hamas-run interior ministry said. But it faces global condemnation for failing to spare civilian lives. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also condemned the Israeli attack and Qatar said the Rafah strike could hinder efforts to mediate a ceasefire and hostage exchange.",

        "description": "The IEC says as of Monday afternoon an estimated 201 000 voting station visits of special votes were processed in 22 000 service points.",
        "content": "The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) says over 201 794 voting station visits were processed on the first day of special votes on Monday, 27 May. Special votes started on Monday and will end on Tuesday , 28 May, for qualifying voters. IEC REPORTS GOOD PROGRESS ON THE FIRST DAY OF SPECIAL VOTES The Commission said at 14:00, an estimated 201 794 voting station visits of special votes were processed in 22 626 service points. Over the two days, a total of 624 593 voters will be visited 62 000 officials from the Commission, accompanied by political party agents and observers, where they are available. “The Commission reminds those who qualified for special votes that they will only be visited at the given address once. If the voter is not present at the given address, they will be able to cast their vote at the voting station where they are registered,” the IEC reiterated. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE ON THE BALLOT PAPER? Additionally, the IEC clarified that if a voter has made two transactions, the last will override the first. This is reportedly done to protect the integrity of the elections and prevent voters from voting twice. Notably, those who applied to cast a special vote at their voting station must do so between 9:00 and 17:00, which is different from the voting hours of 7:00 to 21:00 on Election Day. The Commission said that after casting votes, the ballots must be inserted in an unmarked envelope, which will then be inserted in a second envelope with the voter’s details. “The special voting process is subject to all the security and integrity protocols of regular voting, including scrutiny by party agents and observers where present. Special votes will be reconciled against the voters’ roll and the list of approved special votes. “Additional checks include the double envelope system, which allows us to still preserve the secrecy of the voter’s ballot. All special votes collected are stored securely overnight on 27 and 28 May. They will be transported to voting stations on 29 May, where they will be opened, reconciled, and added to the ordinary ballots cast on 29 May before counting begins. As 29 May draws near, the Commission also warned South Africans to beware of misinformation and phishing scams on social media and other digital platforms.",

        "content": "When Balu Natarajan became the first Indian American champion of the Scripps National Spelling Bee in 1985, a headline on an Associated Press article read, “Immigrants’ son wins National Spelling Bee,” with the first paragraph noting the champion “speaks his parents’ native Indian language at home.” Those details would hardly be newsworthy today after a quarter-century of Indian American spelling champs, most of them the offspring of parents who arrived in the United States on student or work visas. This year’s bee is scheduled to begin Tuesday at a convention center outside Washington and, as usual, many of the expected contenders are Indian American, including Shradha Rachamreddy, Aryan Khedkar, Bruhat Soma and Ishika Varipilli. Nearly 70% of Indian-born US residents arrived after 2000, according to census data, and that dovetails with the surge in Indian American spelling bee champions. There were two Indian American Scripps winners before 1999. Of the 34 since, 28 have been Indian American, including three straight years of Indian American co-champions and one year (2019) when eight champions were declared, seven of Indian ancestry. The experiences of first-generation Indian Americans and their spelling bee champion children illustrate the economic success and cultural impact of the nation’s second-largest immigrant group. As of 2022, there were 3.1 million Indian-born people living in the US, and Indian American households had a median income of $147,000, more than twice the median income of all US households, according to census data. Indian Americans also were more than twice as likely to have college degrees. Indians received 74% of the H-1B visas for specialised occupations approved in fiscal 2021, and a record total of nearly 269,000 students from India were enrolled at US colleges and universities in 2022-23, according to the Institute of International Education. Those numbers paint a picture of a high-achieving demographic that is well-suited for success in academic competitions. Ganesh Dasari, whose daughter and son each made multiple appearances at the Scripps bee, holds a doctorate in civil engineering from the University of Cambridge and was recruited to the US to work for ExxonMobil on an H-1B visa. He quickly obtained a green card. “Me and my wife, we came from a similar background. We both benefited from having the education ... so we put a lot of emphasis on educating our kids,” Dasari said. “We basically introduced them to anything academic, and a couple of sports, but clearly there was a bias in our thinking that education is a higher priority than sports.” In his 2016 address to Congress, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned “spelling bee champions” among his country’s contributions to the US while that year’s co-champs, Nihar Janga and Jairam Hathwar, watched from the gallery. Even among Indian American spellers, a particular subgroup is overrepresented: families from the southern states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, where Telugu is the primary language. Hyderabad, the capital of Telangana, is India’s information-technology hub and the region supplies many H-1B visa recipients. “Whenever we go to the spelling bee events, everybody speaks that language,” Dasari said. “We realised there are so many people from the same state.” Deval Shah, the father of last year’s champion, Dev Shah, grew up in the northwestern state of Gujarat and proudly noted Dev was the first spelling bee champion of Gujarati descent. The parents of the 2022 winner, Harini Logan, are from Chennai in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Shah is an engineer, his wife is a physician, and both of Harini’s parents were trained as software engineers. Indian-born parents of kids with an affinity for spelling have a network of similar families to provide guidance and support, as well as access to organisations like the North South Foundation, which offers academic competitions aimed at the Indian diaspora. “The reason Indian American immigrants really dominate, the main reason is the North South Foundation,” Shah said. When Harini won her first NSF spelling competition, Ganesh Dasari was one of the judges, and “he was literally chasing us down” to tell them “Harini has tremendous potential to be on the national stage,” said Rampriya Logan, Harini’s mother. Ishika, a 13-year-old from Spring, Texas, who will be competing at Scripps this year for the third time, woke her parents at 6 am the day after she lost a third-grade classroom spelling bee, saying she wanted to participate in more bees. Her mother, an IT manager who immigrated to the US in 2006, then reached out to ask advice from other families from the Houston area whose children were high-level spellers. The relative wealth and stability of Indian American households could lead observers to conclude their children are benefiting primarily from a privileged upbringing. The truth is more nuanced, said Devesh Kapur, a professor of South Asian Studies at Johns Hopkins University and a co-author of The Other One Percent: Indians in America. “It is important to note that the children participating in the spelling bee competition come from striving middle-class immigrant families, often in occupations like IT, and not from wealthier Indian American households in finance or tech start-ups or consulting,” Kapur said. Natarajan, a Chicago-based physician and health care executive, now serves as the volunteer president of the NSF, and he experienced the spelling bee as a parent when his son, Atman Balakrishnan, competed. He said he sometimes feels out of place because he was born in the US and he admires the grit of Indian-born parents and their children. “It’s hard to describe, but it’s a very specific mindset that just drives effort and in many ways drives outcomes and sustainable success,” Natarajan said.",

        "content": "The National Information Technology Development Agency has vowed to implement its Strategic Roadmap and Action Plan 2.0, to transform Nigeria into a digital innovation powerhouse. The agency said on its X platform on Sunday that it held a 2-day retreat for top management staff to facilitate the implementation of the strategic roadmap. It noted that the primary objective of the retreat was to digitally empower Nigeria and promote inclusive economic growth, aligning with President Bola Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda. The Director General of NTDA, Kashifu Inuwa, and top and middle management staff were in attendance, brainstorming innovative ideas to drive the country’s digital transformation. “This endeavour aligns with the agency’s overarching mission to spearhead Nigeria’s digital transformation agenda, which is closely tied to the eight priority areas outlined in President Bola Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda,” part of the statement read. According to the agency, its efforts are expected to have a positive impact on the country’s digital landscape, promoting economic growth and empowerment for all Nigerians. The NITDA Strategic Roadmap and Action Plan (SRAP 2021–2024) is a comprehensive strategy developed on seven key elements to drive digital transformation and innovation within the country. It focused on areas such as digitisation, capacity building, and the promotion of a digital economy. The SRAP 2021–2024 was designed to align with the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy for a Digital Nigeria, which includes pillars like developmental regulation, solid infrastructure, digital literacy, and the promotion of indigenous content. According to the NTDA, one of the primary goals of the plan is to achieve 95 per cent digital literacy by 2030 and to build the capacity of one million technology developers over the next eighteen months.",

        "content": "High-income earners have a 32% lower risk of dying after a stroke compared to low-income earners. The equivalent for high education is 26% lower risk. The differences in stroke survival linked to socioeconomics are striking, according to a study at the University of Gothenburg. The results will be presented on Wednesday at the European Stroke Conference ESOC 2024 in Basel, Switzerland. Katharina Stibrant Sunnerhagen, Professor of Rehabilitation Medicine at the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, and the lead researcher behind the study, will be present. The register-based study analyzed data from 6,901 stroke patients at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg. The aim was to investigate the influence of what are called social determinants of health on stroke survival. Four factors were in focus: place of residence, country of birth, education and income. Disadvantageous factors included living in an area classified by the authorities as a vulnerable area, risk area or particularly vulnerable area, being born outside Sweden or Europe, having a short education and low income. In addition to the association between income, education and stroke survival, the study shows a worrying trend in the combined effect of various factors. With one disadvantageous factor, the risk of death after a stroke was 18% higher, and with two to four disadvantageous factors it was 24% higher, compared with no disadvantageous factors. \"This shows the reality that an individual's socio-economic situation can be a matter of life and death within the context of stroke, especially when several disadvantageous factors come into play,\" says Sunnerhagen. The study also found an association between increased risk of death after stroke and additional risk factors such as physical inactivity, diabetes, alcohol abuse and atrial fibrillation. Clear gender differences also emerged when the characteristics of patients were studied. Among those with no disadvantageous social determinants of health, 41% were women, while women made up 59% of the group with two to four disadvantageous factors. In the latter group, smokers and former smokers were also overrepresented. \"The number of people suffering from stroke in Europe is expected to increase, making the need for effective interventions more important than ever. Targeted strategies are crucial, policy makers need to tailor legislation and consider specific circumstances and needs in different parts of society, while health care providers should consider identifying patients at higher risk of fatality from stroke,\" says Sunnerhagen. \"By addressing disparities, we will not only support the principles of health equity, but also have the opportunity to significantly improve overall public health,\" she concludes.

        "content": "Lots of people have started taking weight loss drugs like over the last two years. But fewer have asked a key question: What happens if they need to stop taking the medications? It's a situation many people are facing. Sometimes, patients have to stop taking the drugs because they get pregnant or are preparing for surgery, on Monday. In other cases, the drugs have become hard to find. One patient who used Zepbound, another GLP-1 drug, to lose 35 pounds told NPR that he had to start using a rival drug after he couldn't find more Zepbound. \"There are going to be scenarios, especially in young people, [where] we will have to come off the medicine, whether they like it or not,\" Dr. Rekha Kumar, an endocrinologist who formerly served as medical director of the American Board of Obesity Medicine, told NPR. like Ozempic and Wegovy have been touted as quick ways to lose weight and avoid health problems associated with obesity, such as heart problems. The medications rely on Semaglutide, an active ingredient that reduces users' appetites. Some have even said that widespread use of the drugs could lead to , as poor health imposes significant economic costs. But many people who have started using these medicines aren't obese and turned to them for their short-term effects. If patients stop taking the medicine, they will likely gain back much of the weight that they lost, especially without careful changes to their diet and exercise, NPR reported. One study released earlier this month suggested that Ozempic and Wegovy users could minimize that weight gain by gradually weaning themselves off of the drugs instead of quitting suddenly. But the single study used a small sample size, indicating that more research is needed to confirm the approach, . Besides drugmakers like Novo Nordisk, which makes Ozempic and Wegovy, food company Nestlé has also gotten in on the weight loss frenzy. The company said last week, that , a new frozen food brand from Nestlé, will offer small-portioned meals designed for GLP-1 users starting later this year. Read the original article on",

        "content": "Toronto FC fullback/wingback Richie Laryea, sidelined by a hamstring injury since the Feb. 25 season opener, is expected to return to action Saturday at D.C. United. Coach John Herdman said Laryea will travel with the MLS team for Wednesday’s game in Philadelphia but won’t take the field until Saturday. With two away games this week, Toronto plans to stay south of the border after the mid-week game. Laryea, one of Toronto’s designated players along with Italian stars Lorenzo Insigne and Federico Bernardeschi, underwent surgery March 23 in London, England. At the time, his recovery time was said to be three months. Herdman said Laryea won’t be on the active roster for the Philadelphia game. “The expectation is Richie will play minutes against D.C. United,” Herdman said after training Monday. “That’s been the plan, so this week he’s ramping up. He’ll hit all his sort of final check boxes and put a real intense training week in but will travel with the team so he’s ready to go against D.C.” The 29-year-old Laryea and TFC captain Jonathan Osorio were included Monday in Jesse Marsch’s first roster selection as Canada coach for friendlies June 6 and 9 against the Netherlands and France. “I’m proud for those lads,” said Herdman, who stepped down in August as Canada coach to take over Toronto. “I know what it means to them to represent their country. “Richie’s had a tough run so I’m pleased Jesse put the trust in him, because he’s a guy who loves playing for Canada. He gives his everything and I’ve seen him reach special levels in that Canadian jersey. While he plays in MLS, when he plays for Canada he’s able to show he’s got world-class ability. And I’d say the same for Osorio.” While Toronto does not have any games scheduled while Laryea and Osorio are away for the friendlies, Herdman will feel the pain during Copa America, which runs June 20 to July 24. “(Copa America) comes at time for us in June where you’d love to have had that full squad available,” he said. “But having been the guy that took players away from MLS clubs and not worry too much about it, being on the other end you’ve just got to pat these boys on the back and wish them all the best.” Laryea, who has 48 caps, last played for Canada in November’s CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinal series against Jamaica. Osorio has 71 caps. Rookie wingback Tyrese Spicer, who came off in the 58th minute of Saturday’s 4-3 loss to visiting FC Cincinnati, is questionable for Wednesday’s game with a gastrointestinal issue. “We’re just learning whether it’s muscular or something different,” Herdman said. Forward Prince Owusu is being monitored for a tight calf. Midfielder Brandon Servania (knee) and defender Shane O’Neil (thigh) remain on the injured list. Bernardeschi returns this week after missing the Cincinnati game due to yellow card accumulation. Toronto (7-7-1) goes into mid-week play in sixth place in the Eastern Conference, two places and four points ahead of Philadelphia (4-4-6). TFC has won just one of its last four league matches (1-0-3). But it has won seven of its last 10 (7-3-0) in all competitions.",

        "content": "A series of powerful storms swept over the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, killing at least 21 people and leaving a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive, early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, said at a Monday press conference that four people had died in four different counties. The death toll of 21 also included seven deaths in Cooke County, Texas, from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas. Two people died in Mayes County, Oklahoma, which is east of Tulsa, authorities said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. The latest community left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny Kentucky community of Charleston, which took a direct hit Sunday night from a tornado that the governor said appeared to be on the ground for 40 miles (64 kilometers). “It’s a big mess,” said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs, hit by a tornado in 2021. “Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever – no water, no power.” Further east, some rural areas of Hopkins County hit by the 2021 tornado around the community of Barnsley were damaged again Sunday night, said county Emergency Management Director Nick Bailey. “There were a lot of people that were just getting their lives put back together and then this,” Bailey said. “Almost the same spot, the same houses and everything.\" Beshear has traveled to the area where his father grew up several times for ceremonies where people who lost everything were given the keys to their new homes. The visits came after a series of tornadoes on a terrifying night in December 2021 killed 81 people in Kentucky. “It could have been much worse,” Beshear said of the Memorial Day weekend storms. “The people of Kentucky are very weather aware with everything we’ve been through.” More than 500,000 customers across the eastern U.S. were without power Monday afternoon, including about 170,000 in Kentucky. Twelve states reported at least 10,000 outages, according to PowerOutage.us . The area on highest alert for severe weather Monday is a broad swath of the eastern U.S., from Alabama to New York. President Joe Biden sent condolences to the families who had people killed. He said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is on the ground conducting damage assessments and he has contacted governors to see what federal support they might need.. It's been a grim month of tornadoes and severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. Storms killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. The severe thunderstorms and deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. That warm moist air is at the northern edge of a heat dome bringing temperatures typically seen at the height of summer to late May. The heat index — a combination of air temperature and humidity to indicate how the heat feels to the human body — is expected to reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in parts of south Texas on Monday. Record highs are forecast for Brownsville, San Antonio and Dallas. Miami set a record high of 96 F (35.5 C) on Sunday.

The visits came after a series of tornadoes on a terrifying night in December 2021 killed 81 people in Kentucky. “It could have been much worse,” Beshear said of the Memorial Day weekend storms. “The people of Kentucky are very weather aware with everything we’ve been through.” More than 500,000 customers across the eastern U.S. were without power Monday afternoon, including about 170,000 in Kentucky. Twelve states reported at least 10,000 outages, according to PowerOutage.us . The area on highest alert for severe weather Monday is a broad swath of the eastern U.S., from Alabama to New York. President Joe Biden sent condolences to the families who had people killed. He said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is on the ground conducting damage assessments and he has contacted governors to see what federal support they might need.. It's been a grim month of tornadoes and severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. Storms killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. The severe thunderstorms and deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. That warm moist air is at the northern edge of a heat dome bringing temperatures typically seen at the height of summer to late May. The heat index — a combination of air temperature and humidity to indicate how the heat feels to the human body — is expected to reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in parts of south Texas on Monday. Record highs are forecast for Brownsville, San Antonio and Dallas. Miami set a record high of 96 F (35.5 C) on Sunday.

The caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive, early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, said at a Monday press conference that four people had died in four different counties. The death toll of 21 also included seven deaths in from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas. Two people died in Mayes County, Oklahoma, which is east of Tulsa, authorities said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. The latest community left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny Kentucky community of Charleston, which took a direct hit Sunday night from a tornado that the governor said appeared to be on the ground for 40 miles (64 kilometers). “It’s a big mess,” said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs, hit by a tornado in 2021. “Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down.

As the daughter of one of Hollywood's most famous former couples , Shiloh has lived much of her life in the spotlight, but her longtime choreographer has now spoken out to insist that the budding dancer could not be further from the stereotypical Hollywood ' nepo baby .' Shiloh, or 'Shi' to her friends and family, first wowed the world with her dance skills in 2021, when a video of her performing went viral. Now three years later - as the teenager celebrates her milestone birthday - her choreographer, Keelan Carter, has now revealed an exclusive glimpse into her life inside the dance studio. Despite boasting famous parents, dance pro Keelan tells DailyMail.com that Shiloh is determined to achieve her goals without relying on her famous name. 'Shiloh is an exceptionally talented dancer, demonstrating dedication and hard work,' the accomplished choreographer, actor and fashion designer continued. 'She is a sincere and straightforward person who never uses her celebrity status to her advantage.' Shiloh Jolie-Pitt turned 18 years old today and has become an 'exceptionally talented dancer,' her choreographer Keelan Carter (pictured together dancing) told DailyMail.com Shiloh (seen with mom Angelina Jolie, 48, on a red carpet in 2021) 'does not rely on her famous last name to achieve her goals,' Keelan - who goes by Lil Keelan Carter - said Read More Angelina Jolie is ordered to turn over every NDA she signed with a third party from 2014 to 2022 after she claimed she walked out of Miraval sale due to Brad Pitt's 'cruel' gag order 'Shi does not rely on her famous name to achieve her goals. Honestly, I didn't even know who she was at first and I don't think this matters, especially in a dance studio. 'I understand that it can be difficult to see the person beyond her celebrity status, but I urge you to make an effort for her. Believe me, it is worth it.' Keelan told DailyMail.com that his recent dance videos featuring Shiloh 'were made in the same way I post any dancer who comes to my sessions or classes and whom I believe deserves to be featured.' In a video shared to his Instagram account on Wednesday featuring Shiloh and three other dancers, Keelan wrote: 'Can't wait to be back in the studio with these talented people. 'In the last period of my life, LA feels like home and I'm glad that I had the opportunity to meet so many hardworking and wonderful people. I'm glad every time to have you next to me in the studio, so thank you guys.' In the clip, the four danced to the song Tanzania by Uncle Waffles and Tony Duardo featuring Sino Msolo and Boibizza. The routine was choreographed by Keelan. Shiloh wore sweats and an oversized tee as she showcased her swift moves with Keelan writing: 'Her movement is crazy. Thank you for your energy.' Keelan has posted numerous videos featuring Shiloh, as have several of her other dance class colleagues, but the famous daughter is rarely tagged in any of the videos, as they all respect her privacy, DailyMail.com was told. Although Angelina - who worked with the the UN Refugee Agency for more than two decades, visiting camps in Cambodia, Tanzania, Sierra Leone, and Pakistan with all of her kids in tow at times - has not commented specifically on Shiloh's dance, she has spoken out about fostering the unique talents of all of her children. Keelan - an accomplished choreographer, dancer, actor, and fashion designer - has shared several video of Shiloh on his social media pages Keelan (on the left dancing to a routine he choreographed) said, 'Honestly, I didn't even know who she was at first and I don't think this matters, especially in a dance studio' In a clip on Keelan's Instagram, Shiloh danced to the song Tanzania by Uncle Waffles and Tony Duardo featuring Sino Msolo and Boibizza 'I understand that it can be difficult to see the person beyond her celebrity status, but I urge you to make an effort for her,' Keelan said of Shiloh (showing off her moves in a recent clip) 'Children should be allowed to express themselves in whatever way they wish without anybody judging them because it is an important part of their growth,' she once said in an interview with Reuters . Shiloh's dad Brad gushed about his daughter's dance ability in a 2022 i nterview with Entertainment Tonight . While promoting his film Bullet Train, he called Shiloh 'very beautiful' and said that her talent 'brings a tear the eye.' 'I don't know where she got it from. I'm Mr. Two-Left-Feet here,' Brad, now 60, told ET at time. Shiloh's parents tied the knot in August 2014 during a secret ceremony in the south of France, and welcomed three children together during their romance - Shiloh in 2006, and twins Vivienne and Knox, now 15, in 2008. They also adopted two more kids - Zahara, now 18, and Pax, now 20 - and Brad also legally adopted son Maddox, now 22, who became part of Angelina's brood before they got together. But in 2016, it came to an explosive end after the pair got into an alleged physical altercation while on a private flight with their six kids. In 2022, Shiloh showed off her skills while dancing to Doja Cat's song Vegas in a video with her instructor, Hamilton Evans (seen here) 'Shiloh loves dancing. She's seriously talented and has been going to these classes for a few years now,' a source told Us Weekly about Shiloh (seen at Millennium Dance complex) Angelina claimed that Brad 'choked' one of the children during the horrifying dispute and 'struck' another in the face, leaving her and the kids feeling like 'hostages.' Brad's rep called Angelina's account 'completely untrue' to CNN at first, but then released an amended statement to the publication that read: 'Angelina's story continues to evolve each time she tells it. 'Brad has accepted responsibility for what he did but will not for things he didn't do. He has been on the receiving end of every type of personal attack and misrepresentation. 'Thankfully, the various public authorities she has tried to use against him over the past six years have made their own independent decisions. Brad will continue to respond in court as he has consistently done.' Despite all six kids growing up as Hollywood royalty, the Jolie-Pitt brood are all very unique. In a 2010 interview with Vanity Fair , Angelina said, 'Mad's a real intellectual, which I can take no credit for genetically. He's great at school, great at history. He feels like he could be a writer or travel the world and learn about places and things. 'Zahara's got an extraordinary voice and is just so elegant and well spoken. Shiloh's hysterically funny, one of the goofiest, most playful people you'll ever meet.' 'Knox and Viv are classic boy and girl. She's really female. And he's really a little dude,' the actress added. She continued: 'Shiloh dresses like a little dude. She likes to dress like a boy. She wants to be a boy. So we had to cut her hair. She likes to wear boys' everything. She thinks she's one of the brothers.' The past several years have been incredibly transformative for Shiloh. In 2021, Shiloh ditched the tomboy look when she walked the red carpet with her mom and siblings for several international premieres of Angelina's Eternals film. Looking glamorous and donning designer dresses, Shiloh set the internet ablaze at the premieres in London, Rome and Los Angeles. Since then, Shiloh has opted for a constant casual look - often being spotted in hoodies and sweatpants. She has been photographed numerous times arriving to - and leaving - dance lessons. She has since cut her hair short into a short pixie cut. Shiloh's parents Brad and Angelina married in August 2014 after 10 years together, but Angelina filed for divorce in September 2016 (seen in 2006) Shiloh (second right) is pictured in 2021 with mom Angelina and siblings Maddox, Vivienne, Knox and Zahara. She he also has older brother, Pax, who did not attend the event In a 2022 interview with Entertainment Tonight, Brad (seen with his family two years before divorce) gushed about Shiloh's dancing skills and added: 'I don't know where she got it from' Shiloh's dance talent has been recognized since 2021 when a video of her dancing to Vegas by Rihanna was shared on YouTube by LA-based choreographer Hamilton Evans. She took center stage at Millennium Dance Complex in Studio City to perform an energetic one-minute routine while flanked by two other girls. Another video saw Shiloh busting her best moves to Lizzo's About Damn Time, while the rest of her dance troupe watched on from behind. 'Shiloh loves dancing. She's seriously talented and has been going to these classes for a few years now,' an insider told Us Weekly at the time. 'She's made some good friends through the dancing community too, and they're all in chat groups and share their favorite playlists and that type of stuff. 'The teachers are all very impressed with her and say the sky's the limit if she wants to take it to the next level, and Shiloh may just do that.' The source added: 'Brad and Angie are both very proud. They'd have no issue if she wants to turn pro, but they're not pushing it on her by any means.' Shiloh first made her acting debut in her father's 2008 hit film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. In 2016, the talented teen lent her voice to the character Shuai Shuai in Kung Fu Panda 3. Last week DailyMail.com revealed, Shiloh's mom Angelina was hit with another legal blow in her bitter battle with Brad over their Chateau Miraval estate. The Tomb Raider actress, 48, was ordered by a judge in LA Superior Court to produce every NDA agreement that she signed with a third-party over an eight-year period from 2014 - the year they married - to 2022. Documents detailing the judge's decision were made public as part of the ongoing 'War of the Roses,' with the A-list couple stuck in an acrimonious battle over her rights to sell their French vineyard and home.

        "description": "Greene's birthday message divided some social media users on Monday.",
        "content": "Representative 's birthday post went viral on social media Monday. Greene, a Georgia whose support for staunchly right-wing policies propelled her to national prominence, celebrated her 50th birthday with a post to X, formerly . She wrote that while many people think turning 50 is \"a bad thing,\" she feels \"it's wonderful and I'm so excited and grateful God let me live 50 years and do so many things.\" \"From being the first person to graduate college in my family, to carrying 3 babies in my womb and the absolute miracle of 3 childbirths, to raising my children and teaching them about God's creation and man's dangers, to running successful businesses and carrying the weight of the responsibility, being a member of congress, running, cycling, swimming, competing, training, reading, always learning, creating, building, skiing, surfing, hiking, making mistakes, learning lessons, and most importantly God's grace that I don't deserve but am thankful for beyond words, my 50 years have been an incredible journey that I'm thrilled to be on,\" Greene wrote. The post went viral on X, being viewed more than 20,000 times, reposted 688 times and received more than 3,000 comments in two hours. Some high-profile , like Arizona candidate , responded to the post by wishing Greene a happy birthday. Former President 's ex-lawyer Jenna Ellis also wished her a happy birthday and wrote, \"Age is a gift from the Lord.\" Others, however, were more critical. Public relations consultant Eric Rosen wrote, \"A Memorial Day message from MTG. 'Me, me, me, me....'\" Greene posted a Memorial Day message to her official congressional X account earlier on Monday: Today, we honor those who paid the ultimate price for our liberty. Their sacrifice is the foundation of our freedom. #MemorialDay\" Other critics referred to a quote from a spat between in the comments of the post. reached out to Greene's office for comment via email. Earlier this month, a House Oversight Committee hearing descended into chaos after Greene made a remark about the Texas Republican's appearance. After Greene refused to apologize, Crockett asked, \"I'm just curious. To better understand your ruling, if someone on this committee then starts talking about somebody's bleached blonde, bad-built, butch body, that would not be engaging in personalities, correct?\" The post comes just days after Georgia's congressional primaries. Greene ran unopposed in the Republican primary and officially secured renomination in Georgia's 14th Congressional District, which contains some areas near Atlanta as well as the conservative rural northwestern part of the state. The Democratic primary for the seat is set to go to a June 18 runoff, though the seat is not expected to be competitive in November. In 2022, Greene won reelection with 66 percent of the vote. Since being elected in 2020, Greene has turned into a national figure, supported by many conservative voters for her support for former President Donald Trump and positions on issues like immigration and the Russia-Ukraine war. She has also become a lightning rod for Democratic criticism over her previous support for conspiracy theories, , and right-wing policy positions. She has recently faced backlash over her failed attempt at ousting House Speaker for passing Ukraine aid.

        "description": "A sore arm has detoured Austin Gomber's career-best roll.",
        "content": "A sore arm has detoured a career run for Austin Gomber. The Rockies’ left-hander was scratched from his Monday afternoon start against Cleveland at Coors Field. Right-hander Anthony Molina, a Rule-5 draft pickup, was called on to fill in for Gomber. The preliminary plan calls for Gomber to skip Monday’s start and pitch this weekend against the Dodgers in Los Angeles. “I felt really good after my last start in Oakland, but then we flew back here and there was a little bit of swelling and inflammation near the back of my triceps where it meets the elbow,” said Gomber, adding that his arm was at about 85%. “I skipped my bullpen, but then I felt better yesterday and much better today. “I pitched through worse things last year, but we felt like with our schedule, we had the ability to skip (a start) and buy me a couple of extra days.” In 10 starts, Gomber is 1-2 with a 2.76 ERA, the fifth-lowest ERA by a Rockies starting pitcher through their first 10 starts of a season in franchise history. In four starts in May, he has a 0.68 ERA, the fourth-lowest in the majors this month. “We thought it was best to push Austin back,” manager Bud Black said. “His arm didn’t quite recover from his last start. It’s still a bit sore. This is a precautionary push-back.” Struggling right-handed reliever Justin Lawrence was placed on the 15-day injured list with what Black called “general arm soreness.” While Lawrence does have fatigue and soreness, the IL stint will also enable Lawrence to work on his mechanics. “We will get him back on the horse with some drills that we feel will help him mechanically,” Black said. “We will get to him on the mound in about three or four days.” Lawrence began the season as Colorado’s closer, but he’s been erratic and involved in several of the Rockies’ late-inning meltdowns. The right-hander is 1-3 with a 5.91 ERA over 20 appearances (21 1/3 innings) with 20 strikeouts and 15 walks. In other bullpen moves, Colorado recalled right-hander Peter Lambert from Triple-A Albuquerque, selected the contract of left-handed reliever Josh Rogers and designated John Curtiss for assignment. Rookie outfielder Jordan Beck is scheduled to undergo surgery on his left hand Wednesday. Dr. Donald Sheridan, a hand specialist based in Scottsdale, Ariz., will insert a plate into Beck’s hand. in his left hand in the Rockies’ 8-4 loss to the Phillies on Saturday night at Coors Field. Beck, 23, jammed his left (glove) hand while making a diving catch on Nick Castellano’s sinking line drive in left field in the first inning. “From what I’ve heard medically, this is a good thing because it speeds up the (healing) process,” Black said regarding Beck’s surgery. Black added that the Rockies hope to have Beck back in four to six weeks.",

        "description": "Leeds United now know who they will be facing next season and some familiar faces have returned to the Championship.",
        "content": "Leeds United will be in the Championship again next season and whether another 46-game promotion push is to be enjoyed or endured depends on your outlook. Sunday’s 1-0 play-off final defeat against Southampton saw Leeds unable to seriously threaten, with substitute Dan James seeing a late effort crash off the bar in the only moment of hope on an otherwise flat day. Daniel Farke ’s side now have to go again from August with the pressure of promotion ramped up amid reduced parachute payments, and the likely need to sell top players presents an obvious downside to another year of Championship football . But the more optimistic might see next season as a chance to build and if United can rack up 90 points again, a top-two finish would almost certainly be secured and the campaign will be one of joy, rather than heartbreak. Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with a Digital Subscription to Yorkshire Evening Post, you can get unlimited access to the website including our premium content, as well as benefiting from fewer ads, loyalty rewards and much more. Leeds fans live for the biggest occasions and another year in the second-tier will set up plenty of massive games, particularly after learning who will be re-entering the league after Premier League relegation or League One promotion. It means Elland Road will play host to the rekindling of some old rivalries and the YEP has highlighted a few to look forward to. A woeful campaign for just about everyone in Yorkshire was perhaps most keenly felt at Bramall Lane , with Sheffield United instantly relegated after spending much of the season propping up the Premier League table. 16 points saw them finish with half the total needed to survive and the concession of 104 goals in 38 games was a league record. Chris Wilder replaced Paul Heckingbottom in December and is expected to lead a charge for promotion next season, hoping for a repeat of the 2018/19 campaign in which they pipped Marcelo Bielsa ’s Leeds to a top-two finish. It was after securing automatic promotion that a loose-lipped Wilder labelled the likes of Patrick Bamford and Adam Forshaw ‘muppets’. The Blades and Leeds have rarely met since then and were only in the same league during the 2020/21 Premier League campaign in which Bielsa twice came out the victor. Wilder’s comments have not been forgotten by those in West Yorkshire and his return to Elland Road is unlikely to be a warm welcome. Advertisement Advertisement The Rams were another team to strike up tensions during Marcelo Bielsa’s first season at Elland Road following the famous ‘Spygate’ saga in which a Leeds staff member was spotted outside Derby’s training ground. Derby would have the last laugh that season after knocking Leeds out of the play-offs but a Championship title the following year saw bragging rights back in West Yorkshire. Get a personalised Leeds United news round-up when you sign up for our free Leeds United newsletter email. After a mountain of financial issues, points deductions and off-pitch chaos, Derby were relegated the following season while Leeds finished ninth in the Premier League. But after stabilising, the Rams finished second in League One this season and will return to Elland Road as Championship rivals. Few who last faced Leeds remain at Derby going into next season but the sour feeling among supporters is still very much there, with both sides desperate to get one over on a rival. Farke’s side will undoubtedly be favourites both home and away. Advertisement Advertisement One of the few Derby players who gave Leeds a guard of honour back in 2020 was Wayne Rooney and the former striker will come up against the Whites again - only this time as manager of Plymouth Argyle. Rooney’s arrival at Home Park was confirmed last week and he will hope to improve on a dismal spell at Birmingham City. It was Leeds who put the final nail in the coffin for Rooney at Birmingham, with a comfortable 3-0 win in January the final defeat before he was sacked, having overseen a drop from play-off hopefuls to relegation candidates - they eventually went down to League One. Rooney will hope to last longer than 15 games at Plymouth and should he remain in charge for the trip to Elland Road, he can expect a special welcome from the 36,000-plus inside.",

        "content": "Bhadrak : A day ahead of Amit Shah’s visit to Chandbali Constituency, BJP’s Ganjam district president Dr Subash Chandra Sahu and five of his supports were allegedly attacked by a group of BJD activists on Monday. As per reports, Subash Chandra Sahu, BJP’s in-charge for the Chandbali assembly segment, suffered a fracture on his left hand and one of his supporters, Devdatta Maharaj, also sustained injuries in the unprecedented attack. Both were admitted to the hospital. As Union Minister Amit Shah is scheduled to address an election rally in Chandbali constituency to canvas for Odisha state unit president Manmohan Samal on Tuesday, Sahu and his supporters were travelling in an SUV to take stock of the party’s preparations in Chandbali assembly. However, some BJD activists allegedly waylaid the vehicle, bearing the BJP’s flag, near Ghanteswar Totapada Chhak on the Bhadrak-Chandbali road and attacked the saffron party workers. They also vandalised the car. Tension prevailed at the scene for some time. Then, the police arrived and prevented the situation from escalating further. Reportedly, the injured BJP leader has lodged a written complaint at Ghanteswar police outpost.",

        "content": "Israeli and Egyptian forces have exchanged fire near Rafah amid growing tensions between the two sides over the Tel Aviv regime’s onslaught on the Gaza Strip. Citing military sources, Israeli media said Egyptian troops fired at Israeli soldiers who returned fire. An Egyptian soldier was killed in the exchange of fire. The Egyptian Armed Forces said they are conducting an investigation into the shooting. Daily News Egypt, an independent English-language Egyptian newspaper, cited unnamed sources as saying Egyptian soldiers were \"affected\" by the Rafah massacre on Sunday. Israeli forces seized the Rafah border crossing earlier this month as they launched an offensive in Rafah. The occupation of the crossing has increased tensions between Egypt and Israel, threatening a peace treaty between the two sides, which had previously fought four wars.",

        "content": "The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) minister, Barrister Nyesom Wike, took a final lap of inspection of the facilities of the Abuja light rail project on Monday evening, preparatory to President Tinubu’s flag-off of commercial activities to mark his one year in office. It would be recalled that Wike, in an earlier inspection of the rail project, observed some minor things he said needed to be corrected. Speaking after the inspection, Wike said, “We are good to go; for the president, it’s a promise made and a promise kept. First of all, we are very happy that all our efforts have come to fruition. It’s no longer a story, but a reality.” However, he protested that he shouldn’t rate himself when asked about Tinubu’s performance in one year. He said one year is too short for any meaningful contribution, but he narrated the achievements so far. “So you are asking me to rate myself, however, if you say so. You can see that Mr President has done very well, not only in physical infrastructure but also in human capital development. “Nothing in this world is better than a career prospect. I am sure the civil servants in the FCT are very happy that their hopes have been rekindled. Their hopes have been restored. “Mr President has done very well. He is reassuring Nigerians that he is committed to delivering the dividends of democracy. “There are so many areas of attention; one year is really not enough for you to expect 100 per cent, but what you’ve seen on the ground shows there is hope for Nigerians.” With the dressed rehearsal on Monday, all is set and prepared for Mr President to take a ride on the Abuja light rail billed for Wednesday.

        "content": "Taipei, May 27 (AP) A US congressional delegation met Taiwan’s new leader on Monday in a show of support days after China held drills around the self-governing island in response to his inauguration. Rep. Andy Barr, the co-chair of the Taiwan caucus in the US Congress, said the United States is fully committed to supporting Taiwan militarily, diplomatically and economically. “There should be no doubt, there should be no scepticism in the United States, Taiwan or anywhere in the world, of American resolve to maintain the status quo and peace in the Taiwan Strait,” the Republican from Kentucky said at a news conference in the capital, Taipei, after the delegation met Taiwan President Lai Ching-te. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province that must come under its control, by force if necessary. The US, like most countries, does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is bound by its own laws to provide the island with the means to defend itself. The Chinese government expressed strong opposition to the congressional visit, saying it undermined China-US relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, referring to the waterway between China and Taiwan. The lawmakers’ visit “ran against the political commitment of the US government to maintain only unofficial relations with Taiwan, sending a seriously wrong signal to the separatist force of Taiwan independence,” Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said in Beijing. Lai, who took office one week ago, is expected to continue the policies of Tsai Ing-wen, his predecessor from the same Democratic Progressive Party. The new foreign minister, Lin Chia-lung, noted the recent Chinese drills and called the American delegation’s visit “an important gesture of solidarity” at a critical time. The delegation included four Republicans and two Democrats and was led by Rep. Michael McCaul, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Last year, China sanctioned the Texas Republican after he visited Taiwan in April. “America is and always will be a reliable partner, and no amount of coercion or intimidation will slow down or stop the routine visits by the Congress to Taiwan,” he said. McCaul cited congressional approval last month of a military aid bill for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. China firmly opposes the US arming Taiwan, Mao said. The other delegation members were Republicans Young Kim from California and Joe Wilson from South Carolina and Democrats Jimmy Panetta from California and Chrissy Houlahan from Pennsylvania. (AP)",

Mario and Maria Felix were walking two of their French Bulldogs near their Montebello home around 10 p.m. Sunday night when a man approached Mario at the corner of Victoria and Wilcox avenues while he was several feet away from his wife. The suspect then pointed a gun at him and demanded his Rolex watch, cash and his 2-year-old French Bulldog, Jennifer, Mario said. Jennifer is a spotted brown French Bulldog that weighs approximately 25 pounds. (Mario Felix) Jennifer is a spotted brown French Bulldog that weighs approximately 25 pounds. (Mario Felix) Jennifer is a spotted brown French Bulldog that weighs approximately 25 pounds. (Mario Felix) Despite Mario begging him to keep the dog, the thief ripped Jennifer’s leash out of Mario’s possession and fled. Video surveillance footage from a nearby building obtained by the couple shows the alleged thief exiting a sedan, and moments later, running back towards the car with what appears to be a leash with a dog on it behind him. According to Mario, the stolen Rolex is the least important thing on his mind. “They stole my property, [but] I don’t care about that,” he told KTLA 5’s Kimberly Cheng . “All I care about is Jennifer.” “We don’t have kids together, so [our dogs] are our babies,” Mario added. “[They are] all we have.” Jennifer is a spotted brown French Bulldog that weighs approximately 25 pounds. The couple has filed a police report. Anyone with information regarding the theft or Jennifer’s whereabouts is urged to contact the Montebello Police Department.

        "content": "The crazed firebug who allegedly torched a straphanger on a subway train over the weekend gave a vacant grimace in Manhattan court Monday as a judge set his bail at $250,000 — and prosecutors revealed he’s an ex-con with a lengthy rap sheet. Nile Taylor, 49 — who’s accused of tossing a flaming can of alcohol at Petrit Alijaj, 23, Saturday — has previously done prison time for gun and forgery busts, prosecutors said in Manhattan Criminal Court. Evidence in the case of his latest fiery attack is overwhelming, assistant District Attorney Aryan Ahmadian said. “This is a strong case,” Ahmadian told Judge Cori Weston. “The defendant was arrested shortly after the incident on Saturday afternoon, and he was in possession of multiple lighters, a bottle containing rubbing alcohol.” During the wild assault , Taylor allegedly set the floor of a No. 1 train ablaze when he tossed the flaming liquid at Alijaj — leaving him with severe burns on his face and chest, authorities said. Wearing a gray sweatshirt and sneakers, Taylor didn’t say a word as Weston set his bail. He stared straight ahead blankly and, at times, down at the floor during the brief hearing. “Considering the defendant’s activities and history of charges here, his criminal-conviction history... I’m going to set what the people asked, which is $250,000 cash,” Weston said. Taylor was previously convicted of criminal possession of a loaded firearm and forgery and was sentenced to two more than years in state prison, Ahmadian said. In a separate case, Taylor was allegedly captured on surveillance camera footage hurling two cans of flammable liquid at a group of people at the West 28th Street subway on Feb. 5. Taylor allegedly “identified himself” in the video footage and the police investigation is ongoing, Ahmadian said. Sign up for our Metro Daily newsletter! Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy . Never miss a story. Alijaj and his fiancee were riding a No. 1 train at the West Houston and Varick streets station at 2:45 p.m. Saturday when Taylor allegedly chucked the flaming liquid at him, setting his shirt on fire and burning up to 30% of his body. The victim later told The Post that he used his body to block his fiance from the flames. In total, Taylor was hit with two assault charges and a menacing charge in the subway fire attack case. “Without warning...[He] attacked two strangers inside of that subway train by throwing the burning liquid onto them,” Ahmadian said in court Monday. “Burning liquid lands on the floor of the subway station, causing the floor of the subway station to catch on fire.” He was also arraigned on a petit larceny charge for allegedly stealing an iPhone inside of the subway station. Taylor’s lawyer, Gretchen Resser, was silent in court aside from asking the judge about the date of the next hearing. She didn’t return The Post’s request for comment Monday. Taylor is due back in court on May 31.",

        "content": "The net is finally closing in on Lauren Bolton ’s ( Cait Fitton ) killer, as Nathan Curtis ( Christopher Harper ) was arrested in Coronation Street. The vile paedophile has been tormenting victim Bethany Platt (Lucy Fallon) for weeks, with her mum Sarah (Tina O’Brien) adamant for revenge. As viewers of the ITV soap will remember, Bethany was groomed by Nathan and later pimped out to his disgusting mates in 2017. After finally recognising his behaviour, she bravely reported him to the police and he was locked up. She got a huge shock earlier this month when he was spotted at the Weatherfield Precinct, watching on as a reconstruction of Lauren’s final movements were recorded for television. Adamant that he had something to do with the girl’s disappearance , she stole his phone and discovered that he’d subscribed to her O-Vidz account. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a webbrowser that supports HTML5video In a further twist, Gary Windass (Mikey North) attacked him , and coughed up £10k to ensure he stayed away from Bethany. In tonight’s (27th May) episode, which is the first in a special week of instalments that will see Lauren’s killer unmasked, Bethany was horrified to see her rapist drive past her on Victoria Street and smirk. Charging down to the police station, she broke down and demanded PC Craig Tinker (Colson Smith) arrest him, but he admitted there was nothing he could do. Nathan’s not allowed within 250 metres of No. 8 Coronation Street, but as he was around the corner, he wasn’t breaching the terms of his release. Sarah was furious with the situation and vowed to be the one who got rid of him. Following an off the cuff comment made by her brother David (Jack P. Shepherd), she was given food for thought and tracked down one of Lauren’s hair bobbles that had been left at the Platt residence whilst she was staying with them.

The exes - who split in December 2023 after a year together - were seen following each other as they exited their luxury hotel in Miami, Florida while a handler carried their luggage. They were spotted walking on level B1 through the parking garage as they did their best to sneak out of the oceanside resort. They both got into the back of the same car as a security guard kept watch. The two have been spending a lot of time together after they seemed to say goodbye to their relationship around Christmas time. Kendall was seen at the last two of Bad Bunny’s three concerts at Kaseya Center in Miami. They were also seen at Bad Bunny’s restaurant Gekko for dinner on Friday and they were going to Grutman’s Casadonna restaurant for lunch on Sunday.

Her hair was down and she used a glass bottle of water to try to hide her face to no avail. The older sister of Kylie Jenner added black think sunglasses even though it was dark in the garage Bunny stood out like the sun. The rapper had on bright yellow shorts with a white top that had yellow embroidery. He added slide-in Birkenstock style light brown sandals as he flashed a gold bracelet and carried a black bag. This comes after they stood out at a private dinner at Gekko Japanese Steakhouse in Miami. Following the 30-year-old Puerto Rican rapper's show at the Kaseya Center, the former couple were spotted grabbing a late-night meal together. The pair, who were escorted to a VIP room, reportedly dined for 'about an hour and 20 minutes before leaving after midnight,' an eyewitness told TMZ . Although the eyewitnesses noted that the stars did not engage in any 'outward signs of affection' that they 'still seemed to be a couple.' While leaving the restaurant, Jenner followed the three-time Grammy winner out, who turned around to make sure she was behind him, before leaving in the same SUV. This marks the second time the supermodel, 28, and singer have been seen together in a week, following their cozy reunion at Met Gala afterparty earlier this month. Last Friday, Jenner was seen attending one of his concerts in Orlando, Florida .

In mid-December, it was reported that Jenner and Bad Bunny, born Benito Martinez Ocasio, split after almost a year together . Just weeks after their breakup, the exes rang in the New Year together with mutual friends in Barbados. 'Kendall and Bad Bunny aren't petty and no drastic break up happened. You'll see them together again and again, will it lead to them getting back together romantically or a friends with benefits, those options are on the table but right now nothing is official between the two,' a source told DailyMail.com, at the time. A source told People that the duo are 'no longer a couple,' giving no details as to why.

        "content": "NFL star Brandon McManus 'accused of sexually assaulting two women on team flight to London' Two female flight attendants are seeking in excess of $1million and a jury trial McManus was released by the Jaguars but has since signed for Washington READ MORE: NFL's 2024 International Games schedule REVEALED By Ben Nagle Published: 14:35 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 15:26 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail Two women are suing the Jacksonville Jaguars and its former kicker Brandon McManus after alleging that he sexually assaulted them on a team flight to London last year. ESPN report that the women - who have not been identified - are seeking in excess of $1million and are demanding a jury trial. They allege McManus, 32, rubbed himself against them and grinded against them, and also claim the Jaguars failed to supervise their player and failed to create a safe environment for staff serving the team. The Jags played two games in London in the 2023 season, against the Atlanta Falcons at Wembley on October 1, and then against the Buffalo Bills at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on October 8. McManus played in both. The kicker was not re-signed by the team at the end of last season and has since signed a one-year, $3.6million contract with the Washington Commanders . Brandon McManus has been accused of sexually assaulting two female flight attendants McManus is pictured playing for the Jags in London, days after the alleged assault took place ESPN report that McManus, or his attorney, is set to release a statement later on Monday, and the Jaguars refused to comment when approached by the media. According to the lawsuit, the Jaguars flew to the UK on an Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings charter flight on September 28, 2023, and the two women were working as flight attendants for the team. They allege the journey 'quickly turned into a party' and that McManus and several other players 'disregarded the flight attendants' personal space, air travel safety, and federal law'. One of the women - identified only as Jane Doe I - accuses McManus of trying to kiss her while she was seated during a period of turbulence and twice grinding up against her while she was serving meals to passengers. The second woman - Jane Doe II - claims that McManus grinded against her while she was serving the second of the flight's two meals, before confronting him - only for him to 'smirk and walk away'. Jaguars players board the chartered flight to London, shortly before the allegations took place The Jaguars - who are owned by Shad Khan - are also being sued by the women for failing to supervise McManus and failing to create a safe environment for staff serving the team Doe I also claims that during the first alleged assault, she made eye contact with a different Jaguars player, who 'looked ashamed of McManus' behavior'. Doe II also alleges that when the team returned back to the USA from London after the double-header of games, she 'remained on the second story of the aircraft to avoid McManus'. The lawsuit says that the two women have experienced severe mental anguish, anxiety, psychological and emotional distress, embarrassment and humiliation. Last season, the NFL star earned $2m in his one-year contract with the Jacksonville Jaguars, following his release by the Denver Broncos. He made 30 of his 37 field-goal attempts in 2023, and all 35 of his extra-point attempts.

It is what you would hear about or read about what would be happening in Europe maybe 300, 400 years ago,\" Dr Khaled Dawas, head of gastrointestinal surgery at University College London Hospitals, told AFP in an interview. Dawas described dire conditions in Gaza, with medical staff operating virtually without supplies, power supplies intermittent and patients lying on the floor. He returned at the end of April from his two-week stint to help overstretched Palestinian hospital surgeons -- his second wartime stay there, following one in January. \"By April they were seeing this constant, constant volume of dying and dead bodies coming into the hospitals and any human wouldn't be able to tolerate it,\" he said. \"They carry on working, but you can see the effect of that. They're all extremely burdened by what they're doing.\"",

        "content": "The bodies of a young missionary couple from the U.S. who were attacked and fatally shot by gang members in Haiti are expected to be transported to Missouri this week, a spokesperson for the families said Sunday. Thursday's killings of Davy and Natalie Lloyd, and Jude Montis, the local director of a mission group, Missions in Haiti Inc., happened in the community of Lizon in northern Port-au-Prince. They were leaving a youth group activity at a church, a family member told The Associated Press. Natalie Lloyd is the daughter of Missouri state Rep. Ben Baker. Speaking on behalf of the Lloyd and Baker families in a Facebook post on Baker's page, Cassidy Anderson said Sunday that transport had been secured for a Thursday arrival of the bodies in Missouri. But Anderson added that \"security is going to be very difficult.\" Haiti's capital has been crumbling under the relentless assault of violent gangs that control 80% of Port-au-Prince, while authorities await the arrival of a police force from Kenya as part of a U.N.-backed deployment aimed at quelling gang violence in the troubled Caribbean country. Here are some things to know about the missionary work, which focused on helping the children of Haiti, and the deadly gang attack. WORKING IN HAITI Missions in Haiti's website says its goal is \"to see the Gospel of Christ make a difference in the lives of Haiti's young people.\" Davy Lloyd's parents, David and Alicia Lloyd, of Oklahoma, started the organization in 2000 seeking to focus on the children of Haiti. David and Alicia Lloyd are full-time missionaries in the country. \"Although the entire nation is steeped in poverty, the children suffer the worst,\" they wrote on the website. \"Thousands are malnourished, uneducated, and headed for hopeless lives apart from Christ.\" Hannah Cornett, Davy's sister, told AP that they grew up in Haiti.

        "content": "The bodies of a young missionary couple from the U.S. who were attacked and fatally shot by gang members in Haiti are expected to be transported to Missouri this week, a spokesperson for the families said Sunday. Thursday's killings of Davy and Natalie Lloyd, and Jude Montis, the local director of a mission group, Missions in Haiti Inc., happened in the community of Lizon in northern Port-au-Prince. They were leaving a youth group activity at a church, a family member told The Associated Press. Natalie Lloyd is the daughter of Missouri state Rep. Ben Baker.

David and Alicia Lloyd are full-time missionaries in the country. \"Although the entire nation is steeped in poverty, the children suffer the worst,\" they wrote on the website. \"Thousands are malnourished, uneducated, and headed for hopeless lives apart from Christ.\" Hannah Cornett, Davy's sister, told AP that they grew up in Haiti.

        "content": "From his eccentric rants to his trademark “Conference of Champions” quote, not to mention the zany attires and his four championships spanning college and the pros, Bill Walton left an indelible mark on the sports world. A Hall of Fame player who won two titles with the Trail Blazers, Walton died Monday at the age of 71 after a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA announced. Shortly after the league released its statement, many flocked to social media to honor one of the sport’s most unique personalities, who became a staple of ESPN’s Pac-12 broadcasts. “I’m heartbroken,” ESPN colleague Jay Bilas said on SportsCenter . “Just a genuine, beautiful person that always asked about you and as much as he could talk endlessly and captivate everyone around the table with experience from his life, that’s not what he was about. He was about asking you about yours and he was genuinely interested. One of the most generous souls I’ve ever been around. “Incredibly intelligent, well-read. I think a lot of people later in his career were captivated by his showmanship ... He may have been the greatest college basketball player of all-time. ... He was an absolutely magnificent, beautiful person that you loved to be around at all times.” . @JayBilas remembers Bill Walton ❤️ \"He may have been the greatest college basketball player of all time. He was an all-time great pro as well. ... But more than that ... He was an absolutely magnificent, beautiful person that you just loved to be around at all times.\" pic.twitter.com/oolIQZxrbu The influx of positive statements about Walton on Monday showed his legacy spanned many spheres, including college, the NBA, the media industry and humanitarian efforts. Walton first established himself as a household name by winning back-to-back championships with UCLA from 1972-73 before being selected by the Trail Blazers as the No. 1 pick in the 1974 draft. The center won two NBA titles in his career — in 1977 with Portland and in 1986 with Boston — while averaging 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds per game. Despite battling injuries that limited him throughout his career, Walton earned MVP honors for the 1977-78 season and made two All-Star teams. “Have just heard the devastating news of Bill Walton’s passing. Broken-hearted for Lori, the Walton boys & Bill’s many friends,” ESPN colleague Fran Fraschilla posted . “One of the greatest college players ever, a great humanitarian & a lover of life. ⁦I will miss you, Bill. @UCLAMBB @espn @NBA.” Julius Erving, whose 76ers lost to the Trail Blazers in the 1977 NBA Finals, called it a “blessing” to have competed against him. “I am sad today hearing that my comrade & one of the sports worlds most beloved champions & characters has passed,” Erving tweeted . “Bill Walton enjoyed life in every way. To compete against him & to work with him was a blessing in my life. Sorry for your loss Walton family. We’ll miss him too. Doc.” I am sad today hearing that my comrade & one of the sports worlds most beloved champions & characters has passed. Bill Walton enjoyed life in every way. To compete against him & to work with him was a blessing in my life. Sorry for your loss Walton family. We’ll miss him too. Doc pic.twitter.com/GAEt1DRH8N Following his playing career, Walton became an iconic broadcaster, most notably for ESPN. He became a staple of Pac-12 broadcasts alongside Dave Pasch, telling stories after midnight on the East Coast that you would not be hearing anywhere else. Perhaps nobody in sports could convince a listener that a 5-23 Oregon State team from the “Conference of Champions” could do damage in the NCAA Tournament like Walton could. His zaniness earned him a cult following and beloved status in the sport. Sign up for Starting Lineup for the biggest stories. Please provide a valid email address.

Never miss a story. “Absolutely crushed to hear of the passing of the legendary Bill Walton, whose intellect, sense of humor, and zest for life were even bigger than he was,” ESPN colleague Mike Greenberg tweeted Monday . He was also, when healthy, every bit as good a big man as there ever was, with a game that was decades ahead of his time – he’d have been perfect in today’s NBA. Sending love and condolences to his family, I will cherish the memories of our many conversations for the rest of my life.” So many good Bill Walton memories but none can top the time he devoured a cupcake with a lit candle One of one pic.twitter.com/iZ9HOL0PJE Pablo Torre of Meadowlark shared a sweet message above a funny clip from the two involving teepees. “Bill Walton laughed at himself; cared deeply about people history ignored; and was one of the greatest athletes to ever walk the Earth,” Torre posted . “A planet he both adored and transcended. RIP 💔.” Bill Walton laughed at himself; cared deeply about people history ignored; and was one of the greatest athletes to ever walk the Earth. A planet he both adored and transcended. RIP 💔 pic.twitter.com/9rCWruhGUs 76ers President of Basketball Operations Daryl Morey reflected on Walton’s humanitarian efforts in a post honoring the late big man. “RIP Bill Walton – my favorite example of his endless commitment to helping others is when he stepped in to assist the Lithuanian national basketball team as they broke away from the Soviet Union before facing the original Dream Team in 1992,” Morey posted Monday.",

        "content": "Assistant coach Jocelyn Barrieau will take charge of Canada’s women’s rugby sevens team following the Paris 2024 Olympics, Rugby Canada announced Monday. The governing body had previously announced that Jack Hanratty would step down after this summer’s Olympics to take over the University of Ottawa Gee-Gees women’s team. Barrieau joined the sevens squad as an assistant coach in May 2023 from Concordia University’s women’s rugby team. Rugby Canada said Barrieau was chosen by its high-performance staff and Own the Podium prior to the Olympics to “ensure stability and facilitate strategy planning for the women’s sevens program following Paris 2024.” The Canadian women currently stand fifth in the HSBC SVNS season standings after six events. They have been drawn in a pool with No. 1 New Zealand, the fourth-ranked U.S. and No. 8 Britain in the season’s grand final that starts Friday at Civitas Metropolitano Stadium in Madrid. While the women take part in a “winner-takes-all” eight-team competition in Madrid to decide the series champion, the Canadian men will be fighting to remain in the world sevens series. Canada, currently at the bottom of the 12-team men’s standings, will join the ninth-place U.S., No. 10 Spain and No. 11 Samoa and the winning teams from the World Rugby HSBC Sevens Challenger Series _ Chile, Germany, Kenya and Uruguay — in a relegation playoff to decide four core teams in 2025. The Canadian men will face Germany, Uruguay and the U.S. in Pool A in Madrid. The Canadian women qualified for the Paris Olympics by blanking Mexico 53-0 last August in the final of the 2023 Rugby Americas North Sevens. The Canadian men are headed to a last-ditch Olympic qualifier June 21-23 in Monaco. — This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024 .

        "content": "file photo Asad Mirza Latest reports from Myanmar, speak of new atrocities and crimes being committed in a concerted campaign of violence and destruction by Myanmar’s military against the largely Muslim Rohingya people in northern Rakhine state. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has reported of receiving frightening and disturbing reports from northern Rakhine state in Myanmar of the impacts of the conflict on civilian lives and property. Liz Throssell, spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said Friday 24 May in a briefing to journalists in Geneva, that “Some of the most serious allegations concern incidents of killing of Rohingya civilians and the burning of their property, has been received by the UN”, noting that tens of thousands of civilians have been displaced in recent days by fighting in Buthidaung and Maungdaw townships. She said that the information gathered in testimony from victims, eyewitnesses, satellite images, and online video and pictures over the last week indicate, “Buthidaung town has been largely burned.” “We have received information indicating that the burning started on May 17, two days after the military had retreated from the town and the Arakan Army claimed to have taken full control,” she said. Speaking in Bangkok, James Rodehaver, head of Myanmar Team, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, said his team had spoken to many sources on the ground and reviewed numerous materials, many of which “were deemed to be credible.” “Our offices are corroborating information further, particularly in establishing who were the perpetrators of the burning. One survivor described seeing dozens of dead bodies as he fled the town. Another survivor said that he was among a group of displaced persons numbering in the tens of thousands, who attempted to move outside of the town to safety but were blocked by the Arakan Army,” Rodehaver said, pointing out that the Arakan Army had abused survivors and extorted money from them as they fled the town. Earlier History The latest fighting comes in the context of a civil war in Myanmar that began after the army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, leading to an armed resistance opposing military rule. The pro-democracy fighters are allied with several of the ethnic minority groups that have been fighting for greater autonomy for decades, and have well-trained military forces. The Arakan Army is an armed ethnic group fighting as part of an alliance against the Myanmar military. The AA says it is fighting for more autonomy for the ethnic Rakhine population in the state, which is also home to an estimated 600,000 members of the persecuted Rohingya Muslim minority, who have chosen to remain in the country. The Arakan Army had a loose cease-fire with the military government until last October, when it joined with two other ethnic armed groups to capture territory in northeastern Myanmar. The Rohingya were the targets of a brutal counterinsurgency campaign incorporating rape and murder that saw an estimated 740,000 flee to neighbouring Bangladesh as their villages were burned down by government troops in 2017. Rohingya have lived in Myanmar for generations, but they are widely regarded by many in the country’s Buddhist majority, including members of the Rakhine minority, as having illegally migrated from Bangladesh. The Rohingya face a great amount of prejudice and are generally denied citizenship and other basic rights. Latest Incidents In the weeks leading up to the burning of Buthidaung, the Myanmar team of the UN human rights offices has documented renewed attacks on Rohingya civilians by both the Arakan Army and by the military in northern Rakhine state, including many by aerial strikes and drones. He said his office also has received reports of shooting at unarmed fleeing villagers, multiple disappearances and burnings of homes, and has confirmed four cases of beheadings. Rodehaver said the military has been actively targeting the Rohingya for years and has “actively enforced draconian and discriminatory restrictions affecting all aspects of their lives.” “It is one of the reasons why the Rohingya, whenever they were asked to leave Buthidaung and other villages, have been very reluctant to move because they have needed special permission to move outside of their township of residence. They also have nowhere else to go. “They, of course, have learned very hard lessons in 2017, knowing that whenever movement starts, it usually ends with them leaving their homes, never to see them again,” he said. The Myanmar junta, which has been at war with its people for decades, recently has suffered many defeats. One consequence is young men have been conscripted from the Rohingya to fight its battles, by promising them many benefits, such as more food rations for their families and a promise of citizenship. Rodehaver calls that an insidious ploy by military leaders. Tom Andrews, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar, warned Thursday of “ominous signs of another Rohingya bloodbath in Rakhine state” if the international community were to continue to turn a blind eye and fail to take action to save the lives of thousands of Rohingya. “Once again, the world seems to be failing a desperate people in their hour of peril, while a hate-driven unnatural disaster unfolds in real time in Myanmar’s Rakhine state,” he said. Mirroring that assessment, UN human rights chief Volker Türk is calling for “an immediate end to the violence, and for all civilians to be protected without any distinction based on identity. “Prompt and unhindered humanitarian relief must be allowed to flow, and all parties must comply fully and unconditionally with international law,” he said. More than a million Rohingya have taken shelter in neighbouring Bangladesh after fleeing Rakhine, including hundreds of thousands in 2017 during an earlier crackdown by the military that is now the subject of a United Nations genocide court case. What perplexes one here is the ominous silence of the so-called Muslim states against the Myanmar’s junta, for targeting the Rohingyas. Even the Muslim organisations like the OIC have not moved beyond passing resolutions against the massacre of Rohingyas, and have refrained from taking any firm action at the ground level to force the junta to put a stop to these inhuman massacres. The same applies to the plight of Uyghur Muslims in China. (Asad Mirza is a Delhi-based senior political and international affairs commentator.)",

        "content": "A new report finds that Canadians feel both \"optimism and concern\" over the prospect of flying cars and drones whizzing between remote communities and above city blocks. Top science and technology headlines, all in one place Top headlines on electric vehicles, and all the latest automotive news The Léger study commissioned by Transport Canada says residents hold a broadly positive attitude toward so-called advanced air mobility, which refers to both drones and electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft — drones' larger, human-piloted cousins. The survey found that despite limited knowledge of the futuristic transport mode, respondents liked advanced air mobility's potential for search and rescue, firefighting, medical use and other critical services. However, the study says concerns over safety, affordability, environmental impacts and privacy tempered enthusiasm for aerial vehicles. Air taxis, long hyped as the next giant leap in short-haul passenger transport, are coming closer to being a public reality — even as skepticism lingers over their ability to change commuter behaviour and emissions output. In the U.S., electric air taxis can start flying through the skies by 2028, according to a regulatory timeline laid out by the Federal Aviation Administration last July. Léger says its report was based on two studies carried out between November and January, with a survey sample size of 2,717 participants as well as four focus groups. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024",

The regulator says two carriers continue to dominate the skies while new airlines seem to struggle to enter the market. Top business headlines, all in one place The bureau also says domestic fares appear relatively high and that more and more passengers are filing complaints. The regulator says its market study, which will draw on feedback from the public and interested parties, will pave the way for recommendations to government that would improve competition and make it easier for consumers to make informed choices. The market study announced May 9 is the bureau's first since it gained new powers in December that include the ability to compel information from companies. Over the past 13 months, newer low-cost carriers Swoop and Lynx Air have disappeared from the skies and WestJet scooped up Sunwing Airlines, with the latter two making up 72 per cent of seat capacity from Western Canada last year, according to the bureau.",

        "description": "An emphatic victory over Kent was inspired by Essex’s outstanding bowling display,",
        "content": "Kent were skittled for just 101 in their second innings as Simon Harmer and Shane Snater led Essex’s victory charge. Harmer took four for 32 and Snater finished with three for 15 as Essex triumphed by an innings and 96 runs. Kent were 197 behind going into the final day and they lost England opener Zak Crawley early when Snater trapped him lbw. Harmer then began to inflict damage – dismissing Ben Compton and Marcus O’Riordan – and it was a steady fall of wickets after that as Kent fell away. Hopes of an exciting climax to the final day between Lancashire and Warwickshire at Emirates Old Trafford were dashed by rain, with only 75 minutes’ play possible. Warwickshire declared their second innings on 96 for three – a lead of 231 – and Lancashire finished on 89 for four from the 15 overs that were possible. Nottinghamshire’s hopes of pushing for a last-day victory over Worcestershire also were wrecked by the weather as they too had to settle for a draw at New Road. Despite two of the first three days being washed out, Nottinghamshire were strongly placed at 234 for three and leading by 154 runs, but heavy overnight rain and a steady stream of morning showers dashed any chance of play, with the visitors taking 11 points and Worcestershire nine. In Division Two, promotion front-runners Middlesex and Sussex saw their match at Lord’s peter out into a draw. A stalemate looked inevitable once the home side had avoided the follow-on early on the final day and they went on to post 613 for nine declared in reply to Sussex’s total of 554 for nine. Nathan Fernandes missed out on a century by nine runs, while Jack Davies struck a career-best 68 and Henry Brookes registered his first half-century as a Middlesex player, with off-spinner Jack Carson taking four for 166. Ricardo Vasconcelos hit an unbeaten 129 not out as he spearheaded Northamptonshire’s bid for an unlikely victory over Yorkshire, but the visitors’ bowling attack dug deep to ensure the Wantage Road clash ended in a draw. Northamptonshire had been set a challenging target of 326 in a little over two sessions and when Vasconcelos warmed up for the T20 Blast with 17 boundaries all around the ground, a home triumph looked a possibility. But a dramatic clatter of wickets as the Yorkshire attack – featuring Adam Lyth’s career-best figures of four for 56 – staged a late fightback to set nerves jangling in the home dressing room, meant Vasconcelos had to switch gears to ensure his side held out for the draw, eight wickets down. Leicestershire made it seven draws from seven championship matches this season with a stalemate against visitors Glamorgan, who ended the day on 157 for four in the second innings, 201 runs ahead. And Beau Webster completed a Gloucestershire home debut to remember against Derbyshire in another drawn encounter. The Australian all-rounder followed up his six-wicket haul in Derbyshire’s first innings of 526 by smashing 76 off just 79 balls as Gloucestershire extended their reply from an overnight 399 for four to 530 all out, with Zak Chappell claiming five for 58. Too much time had been lost to the weather, though, and the players shook hands when Derbyshire declared their second innings on 166 for four.",

Despite two of the first three days being washed out, Nottinghamshire were strongly placed at 234 for three and leading by 154 runs, but heavy overnight rain and a steady stream of morning showers dashed any chance of play, with the visitors taking 11 points and Worcestershire nine.

        "content": "[Source: Reuters] An Israeli airstrike triggered a fire that killed 45 people in a tent camp in the Gazan city of Rafah, officials said. Prompting an outcry from global leaders who urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel’s assault. Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after a strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze. Israel’s military, which is trying to eliminate Hamas in Gaza, said it was investigating reports that a strike it carried out against commanders of the Islamist militant group in Rafah had caused the fire. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strike had not been intended to cause civilian casualties. “In Rafah, we already evacuated about 1 million non-combatant residents and despite our utmost effort not to harm non-combatants, something unfortunately went tragically wrong,” he said in a speech in parliament that was interrupted by shouting from opposition lawmakers. Survivors said families were preparing to sleep when the strike hit the Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood where thousands were sheltering after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago. “We were praying...and we were getting our children’s beds ready to sleep. There was nothing unusual, then we heard a very loud noise, and fire erupted around us,” said Umm Mohamed Al-Attar, a Palestinian mother in a red headscarf. “All the children started screaming... The sound was terrifying; we felt like the metal was about to collapse on us, and shrapnel fell into the rooms.” Video footage obtained by Reuters showed a fire raging in the darkness and people screaming in panic. A group of young men tried to haul away sheets of corrugated iron and a hose from a single fire truck began to douse the flames. More than half of the dead were women, children, and elderly people, health officials in Hamas-run Gaza said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise from people with severe burns. Israel’s military said Sunday’s strike, based on “precise intelligence”, had eliminated Hamas’ chief of staff for the second and larger Palestinian territory, the West Bank, plus another official behind deadly attacks on Israelis. That followed the interception of eight rockets fired towards Israel from the Rafah area in Gaza’s southern tip. Israel has kept up its offensive despite a ruling by the top U.N. court on Friday ordering it to stop, saying the court’s ruling grants it some scope for military action there. The court also reiterated calls for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas. The U.S. urged Israel to take more care to protect civilians, but stopped short of calling for a halt to the Rafah incursion. “Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,” a National Security Council spokesperson said. “But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians.” French President Emmanuel Macron said he was “outraged” over Israel’s latest attacks. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,” he said on X. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling must be respected. “International humanitarian law applies for all, also for Israel’s conduct of the war,” Baerbock said. NO SAFE ZONE More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s offensive, Gaza’s health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. By daylight, the camp in Rafah was a smoking wreckage of tents, twisted metal and charred belongings. Women wept and men held prayers beside bodies in shrouds. Sitting beside bodies of his relatives, Abed Mohammed Al-Attar said Israel lied when it told residents they would be safe in Rafah’s western areas. His brother, sister-in-law and several other relatives were killed in the blaze. “The army is a liar. There is no security in Gaza. There is no security, not for a child, an elderly man, or a woman. Here he (my brother) is with his wife, they were martyred,” he said. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs based in the West Bank condemned “the heinous massacre.” Egypt also condemned Israel’s “deliberate bombing of the tents of displaced people”, state media reported, describing it as a blatant violation of international law. On Monday, the Israeli military said it was investigating reports of an exchange of fire between Israeli and Egyptian soldiers close to the Rafah border crossing with Gaza. Egypt’s military spokesperson said that shooting near the Rafah crossing led to the killing of one person and authorities were investigating. Israeli tanks stepped up the intensity of bombardments of eastern and central areas of Rafah on Monday, killing at least eight, local health officials said. Two medical workers were killed by a missile fired from a drone as they left the Kuwaiti hospital in Rafah, medics said. In Al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza Strip, an Israeli attack killed three Palestinian police officers, Gaza’s Hamas-run interior ministry said. Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area. But it faces global condemnation for failing to spare civilian lives. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also condemned the Israeli attack and Qatar said the Rafah strike could hinder efforts to mediate a ceasefire and hostage exchange. Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told reporters in Beirut on Monday that there were no plans for ceasefire talks and the group’s demands to achieve an accord, which include a permanent ceasefire, remain unchanged.",

MATCH DRAWN 🤝 Gloucestershire take 14 points from the match and remain in 4th place in the @CountyChamp Division Two table. #BecomeGlorious pic.twitter.com/yaheaIvotd — Gloucestershire Cricket (@Gloscricket) May 27, 2024 And Beau Webster completed a Gloucestershire home debut to remember against Derbyshire in another drawn encounter. The Australian all-rounder followed up his six-wicket haul in Derbyshire’s first innings of 526 by smashing 76 off just 79 balls as Gloucestershire extended their reply from an overnight 399 for four to 530 all out, with Zak Chappell claiming five for 58. Too much time had been lost to the weather, though, and the players shook hands when Derbyshire declared their second innings on 166 for four.",

The 28-year-old joined the club from Monaco nine years ago in a deal worth an initial £36million in 2015, making him at the time the most expensive teenager in world football. The forward will now leave Old Trafford when his contract officially expires on 1 July after making 317 appearances for United, scoring 90 goals for the club. Martial confirmed his departure in an emotional post on Instagram , thanking supporters and the club for an ‘incredibly opportunity’. ‘After nine incredible years at the club, the time has come for me to turn a new page in my career,’ he wrote. ‘Since I arrived in 2015, I have had the immense honour of wearing this shirt and playing in front of you, the best supporters in the world! You have been an unwavering support, through the good times and the difficult. ‘Your passion and loyalty have been a constant source of motivation for me. ‘I’d like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you’ve done for me. Your songs, your encouragement and your love for the club are memories that will remain engraved in my heart forever. ‘I would also like to express my gratitude to all my team-mates, technical staff and all the members of the club I have met during my 9 years here. I am proud to have been able to share these experiences with you. ‘Manchester United will always be in my heart. This club has left its mark on my career and offered me an incredible opportunity to play in front of you. ‘I’m leaving to take on new challenges, I’ll always be a Red Devil and I’ll continue to follow the club’s results with passion. ‘Thank you again for everything, and see you soon.’ While enjoying some superb seasons at the club, Martial persistently struggled with injury problems, particularly in recent years. He managed just seven starting appearances in his final season at the club, scoring two goals with a groin injury ended his season back in December. He becomes the second star to confirm he is leaving United this summer with Raphael Varane also moving on.

Bellingham has had a stellar debut season at Real Madrid. The England international clinched both LaLiga and the Spanish Super Cup titles. He has the chance to complete a treble by winning the Champions League against his former club, Borussia Dortmund, in the final on June 1. Bellingham has been exceptional, scoring 23 goals and providing 12 assists in 41 appearances across all competitions. His outstanding performance has made him a leading contender for this year’s Ballon d’Or. However, when discussing his Ballon d’Or prospects, Bellingham told The Athletic reporter, Guillermo Rai: “For me, Vinicius is the best in the world. He creates magic out of nothing. He has everything to be the best. If that’s how he feels [Vinicius said Bellingham is the best], then you can split it [Ballon d’Or] in two [laughs].” Related Topics: ballon d'or Bellingham Don't Miss Champions League: Arsenal miss out on Pot 1 for next season’s draw You may like Ballon d’Or: Toni Kroos moves up in ranking (See top 5) Ancelotti reveals Real Madrid star won’t win Ballon d’Or I’m very calm – Vinicius Jr speaks on winning 2024 Ballon d’Or UCL: Carlo Ancelotti names Real Madrid star to win Ballon d’Or after Bayern defeat UCL: Sunday Oliseh names player to win Ballon d’Or, hails Ancelotti as Real Madrid beat Bayern ‘Good guy’ – Bellingham names closest ally beyond Real Madrid Advertise About Us Contact Us Privacy-Policy Terms Copyright © Daily Post Media Ltd",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AFP): The United States said Monday Israel must make every possible effort to avoid civilian casualties, following a deadly strike that hit a displacement camp in Rafah, which Gaza’s health ministry said killed 45 people. Israel is facing a wave of international condemnation over the strike, both across the region and from the European Union, France and the United Nations. “As we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians,” a US National Security Council spokesperson said in a statement. “We are actively engaging the IDF and partners on the ground to assess what happened,” the spokesperson added. Gaza’s civil defense agency said the strike ignited a fire that tore through a displacement center in northwestern Rafah near a facility of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. “The devastating images following an IDF strike in Rafah last night that killed dozens of innocent Palestinians are heartbreaking,” the NSC spokesperson said. The Israeli military said it had launched a probe into the strike which it said was carried out based on “precise intelligence information” about two Hamas militants who it said were killed. It launched the attack on Rafah hours after Hamas unleashed a barrage of rockets towards the Tel Aviv area, most of which were intercepted. The NSC spokesperson said that “Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,” before imploring more caution. The Gaza war broke out after the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,050 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory’s health ministry.",

        "content": "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and other top officials have accused NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg of escalating tensions with Moscow over comments he made on use of Western arms by Kiev. Stoltenberg claimed last week that the “time has come” for members of the US-led military bloc to reconsider their policies and let Ukraine use Western weapons to launch strikes deep into Russian territory, RT reported. “I don’t know why Stoltenberg said such a thing, I think we have to be very careful,” Meloni told Italy’s Rai 3 TV channel on Sunday. The Italian prime minister stressed that “NATO must remain firm, not give the signal that it is giving in,” but advised “greater caution.” “There are many questionable statements,” Meloni added, recalling how she rebuked French President Emmanuel Macron over his remarks on potentially sending troops to Ukraine. Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini told an election rally on Sunday that Stoltenberg “cannot speak on behalf of the Italian people.” “NATO cannot force us to kill in Russia, nor can anyone force us to send Italian soldiers to fight or die in Ukraine,” Salvini said.",

        "content": "Assistant coach Jocelyn Barrieau will take charge of Canada’s women’s rugby sevens team following the Paris 2024 Olympics, Rugby Canada announced Monday. The governing body had previously announced that Jack Hanratty would step down after this summer's Olympics to take over the University of Ottawa Gee-Gees women’s team. Barrieau joined the sevens squad as an assistant coach in May 2023 from Concordia University’s women’s rugby team. Rugby Canada said Barrieau was chosen by its high-performance staff and Own the Podium prior to the Olympics to \"ensure stability and facilitate strategy planning for the women’s sevens program following Paris 2024.\" The Canadian women currently stand fifth in the HSBC SVNS season standings after six events. They have been drawn in a pool with No. 1 New Zealand, the fourth-ranked U.S. and No. 8 Britain in the season's grand final that starts Friday at Civitas Metropolitano Stadium in Madrid. While the women take part in a \"winner-takes-all\" eight-team competition in Madrid to decide the series champion, the Canadian men will be fighting to remain in the world sevens series. Canada, currently at the bottom of the 12-team men's standings, will join the ninth-place U.S., No. 10 Spain and No. 11 Samoa and the winning teams from the World Rugby HSBC Sevens Challenger Series — Chile, Germany, Kenya and Uruguay — in a relegation playoff to decide four core teams in 2025. The Canadian men will face Germany, Uruguay and the U.S. in Pool A in Madrid. The Canadian women qualified for the Paris Olympics by blanking Mexico 53-0 last August in the final of the 2023 Rugby Americas North Sevens. The Canadian men are headed to a last-ditch Olympic qualifier June 21-23 in Monaco. --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024 . The Canadian Press",

THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO-Rugby Canada, Mike Lee, *MANDATORY CREDIT* Assistant coach Jocelyn Barrieau will take charge of Canada’s women’s rugby sevens team following the Paris 2024 Olympics, Rugby Canada announced Monday. The governing body had previously announced that Jack Hanratty would step down after this summer's Olympics to take over the University of Ottawa Gee-Gees women’s team. Barrieau joined the sevens squad as an assistant coach in May 2023 from Concordia University’s women’s rugby team. Rugby Canada said Barrieau was chosen by its high-performance staff and Own the Podium prior to the Olympics to \"ensure stability and facilitate strategy planning for the women’s sevens program following Paris 2024.\" The Canadian women currently stand fifth in the HSBC SVNS season standings after six events. They have been drawn in a pool with No. 1 New Zealand, the fourth-ranked U.S. and No. 8 Britain in the season's grand final that starts Friday at Civitas Metropolitano Stadium in Madrid. While the women take part in a \"winner-takes-all\" eight-team competition in Madrid to decide the series champion, the Canadian men will be fighting to remain in the world sevens series. Canada, currently at the bottom of the 12-team men's standings, will join the ninth-place U.S., No. 10 Spain and No. 11 Samoa and the winning teams from the World Rugby HSBC Sevens Challenger Series — Chile, Germany, Kenya and Uruguay — in a relegation playoff to decide four core teams in 2025. The Canadian men will face Germany, Uruguay and the U.S. in Pool A in Madrid. The Canadian women qualified for the Paris Olympics by blanking Mexico 53-0 last August in the final of the 2023 Rugby Americas North Sevens. The Canadian men are headed to a last-ditch Olympic qualifier June 21-23 in Monaco. --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024 . The Canadian Press See a typo/mistake?

The governing body had previously announced that Jack Hanratty would step down after this summer's Olympics to take over the University of Ottawa Gee-Gees women’s team. Barrieau joined the sevens squad as an assistant coach in May 2023 from Concordia University’s women’s rugby team. Rugby Canada said Barrieau was chosen by its high-performance staff and Own the Podium prior to the Olympics to \"ensure stability and facilitate strategy planning for the women’s sevens program following Paris 2024.\" The Canadian women currently stand fifth in the HSBC SVNS season standings after six events. They have been drawn in a pool with No. 1 New Zealand, the fourth-ranked U.S. and No. 8 Britain in the season's grand final that starts Friday at Civitas Metropolitano Stadium in Madrid. While the women take part in a \"winner-takes-all\" eight-team competition in Madrid to decide the series champion, the Canadian men will be fighting to remain in the world sevens series. Canada, currently at the bottom of the 12-team men's standings, will join the ninth-place U.S., No. 10 Spain and No. 11 Samoa and the winning teams from the World Rugby HSBC Sevens Challenger Series — Chile, Germany, Kenya and Uruguay — in a relegation playoff to decide four core teams in 2025. The Canadian men will face Germany, Uruguay and the U.S. in Pool A in Madrid.

The former This Morning hosts revealed they had split on Saturday after work commitments 'took their marriage in different directions'. A representative said: 'Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes have confirmed their marriage is over and they are in the process of divorcing.'

They started moving in different directions in their careers and their priorities started to change.' 'Eamonn was desperate to return to Belfast, which he thinks of as home, but Ruth would never move. It became a bone of contention. 'As her ITV career continued, Eamonn went down another path and they became ships in the night. For the past two years they had led separate lives, professionally and personally.' Eamonn spoke about his desire to return to Belfast last year, revealing how his wife was always 'very irritated' when he called it home. He said last year, when asked where he thinks of as home: 'Well, it's not Surrey. When people ask me what I'm doing at the weekend, I tell them I'm going home.

        "description": "The future of the city's three Catholic primary schools is being considered.",
        "content": "Parents of pupils from an Aberdeen Catholic school have raised fears it will be shut down. Last month, Aberdeen City Council launched a feasibility study on the future of denominational schools in the city. Those who attend Holy Family RC Primary School on Summerhill Terrace are encouraging others to share their views to “save” their school. It is one of three Roman Catholic primary schools in Aberdeen alongside St Peter’s and St Joseph’s. Their catchment area covers the whole city, as well as some of Aberdeenshire. The council has said there are more spaces than needed across the three schools, which also need improvements to their buildings. The study will be used to help determine what actions the council should take with the denominational schools to avoid them “having too much unused capacity”. It is until Friday, June 7. Worries about potential school closures The current “challenges” at each primary school have been identified with Holy Family described as “one of the smallest primary schools in the city”. It adds the building may not be suitable to deliver the modern curriculum. “Significant” issues with the condition of the St Joseph’s and St Peter’s building were also raised, however, plans are already in place to refurbish and extend the latter. Once these works are completed, the three schools will have capacity for 1,085 places but a school roll of only 771 pupils. As these , any proposed options from the study will focus on reducing numbers at the other two schools. Parents from Holy Family, which 168 pupils attend, have raised fears they could be facing the closure of their school. Those who attend the school have shared a plea online for Aberdeen residents to share their views. A “Save our School” poster shared on social media states: “Every view counts. With enough responses we’ll tell Aberdeen City Council how important Holy Family is to us pupils.” Views sought on Aberdeen Catholic schools Options highlighted in the study include merging two schools into one building or changing the catchment areas to reduce capacity, as well as looking at refurbishing or rebuilding schools. The council has stated any proposals to close schools will require a formal public consultation before a decision is made. Information supporting the study states: “As the feasibility study is carried out, we are inviting pupils, parents, school staff, community groups and other stakeholders to comment on the likely options for long term Roman Catholic primary school provision, and how these options might impact on them if they were taken forwards. “Feedback received from stakeholders will be included in the feasibility study and will be considered when identifying a preferred option.” While the study focuses on the city’s primary schools, it also asks if there should be a dedicated Roman Catholic secondary school in the city. The findings will be presented to the education committee later this year. Aberdeen City Council has been contacted for comment.",

        "content": "GENEVA (AFP): Planned talks between Iran and the UN nuclear watchdog aimed at breaking the impasse over Tehran’s nuclear programme have been put on hold after the death of President Ebrahim Raisi, an agency report said Monday. The temporary suspension of talks between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) comes as its chief Rafael Grossi reiterated his concern over public statements made in Iran regarding its nuclear weapons capability. In the report, Grossi said that “further public statements made in Iran... regarding its technical capabilities to produce nuclear weapons and possible changes to Iran’s nuclear doctrine only increase... concerns about the correctness and completeness of Iran’s safeguards declarations.” Iran has always denied any ambition to develop nuclear weapon capability, insisting its activities are entirely for peaceful purposes. Earlier this month, Grossi visited Iran in a bid to improve cooperation with Tehran, urging leaders to adopt “concrete” measures to address concerns over its nuclear programme. After returning from his trip, Grossi decried “completely unsatisfactory” cooperation with Tehran, saying he would like to see “results soon”. – Breaching deal limits – But in the meantime, the deaths of Iran’s president Raisi, his foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and six others in a helicopter crash on 19 May have further complicated the situation. One day after the helicopter crash, “Iran indicated that due to the ‘special circumstances’, it was no longer appropriate to hold substantive discussions” and a new date would be set, a confidential report seen by AFP on Monday said. With presidential elections scheduled for the end of June, Grossi “reiterated... his call for, and disposition to continue” the negotiations. At the same time, Iran has significantly ramped up its nuclear programme and now has enough material to build several atomic bombs. In a separate confidential report seen by AFP ahead of an IAEA board of governors’ meeting next week, the agency said Iran’s estimated stockpile of enriched uranium had reached more than 30 times the limit set out in the 2015 accord between Tehran and world powers. According to the report, Iran’s total enriched uranium stockpile was estimated at 6,201.3 kilogrammes as of May 11, up by 675.8 kilogrammes from the last quarterly report in February. Tensions between Iran and the IAEA have repeatedly flared since a 2015 deal curbing Tehran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanction relief fell apart. EU-mediated efforts to revive the deal — bringing the US back on board and Iran back into compliance — have so far been fruitless. Nuclear weapons require uranium enriched to 90 percent, while 3.67 percent set out in the deal is enough for nuclear power stations. Iran has continued to breach further limits set out in the 2015 nuclear deal. According to the report, Iran has 751.3 kilogrammes of uranium enriched to up to 20 percent and 142.1 kilogrammes enriched to up to 60 percent. At the same time, Iran has gradually decreased its cooperation with the IAEA by deactivating surveillance devices needed to monitor the nuclear programme and barring inspectors among other measures. London, Paris and Berlin have been trying to push for a resolution condemning Iran at the IAEA Board of Governors. But the United States has been reluctant to join their efforts for fear of exacerbating the current geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, especially in the run-up to the presidential election in November. “Action by the IAEA board is long overdue,” Kelsey Davenport, an expert with the Arms Control Association, told AFP. “Waiting another six months until after the US election will only further exacerbate the challenges,” she said, by “sending the message that Tehran can flout its international obligations with impunity”. According to Davenport, the United States should put an offer on the table to “reduce the risk of conflict in the region and the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran”.",

        "description": "An Israeli airstrike triggered a fire that killed 45 people in a tent camp in the Gazan city, officials said, prompting an outcry from global leaders.",
        "content": "Cairo/Jerusalem: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli airstrike triggered a fire that officials say killed 45 people in a tent camp in the Gazan city of Rafah. The mistake only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas, with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Palestinians look at the destruction after an Israeli strike where displaced people were staying in Rafah, Gaza Strip. Credit: AP “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after a strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze. Israel’s military, which is trying to eliminate Hamas in Gaza, said it was investigating reports that a strike it carried out against commanders of the Islamist militant group in Rafah had caused the fire. Survivors said families were preparing to sleep when the strike hit the Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood where thousands were sheltering after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago. A screenshot of footage from southern Israel that shows flames and smoke rising from what Palestinian medics say is an Israeli airstrike in Gaza. Credit: AP “We were praying ... and we were getting our children’s beds ready to sleep. There was nothing unusual, then we heard a very loud noise, and fire erupted around us,” said Umm Mohamed Al-Attar, a Palestinian mother in a red headscarf. “All the children started screaming... The sound was terrifying; we felt like the metal was about to collapse on us, and shrapnel fell into the rooms.” Video footage obtained by Reuters showed a fire raging in the darkness and people screaming in panic. A group of young men tried to haul away sheets of corrugated iron and a hose from a single fire truck began to douse the flames. More than half of the dead were women, children, and elderly people, health officials in Hamas-run Gaza said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise from people with severe burns. Israel’s military said Sunday’s strike, based on “precise intelligence”, had eliminated Hamas’ chief of staff for the second and larger Palestinian territory, the West Bank, plus another official behind deadly attacks on Israelis. That followed the interception of eight rockets fired towards Israel from the Rafah area in Gaza’s southern tip. Israel has kept up its offensive despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop, saying the court’s ruling grants it some scope for military action there. The court also reiterated calls for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas. The US urged Israel to take more care to protect civilians, but stopped short of calling for a halt to the Rafah incursion. “Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,” a National Security Council spokesperson said. “But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians.” French President Emmanuel Macron said he was “outraged” over Israel’s latest attacks. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,” he said on X. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling must be respected. “International humanitarian law applies for all, also for Israel’s conduct of the war,” Baerbock said. More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s offensive, Gaza’s health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on October 7, killing around 1200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. By daylight, the camp in Rafah was a smoking wreckage of tents, twisted metal and charred belongings. Women wept and men held prayers beside bodies in shrouds. Sitting beside bodies of his relatives, Abed Mohammed Al-Attar said Israel lied when it told residents they would be safe in Rafah’s western areas. His brother, sister-in-law and several other relatives were killed in the blaze. “The army is a liar. There is no security in Gaza. There is no security, not for a child, an elderly man, or a woman. Here he (my brother) is with his wife, they were martyred,” he said. Palestinians react next to the destruction after an Israeli strike where displaced people were staying in Rafah, Gaza Strip. Credit: AP The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs based in the West Bank condemned “the heinous massacre.” Egypt also condemned Israel’s “deliberate bombing of the tents of displaced people”, state media reported, describing it as a blatant violation of international law. On Monday, the Israeli military said it was investigating reports of an exchange of fire between Israeli and Egyptian soldiers close to the Rafah border crossing with Gaza. Egypt’s military spokesperson said that shooting near the Rafah crossing led to the killing of one person and authorities were investigating. Israeli tanks stepped up the intensity of bombardments of eastern and central areas of Rafah on Monday, killing at least eight, local health officials said. Two medical workers were killed by a missile fired from a drone as they left the Kuwaiti hospital in Rafah, medics said. In Al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza Strip, an Israeli attack killed three Palestinian police officers, Gaza’s Hamas-run interior ministry said. Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area, but it faces global condemnation for failing to spare civilian lives. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also condemned the Israeli attack and Qatar said the Rafah strike could hinder efforts to mediate a ceasefire and hostage exchange. Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told reporters in Beirut on Monday that there were no plans for ceasefire talks and the group’s demands to achieve an accord, which include a permanent ceasefire, remain unchanged.

        "content": "The Skokie Fire Department’s honor guard marched up an aisle between rows of spectators, their ceremonial axes glistening silver, to start Skokie’s Memorial Day ceremony Monday. Skokie Fire Chief Jeff Hoeflich welcomed speakers including Dan Ryan, a U.S. Navy veteran who had worked as the village’s finance director from 1980 to 1990 and later served on the police pension board. When Ryan’s father, who had served in World War II, was alive the two traveled to the National World War II museum in New Orleans, which in 2014 had a special exhibit on Higgins boats, Ryan said, describing the vessels as those in which the front half opens up to let troops storm out. The Skokie Fire Department honor guard stood during the singing of “God Bless America” at the village’s Memorial Day ceremony Monday. (Pam DeFiglio, Chicago Tribune/Pioneer Press) “They had a book where veterans could write their remembrances of Higgins boats,” Ryan said, adding he was surprised to see his father writing in it, since he had never previously mentioned anything about the subject. He later peeked at what his father’s entry. It described how one day in April 1945 in Okinawa, his father’s ship released its Higgins boats, watched the troops inside them successfully make it onshore and said the boatswains brought the Higgins boats back to the ship. The Skokie police honor guard performed a Memorial Day ceremony rifle salute Monday. (Pam DeFiglio, Chicago Tribune/Pioneer Press) “As we pulled away, we passed and gave honors to the ship that was taking our place (to deposit more Higgins boats and sailors). At that moment, the other vessel was hit catastrophically by a kamikaze pilot. We spent the next hours assisting the ship, caring for the wounded and recovering and respecting the dead,” Ryan’s father wrote, according to Ryan’s recollection. The moment of solemnity continued as a Niles North High School student sang the national anthem and the Skokie Police honor guard marched to a grassy area behind the speakers and performed a rifle salute. Rabbi Moshe Wolf gave a benediction, thanking honored heroes and their families and praying that first responders arrive home safely after their tours of duty.

RSF said it was asking the ICC's prosecutor to investigate war crimes committed by the Israeli army against at least nine Palestinian reporters since December 15, AFP reported. The ICC said in January it was probing potential crimes against journalists since the outbreak of Israel’s war on Gaza, which has cost the lives of more than 100 reporters. RSF said it had \"reasonable grounds for thinking that some of these journalists were deliberately killed and that the others were the victims of deliberate IDF attacks against civilians.\" This specific complaint -- the third the RSF has made -- concerns eight Palestinian journalists killed between December 20 and May 20, and one other who sustained injuries. \"All concerned journalists were killed (or injured) in the course of their work,\" RSF said in a statement.",

        "content": "ONE of Loose Women's favourite panelists has sparked rumours that she is set to leave the show for good so she can be a full-time mum. Stacey Solomon , 34, made the confession during a heartfelt chat about how she manages to juggle her hectic workload with her five children. The busy mum, who also presents two primetime home renovation programmes, admitted that she wants to quit TV forever. Stacey has decided she would rather be a stay-at-home parent so she can be on-hand for her youngest children; Rex, five, Rose, two, and 15-month-old Belle. Stacey told beauty entrepreneur Caroline Hirons in her Glad We Had This Chat podcast : \"Every year I have a team meeting with my agent and everyone on the team to say, 'What's your plan? What's your goal?' \"And this year when they asked me my five-year goal, I was like, I want to be a stay-at-home mum. That is my dream, it's my ultimate dream. \"I just want to be with my kids.\" Stacey said she has made the decision to step back from work following the realisation that her eldest son Zachary, 16, is poised to become a grown-up. Her second eldest, Leighton, is already 12 and in senior school. Stacey admitted to Caroline that she feels she's 'missed out' on her eldest sons' childhoods. \"I definitely feel like I'm at a pivotal moment in my life where Zachary is about to leave school and become an adult,\" Stacey said. \"I think I'm at a point in my life where I recognise that I've been really busy for his life. And his life is at a really important point. \"My second son will get to that point before I know it. And then I've got these three babies. \"I don't want to feel like I missed what I potentially missed with my older children and I want to be there for my older children, who I think need me now more than ever. I've been battling that in my head.\" Stacey first joined the Loose Women panel in 2016 and she became a firm favourite among viewers. But since then, she has welcomed her youngest three children with husband Joe Swash and her workload has increased tenfold. Among her ventures, Stacey has clothing line with high street giant Primark and she hosts Sort Your Life Out on the BBC , and Renovation Rescue on Channel 4 . As a result, she has not appeared on Loose Women as a regular panelist for 18 months, aside from several guest slots. Only this month, Stacey's co-star Linda Robson said Stacey was \"too busy\" to return to the show full-time. \"I would love her to come back, she’s a really good Loose Woman - she’s really honest. But I think she’s got too much on,\" Linda told The Sun. Stacey admitted to Caroline that she may one day regret stepping back from work, as she also believes it is important for her kids to see her achieving her own dreams. She said: \"It's conflicting because I want to fulfil my dreams and my goals and the things I'm passionate about. If I don't have that, will I feel unfulfilled? \"What I'm trying to do at this point, is make sure everything I work on I can work on 90 per cent of the time at home. And then just do passion projects outside of the house and try and be around for them more.\" Stacey added: \"I just love it. I love being a mum.\"",

        "content": "PYONGYANG (AFP): North Korea’s latest attempt to put a spy satellite into orbit ended in a mid-air explosion, Pyongyang said late Monday, hours after its announcement of a planned launch was criticised by Seoul and Tokyo. Putting a spy satellite into orbit has long been a top priority for Kim Jong Un’s regime, and it claimed to have succeeded in November, after two failed attempts last year. Seoul claims Kim received Russian technical assistance for that launch, in return for sending containers of weapons to Moscow for use in Ukraine. But its attempt Monday to launch the “Malligyong-1-1” reconnaissance satellite ended in failure after it “exploded in the air during the first flight stage and failed to launch,” the North’s National Aerospace Technology Administration said in a statement. An “expert review concluded that the cause of the accident was the operational reliability of the newly developed liquid oxygen and oil engine,” the statement, carried by the official Korean Central News Agency, added. Japanese broadcaster NHK ran footage of what appeared to be a flaming projectile in the night sky, which then exploded into a fireball, saying it had filmed it from northeast China at the same time as the attempted launch. Pyongyang had notified Japan earlier Monday that it was planning to put another satellite into orbit, prompting criticism from both Seoul and Tokyo, which urged Kim to call it off. South Korea’s military said it had detected the launch but that the satellite “is presumed to have exploded in the air”. “The South Korean and US intelligence authorities are analysing it in detail in close cooperation,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff said. Nuclear-armed North Korea is barred by multiple UN resolutions from tests using ballistic technology, and analysts say there is significant technological overlap between space launch capabilities and the development of ballistic missiles. The launch “is a provocative act that clearly violates the UN Security Council resolution prohibiting the use of ballistic missile technology,” South Korea’s military said. Japan briefly issued an alert warning residents of southern Okinawa prefecture to take cover in shelters, but it was lifted minutes later. Hours after trilateral The attempted launch came just hours after Seoul, Beijing and Tokyo wrapped up their first trilateral summit since 2019. South Korea’s President Yoon Suk Yeol said Monday that another satellite launch — North Korea’s fourth attempt — would “undermine regional and global peace and stability”. The South Korean military conducted attack formation flight and strike training on Monday to demonstrate “the strong capabilities and will of our military” after North Korea notified Japan of its plans to launch a satellite by June 4. Experts say that spy satellites could improve North Korea’s intelligence-gathering capabilities, particularly over South Korea, and provide crucial data in any military conflict. Kim met President Vladimir Putin in Russia last September, and Putin suggested afterwards that his nation could help Pyongyang build satellites. Seoul and Washington have both subsequently accused Pyongyang of shipping weapons to Moscow, with South Korea saying earlier this year that Pyongyang had sent thousands of containers of weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine. A group of Russian engineers entered North Korea to help with the launch preparations, Yonhap reported Sunday, citing a government official. North Korea claims the “Malligyong-1” satellite it put into orbit in November is successfully functioning, but Seoul’s intelligence agency has cast down on this claim. The North’s two failed attempts last year included one in May which failed due to the “abnormal” startup of its second-stage engine, Pyongyang state media said at the time, and one in August which was attributed to an error in the “emergency blasting system”. Seoul’s National Intelligence Service collected and analysed debris from one of Pyongyang’s failed launches earlier last year, finding it had no military utility.",

        "content": "This is a series of three articles that try to assess the state of superpower rivalry between the US and China. Part 1 looked at the economic and technology warfare; Part 2 looks at balance sheet of geopolitical influence; and Part 3 will be the general assessment of changing global situation following years of intense US-China superpower rivalry. Current balance sheet of geopolitical influence Looking at Asia, where China calls home, the general news are not favorable for China. China is losing ground in Asia in terms of US-China superpower rivalry. According to western media narratives, China has made almost every Asian country surrounding it uneasy, uncomfortable, if not a clear-cut enemy. Many countries in Southeast Asia are having problems with China partially due to their own territorial contest and partially due to immense pressure from the US. There is not much positive news about China in Asia. And in this current environment, even if some countries wish to build closer and stronger relations with China, they are facing an extremely heavy peer pressure, and even reputational attacks from the Western-aligned media. Cambodia is the case in point. Cambodia is a footnote in hyping China’s fear in Asia. It does not matter how much Cambodia explains about its agency, Cambodia will continue to be a target of smearing campaigns because attacking Cambodia means attacking China. Whether Cambodia can cut its ties with China, this is an indecent proposal for any country that puts their national security first. What we can say from this general situation is that Asia is probably not ready for China’s leadership. China needs to reconsider why it has made many countries in Asia feel uncomfortable. A superpower is always a superpower. A superpower can be arrogant, over-confident and a bully, and no one can do anything about it. China needs to make sure that it does not have such characteristic traits in its dealing with smaller Asian nations. The US has played well in Asia, dominating the narrative of China’s danger, bringing Vietnam, India, Japan, Philippines, altogether to counter China. Australia also decided to buy nuclear submarines through an AUKUS secret deal in contravention of non-proliferation regime, and without a guarantee to safeguard nuclear proliferation in the Asia-Pacific region. Current China’s alienation in Asia also tells that many countries fear the US even if they want close relations with China. In a sense, Asian countries fear both the US and China. They want a stronger China, but they are not comfortable with its unchecked rising. They want the US to help balance power with China, but they don’t want the US to create any mess such as armed conflicts in the region. When China is not welcomed in many parts of Asia, it is being warmly welcomed in other parts of the world. That is Europe. When countries in Asia fear of China, countries in Europe fear of the US. Despite news attacking China in Europe or European governments’ unfriendly statements against China, we need to look much deeper beyond official statements to clearly see how much some major European statesmen really need China. In France, President Xi Jinping and his wife were welcomed by President Macron and his wife, in a way that the world has never seen before both in terms of personal attention and state’s honoring and splendor. The more than a hundred cavalry troops surrounding the motorcade of President Xi Jinping made us wonder when was the last time that France had received a foreign statesman in such an elaborated and gigantic manner. France’s rationale is that it wants to play a distinctive role and carve a diplomatic space for Europe within a multipolar world. It does not want France and Europe to become a follower or little brother of the US. Another important rationale is that France is viewing the US as part of the European problem, especially through the Russo-Ukrainian war. France does not see that the US is willing to stop the war that continues to weaken both Russia and the whole of Europe. In such circumstance, France views China as a strategic partner that can talk to Russia, specifically President (Vladimir) Putin, to find a way to end the war. It is not by chance that Xi Jinping was visiting France on 6-7 May and later receiving Putin in Beijing on 16-17 May. To end the Russo-Ukrainian war, to create more space for Europe to play in the global order, and to create a multipolar world that could limit the US’ hegemony, are the important goals where France and China’s interest merges. France is not alone. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also shares similar view about China’s role in the current world order. He visited China for the second times, from 14 to 16 April. When China and Europe are exchanging top leaders’ visit, people seem to lose track when was the last time that major European top leaders were visiting the White House. This manifests a clear lack of trust, confidence and lack of warmth within the traditional ties between the US and Europe. China has played well in Europe. Europe doesn’t trust the US in finding peace for them through their continued provision of weapons to Ukraine at an extraordinary debt level. US foreign aid has prolonged the crisis in Ukraine. As of January 2023, the US commitment to Ukraine amounted to $76.8 billion, of which military aid accounted for the largest share, $46.5 billion, or 61 percent. 40 percent of US military aid to Ukraine is used for the mandatory purchase of US equipment and training services, known as “tied aid.” Part of the military aid is a financial loan that will become a long-term liability for Ukraine. Thus far, the US has succeeded in bleeding Russia. It will take a long time to heal. President Putin cannot be popular with such a prolonged war. Despite that, President Putin was assuming his fifth term in power, his reputation as a wartime president is bad for history especially when the war lingers into the third year. He used to walk into the Kremlin in the most spectacular and powerful way. In his inauguration, although with much fanfare, the applause seems soundless. For any nation’s people, a president with a losing cause is not to be respected or loved by history. The applause was not because of people’s respect to his presidency. There is no light for his presidency until he can find a concluding point, like what the US did in Vietnam War. No president can sustain popularity with a prolonged war. So, what we can say is that the multipolar world is irresistible even if the US tries to stop it because other major powers in Europe always harbor the ambition to play an influential role on their own instead of following the orders from Washington. The US is winning the war of influence and perception in Asia, at China’s backyard; while China is gaining more influence in Europe, making more friends with the US’ allies or cultural cousins. And Russia is losing its role within superpower competition. The author is a Phnom Penh based analyst. The views expressed here are the author’s own.",

        "description": "An emphatic victory over Kent was inspired by Essex’s outstanding bowling display,",
        "content": "Essex moved just two points behind Vitality County Championship Division One leaders Surrey after crushing Kent at Canterbury . Kent were skittled for just 101 in their second innings as Simon Harmer and Shane Snater led Essex’s victory charge. Harmer took four for 32 and Snater finished with three for 15 as Essex triumphed by an innings and 96 runs. Kent were 197 behind going into the final day and they lost England opener Zak Crawley early when Snater trapped him lbw. Harmer then began to inflict damage – dismissing Ben Compton and Marcus O’Riordan – and it was a steady fall of wickets after that as Kent fell away. Hopes of an exciting climax to the final day between Lancashire and Warwickshire at Emirates Old Trafford were dashed by rain, with only 75 minutes’ play possible. Warwickshire declared their second innings on 96 for three – a lead of 231 – and Lancashire finished on 89 for four from the 15 overs that were possible. Nottinghamshire’s hopes of pushing for a last-day victory over Worcestershire also were wrecked by the weather as they too had to settle for a draw at New Road. Despite two of the first three days being washed out, Nottinghamshire were strongly placed at 234 for three and leading by 154 runs, but heavy overnight rain and a steady stream of morning showers dashed any chance of play, with the visitors taking 11 points and Worcestershire nine. In Division Two, promotion front-runners Middlesex and Sussex saw their match at Lord’s peter out into a draw. A stalemate looked inevitable once the home side had avoided the follow-on early on the final day and they went on to post 613 for nine declared in reply to Sussex’s total of 554 for nine. Nathan Fernandes missed out on a century by nine runs, while Jack Davies struck a career-best 68 and Henry Brookes registered his first half-century as a Middlesex player, with off-spinner Jack Carson taking four for 166. Ricardo Vasconcelos hit an unbeaten 129 not out as he spearheaded Northamptonshire’s bid for an unlikely victory over Yorkshire, but the visitors’ bowling attack dug deep to ensure the Wantage Road clash ended in a draw. Northamptonshire had been set a challenging target of 326 in a little over two sessions and when Vasconcelos warmed up for the T20 Blast with 17 boundaries all around the ground, a home triumph looked a possibility. But a dramatic clatter of wickets as the Yorkshire attack – featuring Adam Lyth’s career-best figures of four for 56 – staged a late fightback to set nerves jangling in the home dressing room, meant Vasconcelos had to switch gears to ensure his side held out for the draw, eight wickets down. Leicestershire made it seven draws from seven championship matches this season with a stalemate against visitors Glamorgan, who ended the day on 157 for four in the second innings, 201 runs ahead. And Beau Webster completed a Gloucestershire home debut to remember against Derbyshire in another drawn encounter. The Australian all-rounder followed up his six-wicket haul in Derbyshire’s first innings of 526 by smashing 76 off just 79 balls as Gloucestershire extended their reply from an overnight 399 for four to 530 all out, with Zak Chappell claiming five for 58. Too much time had been lost to the weather, though, and the players shook hands when Derbyshire declared their second innings on 166 for four.",

        "content": "BINT JBEIL, Lebanon (AP) — An Israeli strike targeting a motorcycle in southern Lebanon hit next to a hospital entrance Monday, killing the motorcycle driver and a hospital security guard and wounding several civilians nearby, local health officials said. It was not immediately clear who the driver was or why he was targeted in the strike in the town of Bint Jbeil. The Israeli army did not give a statement on the strike but said it had targeted other areas of southern Lebanon in response to “terrorist launches.” The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has been exchanging strikes with Israeli forces in the border area almost daily since Oct. 8, a day after the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza began. Mohammed Suleiman, director of the Salah Ghandour Hospital in Bint Jbeil, said they had initially received one person killed and nine wounded in the strike, most of whom were “civilians who were in front of the hospital, where family members and people accompanying the patients usually gather.” Hospital officials later said that a security guard who was wounded in the strike had died. The strike also caused minor damage to the hospital, an Associated Press photographer at the scene said. Hezbollah later said it had launched a barrage of dozens of missiles at Meron, Safsufa and Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel in response. Israeli strikes have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon since the war in Gaza began, most of them militants with Hezbollah and allied groups but also including more than 70 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, strikes from Lebanon have killed 15 soldiers and 10 civilians. The clashes have displaced tens of thousands on each side of the border. Israeli officials have said they may launch an offensive in Lebanon if no diplomatic solution is reached that would allow the displaced to return. The Israeli military said Monday that its reservists had in recent weeks “conducted a division-level and brigade-level exercise that simulated ground operations in Lebanon.\" Hezbollah legislator Hassan Fadlallah, who visited the site of the strike in Bint Jbeil, said that Israel “will not be able to return settlers (residents) to the north in this way.” “The only way to stop everything that is happening in the region today and on the border with Lebanon is to stop the aggression against Gaza,” he said. Western countries, in particular the U.S. and France, have come forward with a series of proposals for a cessation of hostilities on the Lebanon-Israel border. Hezbollah has refused to enter into an agreement until a cease-fire is implemented in Gaza. Initially, the proposals stipulated that Hezbollah would move its forces several kilometers away from the border, but a French diplomatic official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing negotiations said the latest proposal has abandoned this idea as Hezbollah would not agree to it unless Israel also halted its overflights in Lebanese airspace. Instead, the new proposal would rely on a strengthened presence of the official Lebanese army and UNIFIL peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon to enforce the cessation of hostilities, with a long-term aim of negotiations for demarcation of the land border between Lebanon and Israel. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian was expected to arrive in Beirut on a diplomatic visit Tuesday. Associated Press staff writer Abby Sewell in Beirut contributed to this report.",

The landslide occurred in the mountainous Enga region in northern Papua New Guinea on Friday and the latest missing figure is a sharp rise from earlier estimates, CNN reported. Locals have been left reeling after tons of rock and mud smashed into their homes as they slept. Rescuers have struggled to reach such a remote part of what is already one of Asia’s poorest nations leaving locals with little choice but to dig through the collapsed mountainside with whatever tools they have.",

        "content": "GAZA (AFP): Men cleared away the charred debris of shelters and children salvaged food in Gaza’s southern city of Rafah on Monday after an Israeli strike torched a camp for displaced Palestinians. “People were not just injured or killed, but charred,” 24-year-old Mohammed Hamad told AFP in the aftermath of the strike that killed at least 45 people. The death toll came from the health ministry in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, which also said that 249 people were wounded in the strike. “My cousin’s daughter, a child no more than 13, was among the martyrs. She had no features at all because shrapnel tore off her face,” Hamad said. Israel’s military said its aircraft “struck a Hamas compound in Rafah” on Sunday night, killing two senior officials for the Palestinian militant group in the occupied West Bank. The strike caused a fire that blazed through the camp in the Rafah governorate’s Tal Al-Sultan area, reducing tents and shelters to ashes. Footage released by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society showed chaotic nighttime scenes of ambulances racing to the attack site and evacuating the wounded, including children. As Palestinians cleared the site on Monday, only blackened metal sheeting and charred planks remained, the tent shelters having been all but obliterated. “When these rockets fall on a tower block there are dozens of martyrs, so what about when they are tents?” lamented a man called Hamad. “When we heard the sound (of the explosion), the sky suddenly lit up,” displaced Palestinian Muhannad, an eyewitness, told AFP. “We saw charred bodies and dismembered limbs as a result of the use of (...) missiles that caused a massive fire,” the director of Gaza’s civil defence agency, Mohammad al-Mughayyir, said. ‘Ground shook violently’ Mughayyir, who oversaw the response to the fire, said on Monday “rescue and retrieval operations concluded last night, while efforts to extinguish the fire continued for 45 minutes”. He said battling the inferno was made even more difficult because of fuel and water shortages. “We also saw cases of amputations, injured children, women, and elderly among the dead,” he added. Displaced Palestinians who had sought shelter in the area after being told by the Israelis to evacuate their homes were shocked when the camp was targeted. “They dropped leaflets asking us to go to the humanitarian zone in Tal al-Sultan, so we complied and came here,” Abu Muhammad, who was displaced from north Gaza five months ago, told AFP. “But yesterday when I was having dinner at sunset, suddenly it felt like there was an earthquake — the ground shook violently,” he said. Mohammed Abu Qamar, 27, said he was equally baffled by the strikes, after he too moved from north Gaza to the camp that had been labelled a “safe zone” by the Israeli authorities. “Yesterday evening, to our surprise, the camp was bombarded with rockets in this supposedly safe place,” he told AFP on Monday. “A fire broke out, and children, women, and old people were burned.” At the Tel Al-Sultan Clinic, body bags of white sheeting lay on the floor of a room before the dead were taken away for burial in pickup trucks. “She was seven months pregnant ... her room was bombed,” Ahmad Miqdad told AFP in tears at the clinic. His only sister, Yasmine, was killed in the strike and her body could not be recovered because it was blown to pieces in the explosion, he said. “She was preparing to welcome her new baby. What did this innocent child do to deserve this?”. Israel’s government said on Monday it was looking into the “grave and awful” impact on Palestinian civilians of the previous night’s strike. The military said it had launched an investigation. The Gaza war began after the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel that killed more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,050 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory’s health ministry.",

        "content": "Birmingham [UK], May 27 (ANI): Researchers found that a particular brain region--which they identified through a study of patients who had brain damage to that region--controls our willingness to assist others. Understanding the areas of the brain associated with \"helping\" decisions is crucial to comprehending how people could be inspired to take on major global issues like infectious diseases, climate change, and international conflict. It is also necessary to discover novel treatments for social interaction difficulties. Researchers from the Universities of Birmingham and Oxford conducted the study, which was published in Nature Human Behaviour. It demonstrates for the first time how the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a brain region, plays a crucial role in helpful, or \"prosocial,\" activities. Lead author Professor Patricia Lockwood said: \"Prosocial behaviours are essential for addressing global challenges. Yet helping others is often effortful and humans are averse to effort. Understanding how effortful helping decisions are processed in the brain is extremely important.\" In the study, the researchers focused on the vmPFC, a region located right at the front of the brain, which is known to be important for decision-making and other executive functions. Previous studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scanning) have linked the vmPFC to choices that involve a trade-off between the rewards available and the effort required to obtain rewards. However, these techniques cannot show whether a part of the brain is essential for these functions. Three groups of participants were recruited for the study. 25 patients had vmPFC damage, 15 patients had damage elsewhere in the brain, and 40 people were healthy age and gender-matched control participants. These groups allowed the researchers to test the impact of damage to vmPFC specifically. Each participant attended an experiment where they met another person anonymously. They then completed a decision-making task that measured how willing they were to exert physical effort (squeezing a grip force device) to earn rewards (bonus money) for themselves and for the other person. By enabling participants to meet - but not see - the person they were 'working' for in advance, researchers were able to convey the sense that participants' efforts would have real consequences, but hide any information about the other person that could affect decision-making. Each choice the participants made varied in how much bonus money for them or the other person was available, and how much force they would have to exert to obtain the reward. This allowed the researchers to measure the impact of reward and effort separately, and to use advanced mathematical modelling to precisely quantify people's motivation. The results of the study clearly showed that the vmPFC was necessary for motivation to help others. Patients with vmPFC damage were less willing to choose to help others, exerted less force on even after they did decide to help, and earned less money to help others compared to the control groups. In a further step, the researchers used a technique called lesion symptom mapping which enabled them to identify even more specific subregions of the vmPFC where damage made people particularly antisocial and unwilling to exert effort for the other person. Surprisingly, damage to a nearby but different subregion made people relatively more willing to help. Co-lead author Dr Jo Cutler said: \"As well as better understanding prosocial motivation, this study could also help us to develop new treatments for clinical disorders such as psychopathy, where understanding the underlying neural mechanisms can give us new insights into how to treat these conditions.\" \"This region of the brain is particularly interesting because we know that it undergoes late development in teenagers, and also changes as we get older,\" added Professor Lockwood. \"It will be really interesting to see whether this area of the brain can also be influenced by education - can we learn to be better at helping others?\" (ANI)",

        "description": "TEHRAN - In a note, the Iran newspaper pointed out the discredit of the opposition in the eye of the Iranian people and said: The false illusion of the anti-Iranian opposition has once again appeared with the epic of the Iranian people and the world's respect for the martyred president of the Islamic Republic.",
        "content": "TEHRAN - In a note, the Iran newspaper pointed out the discredit of the opposition in the eye of the Iranian people and said: The false illusion of the anti-Iranian opposition has once again appeared with the epic of the Iranian people and the world's respect for the martyred president of the Islamic Republic. This can be seen from the nervous reaction of the anti-revolution movement to the expression of sympathy and condolence of the heads of the countries regarding the martyrdom of our country's president. The Iranian opposition is angrier than ever. Recently, the employees of Zionist International TV criticized and expressed dissatisfaction with the expressions of sympathy and respect, especially from international organizations and even NATO, towards the president of Iran. They said: \"It is a joke that we could not stop this global solidarity with Iran. We should have stopped world leaders from condoling and expressing sympathy with Iran. Why did the countries fly their flags at half-mast?! Why did NATO offer condolences?!\" These are questions that not only the Persian employees of the Zionist regime but also the entire opposition movement neither have an answer for nor can accept. In an analysis, Donya-e-Eqtesad discussed Biden's words about the expansion of NATO's actions in the Middle East and wrote: The thought of NATO expansion should be considered a threat to Iran. Iran believes that the expansion of NATO means the expansion of threats, and the role of the United States alongside the countries of the Persian Gulf creates a new form of hybrid threat. This event will lead to establishing the regional security structure through the actors who are considered among America's allies in the region. Another point is that collective security will have more widespread validity and effectiveness. Naturally, the military presence of extra-regional powers in the Middle East limits the freedom of action of other countries and increases the level of monitoring of Iran's military power at the regional level and political sensitivities towards Iran's behavior. Also, such a presence will cause the regional competitors of the Islamic Republic of Iran to have more motivation to take risks. Hamshahri talked with Abdolreza Farjirad, an expert on geopolitical issues, and wrote about Iran-U.S. negotiations: Iran and the U.S. should negotiate with each other secretly. Whether we like it or not, America has interests in the region and Iran is also a regional power. Therefore, the two countries must interact so that tension and conflict in the region do not increase. Second, concessions are exchanged, which is common in diplomacy, and based on this exchange of concessions, the national and political interests of the two countries are provided to the best of their ability. America has a challenging election ahead, and Biden is looking for the tensions in the Middle East to be finished by the time of the election, or to be reduced to a point where it will not have much impact on the election. On the other hand, Iran is a regional power. America realized that it could not do anything without interaction with Iran. Therefore, America postponed the nuclear negotiations and JCPOA until after the elections. Iran and the United States have entered the next phase of negotiations, which is to reduce tension, and both countries have chosen the right way to proceed with secret negotiations in order to secure the interests of both sides by reducing tension. In an article, Farhikhtegan addressed Biden's confession about the operation of True Promise and said: After this operation, the West tried to make achievements by speaking for the Zionist regime, but they are forced to make confessions that they refused to express before. Recently, Biden said that 99% of the drones that Iran fired at Israel did not reach their targets with the help of American defense, otherwise this attack would have been devastating. In this speech, Biden tried to magnify America's power in this operation. According to the radio of the Zionist regime, the American defense systems fired 8 missiles from the sea to counter the Iranian ballistic missiles. Except for two missiles, the American defense system did not succeed in destroying most of the Iranian ballistic missiles and failed. Biden tried to show American power and hide the failure in an operation that cost more than a billion dollars for the United States and the Zionist regime. It should be noted that this attempt is related to the growth in demand for the purchase of weapons especially Iranian drones as Iranian drones are very efficient for many countries. And this is not pleasant for America.",
