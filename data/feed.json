        "content": "By: PTI Geneva May 28, 2024 00:30 IST Follow Us Facebook Twitter whatsapp World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday referred to the Global Traditional Medicine Centre set up in India and the first global summit on traditional medicine hosted by the country as he underlined that the year 2023 was a productive one in the UN health agency's work supporting access to medicines and other health products. \"We also established the Global Traditional Medicine Centre in India, and hosted the first global summit on traditional medicine,\" Ghebreyesus said in his remarks as he presented his report to the 77th World Health Assembly in Geneva. In March 2022, the Government of India and the UN health agency had signed an agreement to establish the WHO Global Centre for Traditional Medicine. This global knowledge centre for traditional medicine, supported by an investment of USD 250 million from India, aims to harness the potential of traditional medicine from across the world through modern science and technology to improve the health of people and the planet, the UN health agency had said in a press release at the time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said the agreement between the Ministry of Ayush and WHO to establish the Global Centre for Traditional Medicine (GCTM) - world's first - at Jamnagar, Gujarat, is a commendable initiative. He laid the foundation stone of WHO-GCTM in Jamnagar in April 2022. Speaking on the occasion, Modi had said that the WHO-GCTM is recognition of India's contribution and potential in this field. \"India's traditional medicine system is not limited only to treatment. It is a holistic science of life. India takes this partnership as a huge responsibility for serving the entire humanity.” WHO had convened the Traditional Medicine Global Summit in August last year in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. The summit was co-hosted by India, which held the G20 presidency in 2023. It was held alongside the G20 Health Ministerial meeting. The summit explored the role of traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine in addressing pressing health challenges and driving progress in global health and sustainable development. Ghebreyesus had arrived in Gujarat to attend the global summit on traditional medicine and was accorded a warm welcome. Praising India for its \"rich history\" of traditional medicine like Ayurveda and yoga, Ghebreyesus had stressed the need to integrate this ancient medicinal knowledge into the national health system of countries. \"India has a rich history of traditional medicine through Ayurveda, including yoga, which has been shown to be effective in alleviating pain. The Gujarat Declaration, the main outcome of this summit, will focus on integration of traditional medicines in national health systems, and help unlock the power of traditional medicine through science,\" the WHO chief had said. In his address to the World Health Assembly Monday, Ghebreyesus said 2023 was a year of many challenges, but also of many achievements. He said the year 2023 was a productive one in WHO's work supporting access to medicines and other health products. \"We prequalified 120 medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and other products last year for HIV, malaria, multidrug-resistant TB, Ebola, polio and Covid-19, as well as the first long-acting insulin analogues,” he said. He noted that one of the biggest disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic was to routine immunization programmes in many countries, resulting in backsliding coverage and outbreaks of measles, diphtheria, polio, yellow fever and more. \"In April last year, we launched 'The Big Catch Up' with UNICEF and Gavi, to support countries to shut down outbreaks and restore immunization programmes at least to pre-pandemic levels,” he said. In May last year, the WHO chief had declared an end to both Covid-19 and mpox as global health emergencies. “We continue to call on all countries to maintain and reinforce the capacities for surveillance, detection and response that they built during the pandemic. These investments must not go to waste.” © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd First uploaded on: 28-05-2024 at 00:30 IST Here’s Your Exclusive Pass To Premium Stories CLAIM NOW Deepak Tijori on not asking Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan for help Entertainment May 16, 2024 08:01 IST Deepak Tijori, a veteran actor and filmmaker, spoke about his 30-year journey in the industry and the challenges faced by independent producers.

        "content": "After suffering his earliest-ever defeat at the French Open, a tournament he has won a record 14 times, Rafael Nadal said it is unlikely for him to play at Wimbledon next month, even as he eyes a chance to turn out at the Olympics, taking place at his beloved Roland Garros later this year, one last time. “I can’t confirm anything, but I don’t think it’s smart (to play Wimbledon) after everything my body has been through,” he was quoted as saying by AFP at his post-match press conference. “It will be difficult playing on grass, considering that right after Wimbledon are the Olympic Games.” Nadal, hoping to be competitive in his first round against an in-form opponent, showed invariable signs of rustiness after playing only 15 matches since the start of 2023. He bowed out 3-6, 6-7(5), 3-6 to in-form fourth seed Alexander Zverev. The Spaniard was competitive, especially in the second set which he served for before slumping in the tie-breaker, but Zverev’s shotmaking, fitness and power proved too much to handle. Advertisement READ | French Open: Clay god Rafael Nadal’s exit starts end of unprecedented Roland Garros stronghold Nadal said his body had been through the wringer in recent times. “My body has been a jungle for two years. It has been a big fight, waking up as if a snake or a tiger had bitten me. I need to prepare myself and clear my ideas about a calendar. My main goal is to prepare for the Olympics and to prepare well to be healthy here,” he said, per tennismajors.com, at the press conference. The soon-to-be-38-year-old said he takes positives from Monday’s loss to the German. “My feeling is that I wasn’t that far. I was at a good level (in the match),” Nadal added. “If it was the last time I played here, I would be at peace with myself. I tried to do everything I could to play here. At least I did. Even if I lost, that’s part of the business... I don’t know what’s going to happen in the next few months.” Nadal also had the unusual experience of being watched by active players, in competition at the French Open this year, who were in attendance at Court Philippe Chatrier to bear witness to his potentially final outing. “Happy that it happens, it means that I have a positive legacy here,” he said.",

        "content": "The Maharashtra government will not proceed with all the recommendations from the recently proposed Maharashtra State Curriculum Framework for School Education, said State Education Minister Deepak Kesarkar. The framework had stirred a controversy for using lines from Manusmriti as reference in one of the chapters in the draft, a move that Kesarkar clarified had not received governmental or the steering committee’s approval before being made public. Speaking at a press conference in Mumbai on Thursday, Kesarkar expressed regret in excluding Marathi as a compulsory language. “It happened because the draft was made public without following the proper procedure,” he said. Advertisement Kesarkar also said that the exclusion of English as a compulsory language for Class 11 and 12 was “because the government is working to offer higher education in regional languages, including technical education”. After the minister’s clarification, the SCERT issued a press release late Monday stating that Marathi and English language would be compulsory from Class 1 to 10. It also clarified that Hindi, Sanskrit and other Indian and foreign languages are being offered from Class 6, while Classes 11 and 12 students will have to learn two languages — one Indian and the other foreign. Last week, the State Council of Educational Research and Training unveiled the new Maharashtra State Curriculum Framework (SCF), advocating the integration of Indian Knowledge System (IKS) into School Education (SE). It proposed including texts such as the Bhagavad Gita and Manache Shlok — a composition by Samarth Ramdas Swami — for memorisation enhancement through recitation competitions. A chapter on “value education and disposition” from SCF, which aimed at character-building for students, sparked controversy as it began with a Sanskrit verse from Manusmriti, an ancient Hindu legal text describing the social system. This inclusion drew criticism from various quarters regarding the intent behind the decision. Advertisement Kesarkar addressed the issue, stating, “It was an error on the part of the steering committee that placed the draft in public domain without state government approval. The people involved have expressed regret for this. Let me make it clear, the government does not want to propagate any text and will not include any of this in textbooks.” After the matter came to light, several educationists questioned the decision to the Manusmriti reference. “There are numerous Sanskrit verses conveying similar meanings, yet the draft selects one from Manusmriti. This decision appears either politically naive or intentionally provocative, potentially offending certain segments of the society,” said a renowned educationist. While language policy for Classes 3 to 10 lacked clarity; for Classes 11 and 12, English was categorised as foreign language. Chhagan Bhujbal, Maharashtra Cabinet Minister, also expressed concerns, saying the inclusion of Manusmriti in the curriculum could send a wrong signal among Dalits and OBCs. “Such actions could impact us electorally. This initiative must be halted. Though seemingly insignificant now, it could pose future challenges,” Bhujbal said.",

        "content": "The Bombay High Court on Monday asked CIDCO to stall its move to remove the hoarding concerned and instead suggested they come up with a policy or regime for hoardings located within their jurisdiction or area. The court was hearing a plea by advertisement agencies challenging the notices issued by City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) to remove alleged illegal hoardings in Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area (NAINA). A vacation bench of Justices NR Borkar and Somasekhar Sundaresan also remarked that civic authorities said nothing to the advertising firms until the Ghatkopar hoarding collapse incident. Firms including Devangi Outdoor Advertising and Harmesh Dilip Tanna, proprietor of Gargee Graphics, had approached the High Court stating that CIDCO did not have the jurisdiction to send such notices. The petitioners claimed they had erected the hoardings legally after obtaining necessary permissions from authorities. Advertisement Despite this, they said they have received notices for removal of hoardings within 24 hours or face action under Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act (MRTP). As per petitioners, the authorities have warned them that if hoardings were not removed, they would dismantle them and recover costs from the owner. The notices by CIDCO come in wake of the collapse of a hoarding on a petrol pump in Ghatkopar on May 13, which killed 17 people. CIDCO purportedly issued notices to several hoarding owners after the unfortunate incident. Advocate for the petitioner firms, Mohsin Khan, argued that the notices were issued without a show-cause notice, which violated the principles of natural justice. Khan also claimed that authorities failed to verify the structural stability of the hoardings before issuing the notice, hence the action amounted to being arbitrary and ex-facie illegal. However, CIDCO’s lawyer submitted that the authority had issued notices to several owners of hoardings after discovering they had been installed without requisite permissions. The lawyer claimed that the same exercise was crucial as it was within the Navi Mumbai airport region. The corporation also claimed that the hoardings erected since 2018–19 had applied for permission in 2023, including those by the petitioners. Advertisement The bench sought to know if the authority had conducted any structural audit of all hoardings within its domain, and whether the authority was planning to bring a regime or policy in place for illegal hoardings within its area. These hoardings are not brought back to CIDCO, the bench said, and until the Ghatkopar incident, nobody said anything. In these circumstances, the bench asked if the corporation should at least not study whether the hoardings pose any danger, instead of bringing them down? “Have a reasonable policy view, otherwise case by case people will come. If you decide to demolish everything, that is also different. We are placing this on May 30. Till next date, if it is not pulled down, we are asking you to hold it,” the bench said.",

        "content": "The Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC ) commenced the Continuous Voter Registration exercise in Edo State on Monday. The exercise aims to capture would-be voters who have yet to register ahead of the governorship election in Edo on September 21. Naija News gathered that the CVR and the PVC collection would be a 10-day exercise from May 27 to June 5, 2024, from 9 am to 3 pm daily, including weekends. Despite a call from the state acting chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Jarret Tenebe, on Friday, to cancel the exercise due to the damage to its secretariat, materials, and equipment meant for CVR, it proceeded as scheduled. In response to the call, Edo INEC’s head of Voters Education and Publicity, Timidi Wariowei, expressed dissatisfaction, stating that it is unjust to accuse the electoral body in this manner. The CVR exercise, monitored in Oredo, Egor, and Ikpoba-Okha local governments, indicated that PVC collection was also progressing alongside the continuous voter registration exercise. At the registration site in Ikpoba-Okha, Rhoda Gumus, the INEC National Commissioner overseeing Edo, Delta, and Cross River, expressed contentment with the ongoing exercise and urged registrants to wait patiently as their registrations were processed. Gumus said, “ We have been to Oredo, and we are here at the Ikpoba-Okha registration area, which we are using as our state head office registration centre because of the flood disaster that happened at our head office on Friday. “We are in touch with other registration areas within and outside Benin, and the exercise is going on smoothly. As you can see, we have registered some people, and others are still waiting. The process just started today. It is impressive and commendable . “ The state Resident Electoral Commissioner, Anugbum Onuoha, affirmed that INEC was adequately prepared for the exercise, emphasizing that the flood disaster, which damaged some of the commission’s equipment, would not hinder the operation. Onuoha said, “ We thank God for the enablement to begin this exercise, having in mind the flood disaster that destroyed some of our equipment on Friday. Due to the flood disaster, we moved our head office registration area to the INEC office at Ikpoba-Okha local government. “We are here and witnessing a large turnout of people who are here as either new registrants or to transfer their registration or for PVC collection. INEC is prepared for this exercise and nothing will make us fail. People expected us to discontinue the exercise but we were prepared even before the flood disaster happened. “Yes, we had some initial network problems, but it has been resolved, and the exercise is going on smoothly, and by the grace of God, the exercise will be successful .”",

According to Sky Sport Italia and Calciomercato.com, Emerson’s agent and representatives from Milan held an ‘exploratory’ meeting to discuss the player’s availability ahead of the summer transfer window. It is understood that the Brazilian is set to leave Spurs over the next few months, and Milan, who are in the market for a right-back, have been now. The North London club are planning to continue with Pedro Porro as their first-choice right-back, which would leave Emerson with a lack of consistent first-team game time. He is still under contract in North London until 2026. Tottenham reportedly value the player in the region of €30m. He is, however, not the only right-back that Milan have been evaluating, according to .

        "content": "The Nigeria Police, Lagos State Command, has confirmed the arrest of an online blogger, identified as Stanley Okoruwa for allegedly defaming a businessman, Emeka Okonkwo, popularly known as “E-Money”. The suspect, who was paraded before newsmen on Monday, confessed to the crime and claimed to have used the offending video to boost his followership online. Okoruwa in the said video accused the businessman of having illicit affairs with the wife of the late Nollywood star, John Odonwodo, aka Junior Pope. He also accused the businessman of being responsible for the death of the late Nollywood star, who died in a boat accident. The spokesperson of the command, Benjamin Hundeyin, told newsmen that the suspect would be prosecuted for cyberbullying and defamation of character. ALSO READ: Junior Pope’s wife: E-money confirms arrest of ‘man who defamed him’ He said that the suspect was arrested in Uromi, Delta State, following a petition from the businessman. Hundeyin said, “He is going to be prosecuted because the things he engaged in were criminal in nature. He has allegedly defamed E-Money and he is going to be prosecuted. “We are not prosecuting the suspect because of the personality involved, but because he has allegedly committed a crime, the personality goes through the normal channel by reporting the case to the police and we investigated and arrested the suspect.” Hundeyin warned social media users against content that is injurious to other people’s personalities, stressing that action may be taken against them if reports of their content were found offensive by anyone. The suspect, while speaking with newsmen, said “I did a video about E-Money. I said a lot of things that are not true in that video, that is why the police arrested me.” He added, “I said something regarding a video I saw online about a woman – saying that Sir E-Money is responsible for the things that happened to Nollywood Actor, John Odonwodo, aka Junior Pope’s case. “I said something like that, I also said that Sir E-Money was also having an affair with Junior Pope’s wife. I have never in my life met E-Money. Everything I made in that video was not true.” Continuing, he said, ” I made the video out of trying to boost my page traffic level, I never knew it would go viral the way it went. I don’t have a bad intention to spoil Sir E-Money’s name. I was just making the video, I didn’t know it would go such wide.” “I know the contents of the video were wrong of me to have made. I don’t know the video will escalate to that extent,” the suspect added. Stanley stated, ” I saw that the video was already going viral, I thought pulling it down will not make sense. I decided to leave it. I have not reached out to E-Money to apologise, because I don’t have his contact to do so. “I was already planning to make an apology video, that was when I was arrested by the police. I have been praying to have this opportunity to apologize to him. I am very sorry Sir E-Money, I don’t mean to tarnish his image, I didn’t mean to spoil his name online.”",

        "content": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The police recreated the mayor-KSRTC driver feud according to the complaint about the KSRTC bus driver not allowing the Mayor’s car to pass through. The complaint also alleged that the driver showed obscene gestures at the family members. The trip was recreated four days ago to confirm the allegations against driver Yadhu. On the 25th, the police travelled from Plamoodu to PMG by driving a bus, followed by a car at the same time. The cantonment assistant commissioner confirmed receiving strong evidence to support the mayor's complaint. The police found that the person in the back seat of the car could see the driver making obscene gestures. The Cantonment Police had registered a case against Yadhu for insulting women. The Assistant Commissioner stated that it is customary to record mahazar in such cases. Apart from the mayor, her husband Sachin Dev MLA, Arya's brother and sister-in-law were also in the car. Their car, which was returning after the wedding reception, was not given space by the KSRTC bus. The mayor’s car then blocked the bus in front of the Palayam shopping complex and she alleged the driver of reckless driving and also making obscene gestures. Passengers stated that Sachin Dev boarded the bus during an argument with the bus driver. The conductor's trip sheet also says that Sachin boarded the bus. However, Sachin told the police that he did not board the bus and did not disrupt the service.",

        "content": "PARIS Hilton has shown off her growing babies while on a family vacation in Hawai'i. The reality star and socialite was joined by her rarely seen brother, Barron, and his own wife and kids. Paris and Barron reunited for a relaxing vacation at the Grand Wailea resort in Maui . The 43-year-old shared a series of photos and videos from her trip to her Instagram. Paris smiled as she relaxed on a pink bed, in pink loungewear, while cuddling with her kids . She shares two children with husband Carter Reum - a son named Phoenix and a daughter London . She is also step-mom to Carter's older daughter, Evie, from his previous relationship with Laura Bellizzi. Joining them on the trip, and appearing in a family photo, was brother Barron, his wife, Tessa, and their kids. \"Reliving my childhood and carrying on our family vacation tradition at the @GrandWailea with my beautiful family,\" Paris captioned the collection. In the comments section, fans lauded the hotel heiress and her children. \"Most beautiful family,\" one person commented, as another echoed, \"I cannot handle the cuteness.\" \"Being a mom is by far your greatest look,\" a third noted. While a fourth gushed, \"London is SO CUTE!!!! I don’t have enough available brain cells to process.\" As one person complimented, \"I am so happy for Paris because she got everything she ever wished for.\" Paris better enjoy her vacations while she can, because she will soon be getting back to work on a new reality show. Being a mom is by far your greatest look.\" And she'll do so with Nicole Richie , 42, more than 20 years after their first paired outing. The iconic duo previously worked together from 2003 to 2007 on The Simple Life . Paris teased her reality return on Instagram, posting a video of a classic television broadcasting static noise. Suddenly, Paris and Nicole's voices could be heard singing, and then yelling their personal theme song, Sanasa. \"New Era. Same Besties,\" she captioned. \"Coming soon to Peacock.\" Earlier this month, Paris and Nicole teased something was in the works when they posted a collage of different milestone events throughout their friendship, including early 2000s selfies and childhood snaps. \"From Day 1: Sill and Bill,\" they captioned their posts, referring to the nicknames they gave one another on The Simple Life. Once the news was official , fans online went wild. \"A pop culture renaissance!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" one person exclaimed. \"The OGs of reality show!!\" another declared. \"The real celebrities we love!! Yaaaas!! Can’t wait queens. \"So f**king excited!,\" a third added. \"I have no words but Slivin. That’s Hot!\" Paris and Nicole became household names, and punchlines, nearly two decades ago, as their reality show, The Simple Life followed the two high-end celebs experiencing life outside their bubble by working low-paying jobs . The first season aired in 2003, and documented Paris and Nicole's one-month stay in Arkansas with a farm family. A year later, the besties headed out in a pink pickup truck where they participated in many different jobs, including fishing and working as maids, for Season 2. During Season 3, the iconic duo worked several different internships across the United States , and in Season 4, they took on the role of being wives in a family. In the final season, Paris and Nicole worked at a summer camp as counselors.",

Tom is currently on his own in the village due to Belle ( Eden Taylor-Draper ) spending time in a mental health unit. This development happened last week, when Belle spoke to a nurse and said she knows her mental health is struggling, and is worried about what may happen next. We know that Belle’s difficulties with her mental health are being exacerbated as a result of Tom’s abusive behaviour. During Tom’s latest plan of making it seem as though Belle was the one with anger problems, he wound her up so much, Belle pushed him to the floor in front of Rhona (Zoe Henry), Marlon (Mark Charnock) and Vanessa ( Michelle Hardwick ).

In tonight’s episode of the ITV soap, Tom spent time with Lydia (Karen Blick). As they chatted about Belle, Tom learnt that his wife had asked Lydia to visit her. Lydia tried to tell Tom that Belle probably didn’t want him to see her in a dark place. Out of control, Tom had to come up with another plan – and it was horrific.

        "content": "Belle Dingle ( Eden Taylor-Draper ) had a meeting with her therapist in Monday’s (May 27) episode of Emmerdale. Last week, Belle decided to check into a mental health unit. As a result of Tom’s ( James Chase ) abusive behaviour, poor Belle is now struggling and decided time away from the village would be safer for her. Watching Belle drive away was challenging for Tom – and not because he found it difficult to see his wife in a dark place. All alone and surrounded by professionals who want to help her, Belle could end up telling someone about her abusive relationship – and an out of control Tom knew he had to do something about it. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a webbrowser that supports HTML5video Unable to visit Belle because she asked Lydia (Karen Blick) to see her instead, Tom developed a plan in the hope his wife would return home – and it involved poisoning Piper the dog. Meanwhile, in the mental health unit, Belle was speaking with her therapist. Belle started the session feeling a little puzzled. She said how in the past, when she experienced problems with her mental health, she would hear voices in her head – and that isn’t happening this time. Continuing to open up, it became apparent that Belle believed every recent thing she’d been through with Tom were all her fault. She said she makes Tom feel like he isn’t good enough and thought he had to prove himself just so they could share a house together.

        "content": "It’s been confirmed that Ruby Fox-Miligan ( Beth Cordingly ) and Rose Jackson (Christine Tremarco) are working together in Emmerdale to destroy Kim Tate ( Claire King ). Up until Monday’s (May 27) episode, we’ve known Rose as simply Dawn’s ( Olivia Bromley ) estranged mother – and someone who is annoying Kim a great deal. All she’s been doing for the past few weeks is trying to develop a connection with Dawn and enjoying Kim’s posh drinks tray – but it seems that’s all set to change from here on in. After a brief interaction between Rose and Ruby in the pub, which established they know each other somehow, they then met up at the graveyard. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a webbrowser that supports HTML5video Rose alluded to the fact she didn’t want to be a part of Ruby’s plan anymore, because Dawn’s son Evan is poorly and it was making her feel terrible. Ruby told her friend that once their revenge is complete, she’ll be able to be a mum to Dawn – something she’s always wanted. So, what’s the plan? Split Kim and Will (Dean Andrews) up, let Ruby take Home Farm (something Caleb (William Ash) believes belongs to them anyway) and allow Rose to emotionally support Dawn when everything falls apart. It appears Ruby has been secretly developing quite the plot on behalf of her husband, who’s own plan to destroy Kim Tate failed spectacularly last year. But will it work this time?

        "content": "Sport | Football Transfer news LIVE! Arsenal are keen to strengthen in attack, as they prepare for another busy summer transfer window. The Gunners are reportedly in a battle with Bayern Munich and Barcelona for £43m-rated Nico Williams, while Newcastle star Alexander Isak has been linked too. It is also claimed they will contend too with Tottenham and Manchester United for French starlet Desire Doue. United are eyeing defensive reinforcements, with Chelsea ’s Levi Colwill said to be on the shortlist. Chelsea are hoping to sign both Crystal Palace winger Michael Olise and Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford, though need a new manager first as they close in on top target Enzo Maresca of Leicester in the race to succeed Mauricio Pochettino, who, along with Thomas Frank, has been sounded out to potentially replace Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford with a decision over the Dutchman’s future expected this week following an end-of-season review. Kieran McKenna is now understood to be out of the race , but Roberto De Zerbi is an option. Tottenham are said to be lining up the likes of Ivan Toney, Jarrad Branthwaite and Evanilson as part of ambitious summer plans, while Liverpool could look to make either Leny Yoro or Leeds winger Crysencio Summerville their first signing under new boss Arne Slot. Follow all the latest transfer news, rumours and gossip live below! Latest transfer news and rumours Live updates Ivan Toney is available for between £30-40million this summer. That’s according to TEAMtalk, with it claimed that Brentford have been forced to lower their valuation as the striker enters the final 12 months of his contract. Ange Postecoglou is believed to have urged Tottenham to sign a striker this window, with Toney high on the wishlist, and a reduced asking price has significantly improved Spurs’ hopes of getting their man. Barcelona and Bayern Munich are among the clubs interested in a summer move for Nico Williams. Recent reports have suggested Arsenal are very keen on the 21-year-old, who plays for Athletic Bilbao and is believed to have a release clause of around £43m. However, according to Relevo, Bayern are eyeing Williams and will monitor him at the Euros, while Barcelona have long admired the winger. Levi Colwill is among the centre-backs being considered by Manchester United. The Daily Star claim that United are refusing to meet Everton’s £80m asking price for Jarrad Branthwaite, and will be on if it is not lowered to around £60m. It’s suggested that other targets being lined up are Chelsea’s Colwill, Marc Guehi and Juventus defender Gleison Bremer. One manager not on the move this summer is Unai Emery. The Aston Villa boss has signed a new five-year contract, after leading the club into the Champions League. His time in England with Arsenal didn’t work out, but Emery is evidently loving life at Villa, committing his future through to 2029. Sofyan Amrabat has indicated that he could yet stay at Manchester United this summer. The Moroccan midfielder has endured a difficult season-long loan spell at Old Trafford from Serie A side Fiorentina, starting only 10 matches in the Premier League and limited to a lot of substitute cameos under Erik ten Hag. However, Amrabat’s influence grew as he showed signs of improvement during the final stages of the season, starting the last three Premier League matches and also Saturday’s surprise 2-1 victory over champions Manchester City in a memorable FA Cup final triumph at Wembley that guaranteed Europa League qualification for next term. Amrabat’s previous struggles to convince during a season that resulted in an eighth-place Premier League finish - their worst league position for 34 years - had led many to believe that there was very little chance of United exercising their €25million (£21m) option to sign him on a permanent basis this summer, having already spent €10m (£8m) on the initial loan deal. However, his recent resurgence could have changed minds. \"Do I already know what I’m going to do next year? No. We are going to talk,\" he told Dutch outlet Ziggo Sport. \"Staying is certainly an option. Look, I think it has been a very difficult season. For Manchester United it needs to be much better, and also for me personally.\" Read more on that here! The manager fun continues... Graham Potter has been out of management since he was sacked by Chelsea, after what proved to be a disastrous move from Brighton. The Guardian report that Potter is now in contention for a Premier League return... with Brighton. The Seagulls are on the hunt for a new manager after Roberto De Zerbi’s departure, and Potter is being considered Kieran McKenna is increasingly likely to remain at Ipswich. The Athletic report that McKenna is now expected to sign a long-term contract, ensuring he will lead the club in the Premier League next season. Chelsea have already moved on, but McKenna was still a target for Manchester United and Brighton. Newcastle are considering a move for Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford. Recent reports have suggested Chelsea are keen on Trafford, who was recently named in England’s pre-Euro 2024 training squad and is believed to be valued at around £20m. However, the Mail report that Newcastle are also now considering a move, after refusing to meet Arsenal’s £30m asking price for Aaron Ramsdale. Kevin De Bruyne, Ederson and Bernardo Silva all face uncertain futures at Manchester City. The Times report that Ederson and De Bruyne are both attracting interest from clubs in Saudi Arabia. Ederson in particular could be persuaded to make the move, it is suggested, while De Bruyne is a target as he enters the final 12 months of his current contract. Silva will be allowed to leave this summer if City receive a £50m offer. PSG and Barcelona are both keen, but the Spanish side are unlikely to be able to afford the fee. Over to the latest on Manchester United’s managerial situation now. We know that Erik ten Hag’s Old Trafford future will be determined this week during an end-of-season review by the club, with speculation that he is still likely to be removed despite Saturday’s FA Cup success at Wembley making it an obviously more difficult decision. However, the Manchester Evening News now report that United are actually considering keeping Ten Hag for next season, informing the representatives of potential new managerial candidates that they have not ruled out retaining their current boss. Ten Hag has one year left to run on the three-year contract he signed after swapping Ajax for United in the summer of 2022, with the Red Devils possessing the option to trigger a further 12 months beyond that. The plot thickens... Have your say...",

        "content": "A kitchen fire that broke out over the weekend has forced the closure of a popular Clinton Township diner. The fire at Ken’s Country Kitchen in the Amore Plaza shopping center on Hayes Road was reported after 3 p.m. Sunday, a short time after the employees had left the building for the day, the owner says. Zef Camaj, who co-owns the restaurant with Alex Gjelaj, said before workers left, they had thoroughly cleaned the kitchen. He suspects one worker may have accidentally knocked a pilot on a grill, which eventually sparked the blaze. “The thing is, we recently completed a remodeling of the building, completely revamped it,” Camaj said. “We couldn’t make it better than it was.” Clinton Township Fire Department administrators were not available to comment Monday because of the holiday. The diner was known for its breakfast dishes, Camaj said. Ken’s Country Kitchen was a consistent winner in the Macomb Daily’s annual reader’s choice contest, and had also won similar contests with the Detroit Free Press and WDIV-TV (Channel 4). “The lucky part is, no one was inside when this happened, so nobody was injured. We are happy about that,” Camaj added. Ken’s Country Kitchen had originally opened in the 1990s at the Clinton Township location. In recent years, the partner decided to venture out to the northern part of the county, and opened one on Main Street, north of Division Road (32 Mile Road) in Richmond. The owners say they are offering some of the 20 employees work at the Richmond location until the Clinton Township one is refurbished. When that will be obviously isn’t known at this point. The eatery must deal with its insurance carrier on the damage and related details before it can plan on repairing the facility. “Hello, we will be closed until further notice,” the owner posted on his Facebook page. “We will keep you updated as soon as we know more details.” Camaj also urges Clinton Township customers to drive out to Richmond to enjoy the home cooking they have come to enjoy. “I can tell you this: We will reopen and when we do, we will be better than ever,” he said.",

        "content": "The move by the National Assembly to replace the current national anthem with the former one through an expeditious legislative process suffered a setback on Monday. Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi, who attended a public hearing on the matter organized by the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, warned that the issue of the National Anthem, should not be treated with legislative fiat. He said as commendable as the move by both Chambers of the National Assembly may be, enacting a law on National Anthem or replacing the current with the old demands that, Nigerians are carried along. Fagbemi said: “In some cases, national anthem emerges from open national competition among interested citizens. In other instances, the proposed national anthem is subjected to plebiscite or referendum, before its eventual adoption or declaration. He argued that “The essence of the foregoing is to secure the buy-in and confidence of the people and to ensure that the anthem meets their collective aspirations and suits their contemporary socio-political conditions.” “Against the background of the foregoing, I am of the considered opinion that the revered issue of choice of a national item should not come into being only by legislative fiat, or presidential proclamation alone. According to him, “the decision to change Nigeria’s National Anthem whether by replacing it with the old one or a new one, should be subjected to a wider process of citizen participation through zonal public hearings, resolutions of the Federal Executive Council, Council of State, National and State Assemblies, etc. “The outcome of this process is bound to be a true reflection of the wishes of the generality or majority of Nigerians.” Former minority leader of the Senate, Eyinnaya Abaribe, said he was totally against the move because the second stanza of the National Anthem is the country’s national prayer. He also revealed that his senatorial district was totally against the move, as there are more pressing issues that require the attention of the Federal Government. He said: “While we support the efforts of the Federal Government under President Bola A. Tinubu to ameliorate the difficulties that Nigerians face today of biting inflation, crippling unemployment and widespread insecurity, we do not feel that it is a priority to embark on a homegrown National Anthem 46 years after its adoption by Nigerians. “The reasons given for such unseemly haste to revert back to the colonial era anthem ark rather nebulous and mostly self-serving. “Reverting to an anthem that harks back to our troubled past as a nation does not enhance unity. Rather it reminds us all of nomenclatures such as ‘Tribes, Tongues’, Natives’ which divides us as a nation and which led to the unfortunate civil war. “The present anthem has a second stanza that is used as our National Prayer. Thus, going back to the old anthem will make the nation be put even further apart as it will mean we will not have a National Prayer. The lawmaker contended that the present National Anthem was accompanied by a pledge which all children and patriots recite at official functions. “Will reverting back to the old anthem not mean abrogation of the pledge since they go together? He queried. “The peoples of Abia South Senatorial District are desirous of policies and plans to reduce the pump price of petrol from the present 1.000 naira per litre in Aba, the 224 naira per kWh of electricity, the more than 100% increase in food prices than going back to an anthem written by a colonial citizen of Britain and bequeathed to Nigerians at our independence in 1960. Therefore, the people of Abia South Senatorial District in their entirety reject the bill to revert back to the old anthem.” In his submission at the public hearing , the Minister of Information and National Orientation, Alhaji Mohammed Idris Malagi, recommended that the scope should be expanded to include a robust issue on national identity rather than limiting it to change of national anthem. The Minister who was represented by the Director-General of National Orientation Agency ( NOA) , Mr Lanre Issa-Onilu, noted that some lines in the old national anthem does not make a complete meaning. “The issue of national anthem is just a sub-sect. What we should be looking at is the National Identity Act. “The challenge we have today is that we do not have a value national identity which the national anthem is one of them. It is not about singing in schools, it is about learning it and imbibing it.” Also cautioning the National Assembly on expeditious passage of the bill, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), called for wider consultations for Nigerians to accept whatever National Anthem is proposed and buy into it . According to him, the National Assembly should widen the scope of participation in the process of coming up with such an Act for general acceptability . He however supported the move to replace the current “Arise O Compatriots National Anthem” with the “Nigeria, We Hail Thee”, the country started with, in October 1960. He said such a move was long overdue since the current National Anthem adopted in 1978 , does not have the required gravitas and not inspirational to fire the passion and zeal for Nationhood among Nigerians. Nigeria, according to him, will not be the first country in the world to replace current National Anthem with the old one as over 20 countries like Russia, Austria, Chile, France, Saudi Arabia, China, Brazil, Iran, Iraq etc, have done so at different times in the past.

        "content": "Was Johnny Wactor Married? Wife, Family Details and Cause of Death Revealed By Johnny Wactor’s death has left many deeply shocked. The talented actor was most well known for his role in General Hospital and many fans are curious about the actor’s personal life in the wake of his sudden death. Here are all the details of his personal life and what happened to him. Did Johnny Wactor have a wife? No, John Wactor wasn’t married and didn’t have a wife. Wactor had always kept his personal life away from the public eye, making fans curious whether he was in a relationship or not. As per , in 2022, he was allegedly linked with Kaitlin Sullivan, following their posted close moments on his social media handle. The two never openly confirmed their low-key relationship. Their shared images also now seem to be deleted, indicating that they might have parted ways earlier. Moreover, it was reportedly known that he was single and was focused on his acting career before his untimely death. Johnny Wactor cause of death As per , Johnny Wactor died when he was shot by one of the three suspects who came to rob a vehicle’s catalytic converter on Saturday near Pica Boulevard and Hope Street. Wactor’s mother Scarlett spoke with and gave out details on what happened to her son. She revealed that he and his co-worker were returning from their bartending duties at a rooftop bar around 3 am or 3:30 am. That’s when they saw three men whom he thought were towing his car. However, when Wactor interrupted them, a masked man shot him. Wactor was quickly taken to a local hospital. However, it was too late by then and he didn’t survive. Johnny Wactor’s death was confirmed by his agent David Shaul in an official statement, released by Variety, where he shared his kind words. “Johnny Wactor was a spectacular human being. Not just a talented actor who was committed to his craft but a real moral example to everyone who knew him. Standing for hard work, tenacity and a never give up attitude. In the highs and lows of a challenging profession he always kept his chin up and kept striving for the best he could be. Our time with Johnny was a privilege we would wish on everyone. He would literally give you the shirt off his back. After over a decade together, he will leave a hole in our hearts forever,” Shaul said. The police have opened an investigation and are on the search for the three suspects, who ran away from the crime scene. Shazmeen is a writer, entertainment journalist, and movie aficionado at core. She holds a degree in multimedia and mass communication, specializing in advertising, but her ardor for cinema led her into entertainment journalism. While her cinematic preferences know no bounds, she specifically has fondness for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, psychological thrillers, horror, and films with profound philosophical undertones.

        "content": "The executives of Esa-Oke Central Union in Osun State on Monday donated a generating set to the town maternity centre. The union also commissioned a renovated toilet for market women and cleared an eight-kilometre abandoned Imesi to Esa-Oke road. Speaking during the inauguration and swearing-in ceremony of executives, the union chairman, Gbamigboye Aremu said the gesture was to ease the affairs of the residents of the town. He said, “The reason why we donated the generating set was due to the complaint by those working in the maternity centre that they don’t usually get light during the delivery of pregnant women. “After the complaints, we the executives of the union tasked ourselves and get the generator for the maternity to aid their service delivery. “Also, the leadership of the market women came to us that they needed us to renovate their toilets for convenience which we also do. “We also cleared the bushy portion of Imesi to Esa-Oke road which has been abandoned by road users. Motorists are scared to pass the road for fear of being kidnapped but now, we have cleared the road and expanded it and our people can make use of it now.” Aremu appealed to the leadership of the community maternity centre and market to make proper use of the donated equipment and toilet. “I want to appeal to the beneficiaries to make proper use of the donated equipment. We have done our part and we are still aiming to do more but they also have to maintain those things judiciously .” The monarch of the town, Adeyemi Adediran, appreciated the union for their kind gesture, calling on sons and daughters of the community to always give back to their community.

        "content": "THE Blue Kumuls and FC Genesis clashed in a thrilling encounter that showcased the best of their skills, with both teams refusing to yield in the Port Moresby soccer association men’s premier division match on Saturday. In the end, they had to settle for a hard-fought draw, leaving both sets of fans eagerly anticipating their next showdown. Both teams wasted no time when five minutes from kickoff, Blue Kumuls were awarded a free kick just outside the penalty box. Hans Tapio (15) unleashed a powerful shot that ricocheted off the crossbar. After that, Genesis upped the ante, launching a sustained attack that yielded two successive corner kicks. Unfortunately, they couldn’t capitalise on the opportunities. Play continued in Genesis half of the field with Blue Kumuls midfield team of Steven Inia and Tapio probing the Genesis defence when a sneak pass found Jordan Kaven (11) who shot from within the box right on the 18th minute for Blue Kumuls to lead 1-0. A scramble in the Blue Kumul’s penalty box ten minutes later found Genesis number 16 Ezekiel Vela with a loose ball that he calmly pushed past keeper Baniau to level the scores at 1-1. The game’s intensity increased with the occasional push and shove that drew a couple of yellow cards to both sides. Blue Kumuls Inia occasionally tried using wide balls but was cut off by the defence of Nathan Togs and his company of youthful defenders for Genesis. Three minutes to half-time Genesis number 4, Stanley Kila picked up a missed ball by a Blue Kumuls defender only to miss what could have been the easiest of goals. Genesis came back in the second half all fired up with right winger Kaniyosi making his usual runs let loose a shot that hit the left post much to the delight of the supporters on the sidelines. Midfielders led by Benjamin Kila continued with their threatening runs into Blue Kumuls territory but the strikers time and again could not find the mark with their shots. Number 16 Vela made several attempts at goal but most were wide also. Niebo and Ara also made attempts for Genesis without much success. Ten minutes later a clearance header from a corner to Steven Inia found henchman Tapio who shot unchallenged from the edge of the box to just tip the crossbar. That miss brought deafening sighs to the Blue Kumuls supporters. Inia continued with his through balls when a pass landed in front of teammate Steven Giwibing (2) who fumbled right in the box much to the dismay of the sighing supporters. A minute to time Steven Inia was assisted off-field with an injury with the scores remaining at one all until full-time. Marty Terry of Blue Kumuls commented saying: “ We had our chances but could not finish off well. “And yes both teams played well also’’ Genesis’s Emmanuel Liosi said: “Blue Kumuls is a respected team in the premier division and when you play them you take them seriously. “Yes our youthful team did their best but we did miss a lot of chances also.”",

        "content": "The caravan, which Mr Browne admits he acquired for €1,600 just four weeks ago, was to be intended as a cost-effective alternative to B&Bs and hotels Reporter: Reporter 27 May 2024 7:15 PM A 71-year-old security guard, William Browne, was shocked to discover his caravan, purchased a month prior, was missing from his property after returning from his early morning shift. Speaking to Joe Duffy on RTÉ's Liveline, William, who starts work in Dublin at 5am, was informed one morning last week by his daughter at approximately 10am that the caravan had been taken. It was confirmed that South Dublin County Council's Environmental team removed the caravan following several complaints from local residents. The caravan, which William admits he acquired for €1,600 just four weeks ago, was to be intended as a cost-effective alternative to B&Bs and hotels. Originally from Wexford, now living in Clondalkin, he said that he had planned to use the caravan for visits home, especially during summer when relatives come to visit. Despite words from council staff that the caravan was not an issue as long as it was unoccupied, William was surprised by the action taken against him. It is said that a notice citing the Housing Miscellaneous Provisions Act required him to remove the \"temporary dwelling\" within one day, with warnings of a €1,270 fine. The caravan, which they joked was something from 'Father Ted,' was on a grassy spot until it was seized. \"There's an patch of grass, westbound, at the side of my house and there's surveillance there on the wall, and that's where the carvan was,\" said William. Later, Joe responded: \" What did they think you were doing? Setting up a halting site or something.\" After calling the council's environmental office after receiving a letter regarding the caravan, William received no answer so took to visit the Tallaght-based office. It said that the situation remains unresolved, and the caravan is still seized. William, who also owns a small boat and a jeep which can pull the caravan, was disappointed over the council’s actions. Given previous health struggles which he detailed on the show, including past heart surgery, a stroke, diabetes, and chronic asthma, William told Joe of his worries on his health regarding the stress of the ordeal. South Dublin County Council have been contacted for comment on the matter, but had not replied at time of publication.",

        "content": "Katie Price shared a post detailing 'five reasons the narcissist hates you' months after her split from Carl Woods. The former glamour model, who is currently dating Married At First Sight UK star JJ Slater, was previously engaged to Love Island star Carl. The duo were in an on-ff relationship since they first started dating in 2020. They were believed to have split up again in November last year but sparked reconciliation rumours the following month when they were seen together . Not long after, Katie was seen enjoying cosy nights out with JJ before confirming their relationship on social media. Katie, who doesn't shy away from sharing cryptic posts about her exes, recently took to her social media to share a post about narcissism on her Stories. The post read: \"Five reasons the narcissist hates you: 1. You've stopped falling for their lies 2. They've lost the control they once had over you 3. You've cracked their facade and see them for who they really are 4. You're no longer desperate for their approval 5. Their schemes and tricks don't work on you anymore.\" Katie shared a new post about narcissism on her page ( Image: Instagram/ @katieprice) The duo, who were in an on-off relationship for a few years, split last year ( Image: Getty Images) Back in February, Carl made a few digs about the split as he praised himself for getting himself through the tough period. Carl vowed to keep a 'low profile' and focus on himself after the breakup. Taking to his Instagram stories, the former Love Island star made a number of digs at his ex-fiancée. In one story post, Carl showed off his adorable new puppy as he joked that his new pet pooch was 'doing his head in'. However, he also commended his dog's immense 'loyalty' as he said it was the 'most important thing'. In another story, Carl re-shared an inspirational video which said: \"God knows when to send you exactly what you need. Being private, staying low-key, and not telling everyone everything is self-care. Seek respect, not attention.\" Carl then appeared to reference his split with Katie as he re-shared yet another inspirational video. \"I love you enough to let you go,\" the video started. \"Go find that person that you say is better than me. Everything hurts when you love somebody. I love for real.\" Meanwhile, Carl and Katie's other ex Kieran Hayler united at Silver Leas Polo in Hertfordshire and looked all smiles as they shared a video of their outing on social media. However, one of their mutual pals present couldn't help but point out the meeting was \"awkward\", while jokingly putting a hand to their mouth as the camera panned around. This isn't the first time Kieran and Carl spend time together as they previously celebrated Easter Sunday as a duo - which allegedly left their famous ex furious.

        "content": "Lionel Messi’s annual salary he receives from Inter Miami has been revealed by the press sources. Lionel Messi gets $20.45 million annual net salary from Inter Miami, making him the highest paid player in the American League, according to The Guardian . This is ahead of the whole clubs which do not pay this much amount to their full-player rosters. With $12 million as a basic salary, in addition to various bonuses, the Argentine player joined Inter Miami. As Messi earned 138 million euros in one season during his last contract with Barcelona in 2017, the Argentine player’s salary at Inter Miami does not appear to be the best in his football career. Messi’s Barcelona salary had a value that included more salaries and bonuses before he moved to Paris Saint-Germain in 2021. With a contract extending until the end of 2025, Lionel Messi became part of Inter Miami in July of last year. Moreover, he rejected the idea of ​​​​leaving for the Saudi League, after receiving an astronomical offer from Crescent Moon.",

        "content": "JEOPARDY! has been bashed by fans for overturning an incorrect answer. Fans of the game show said that the contestant's answer was not the same as what the answer was and said host Ken Jennings should have asked him to clarify. Amar Kakirde chose the category \"Date of Birth\" for $400 on the May 24 episode. The question read, \"Jan. 3, 2009, with the mining of the Genesis block.\" Amar's contestant, Has, buzzed in with \"Minecraft,\" which was wrong. Then, Amar buzzed in and said, \"Blockchain.\" \"Also, incorrect,\" Ken, 50, said. Anna Marie did not buzz in by the time the buzzer went off. Ken revealed the answer to be Bitcoin. The game went on as usual and the contestants moved on to different categories. However, when Jeopardy! came back from a commercial break, Ken made an announcement before they continued on with the game. \"First off, we have a little surprise for Amar that does not involve rats or crabs,\" he said. \"Our judges have decided to accept his response of the Blockchain, so that's going to add $800 to his score.\" This pushed Amar into the lead with $4,500. Amar nodded with a slight smile on his face before they started the next round. Although both Bitcoin and Blockchain were invented in 2009, fans pointed out that the idea for Blockchain was thought of at least 20 years before bitcoin. Jeopardy! first aired in 1964 until 1975. Then the nighttime version began in 1974. Since then, spinoffs of the game show have emerged. Here they all are: Jeopardy! - (primetime) 1974 to present, weekdays on ABC at 7pm. Tournament of Champions - 1984 to present, features the top champions who have appeared on the show since the last tournament. Celebrity Jeopardy! - 1992 to present, has celebrities compete against each other to raise money for charity. Jeopardy! Masters - 2023 to present, features six notable recent Jeopardy! champions competing against each other. Jeopardy! National College Championship - 2022 to present, undergraduates from 36 colleges and universities across America compete to win $100,000. Other versions of Jeopardy! have fizzled out throughout the years. Bitcoin is a type of digital currency, which allows users to pay using encryption algorithms. Blockchain is a database that is used to record transactions. Amar went on to win the game . A Reddit user asked if they judges should have overturned Amar's answer because technically they were not the same thing. \"Bitcoin and blockchain are not the same! The clue as it was written unambiguously refers to Bitcoin: the genesis block of the Bitcoin blockchain was mined on Jan. 3, 2009,\" the original user said. \"However, the idea of the blockchain dates back over two decades before Bitcoin. David Chaum, who has done tons of work on digital currency, proposed a blockchain protocol in his PhD dissertation in 1982.\" \"While all blockchains have a genesis block - simply the first block on that respective chain - the use of the definite article ' the genesis block' together with the date in the clue makes the answer 'blockchain' far too general to be ruled correct in my opinion,\" they ended. Many fans agreed and said they weren't sure of the rationalization to overturn it. \"I think if Ken asked him to be more specific instead of outright ruling it incorrect he would’ve gotten the right answer,\" one fan said. \"Agree with this. The opportunity for 'be more specific' was lost,\" a Reddit user replied.",

        "content": "Egypt’s Minister of International Cooperation, Rania Al-Mashat, highlighted the need for a more flexible and inclusive international financial system to accelerate the implementation of sustainable development goals (SDGs) in Africa. She made this statement during the annual meetings of the African Development Bank (AfDB) held in Nairobi, Kenya, under the theme “Africa’s Transformation, the African Development Bank Group and Reforming the Global Financial Architecture”. The meetings, which took place against a backdrop of economic resilience in many African countries, focused on the bank’s commitment to creating a fair financial world to drive sustainable development and climate action. Despite a challenging global economic environment, 15 African countries have recorded production expansions exceeding 5%, and the AfDB’s “African Macroeconomic Performance and Outlook 2024 Report” predicts that Africa will remain the fastest-growing region in the world after Asia. Al-Mashat emphasized that the AfDB meetings were a continuation of global discussions on reforming the global financial structure, which began earlier this year at the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. She pointed to reports indicating that Africa needs $1.3 trillion annually to meet its sustainable development needs by 2030, underscoring the necessity for increased financing and a more adaptable financial system. During the meetings, Al-Mashat participated in various discussions and held bilateral meetings with bank officials and development partners such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The role of multilateral development banks in transforming the continent was also a key topic, with the AfDB advocating for better cooperation between these institutions, multi-year strategies, and increased funding. The AfDB is a significant development partner for Egypt, having provided over $7bn in development financing to finance 115 operations, including over $1bn for 24 private sector operations. Al-Mashat’s participation in the AfDB meetings followed her involvement in other international gatherings, such as the annual meetings of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the annual meetings of Arab financial institutions, and the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.",

        "content": "AN UPDATED DRAFT Online Safety Code has been criticised for not addressing “toxic” algorithms. Coimisiún na Meán, Ireland’s online and broadcast media regulator, The final code will set binding rules that will apply to video-sharing platforms who have their EU Headquarters in Ireland. Coimisiún na Meán has submitted the Code to the European Commission and once that process is complete, it will be applied later this year. The final Code will be part of Coimisiún na Meán’s overall Online Safety Framework, which aims to make digital services legally accountable for how they protect people, especially children, from harm online. The code will introduce obligations on video-sharing platforms that prohibit uploading or sharing harmful content, including cyberbullying. It will also prohibit the promotion of self-harm or eating disorders, as well as prohibit incitement to hatred or violence. The code will also require platforms to use age verification measures to prevent children from encountering pornography or violent videos. It will also provide parental controls for content which may “impair the physical, mental, or moral development of children under 16”. Coimisiún na Meán said the code will give it the tools to address the root causes of harm online, including the availability of illegal content, and inadequate protections for children on social media services. The Online Safety Commissioner, Niamh Hodnett, said the updated Code “is an important step forward to hold platforms to account for keeping people safe online”. However, the Code has been criticised by CyberSafeKids for not addressing “toxic” algorithms. The Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL) said it is “disappointed that measures to address toxic algorithms have been removed from the Online Safety Code”, and noted that a previous draft included requirements to turn off recommender systems. The recommender system is an algorithm that uses data to suggest items that a social media user might be interested in. An ICCL spokesperson said recommender systems “push hate and extremism into people’s feeds and inject content that glorifies self-harm and suicide into children’s feeds”. ICCL Senior Fellow Dr Johnny Ryan called it a “dangerous U-turn” and added that social media users should be given the “freedom to decide for themselves whether they can be profiled and fed algorithmic content”. And while CyberSafeKids welcomed the Code described it as a “landmark development”, it also expressed concern at “the fact this code does not address the recommender system”. A spokesperson for CyberSafeKids, an Irish charity which works to help children, parents and teachers navigate the online world, said a lot of “harmful content coming through a child’s feed originates from this algorithm”. The spokesperson added that at times, the social media feeds of children and young people are “overwhelmed” by harmful content, and they called for this to be “meaningfully addressed”. The Code also prohibits platforms from processing children’s data for commercial reasons, but CyberSafeKids said it is concerned that video-sharing platforms “will find ways to circumvent this if possible”. And when deciding on a user suspension, a video-sharing platform is obliged by the Code to assess cases in a “timely, diligent and objective manner”. CyberSafeKids said this “lacks the specific parameters we believe are necessary”. Online campaigning platform Uplift also criticised the Code for not addressing “toxic” algorithms. Its director Siobhán O’Donoghue said this was an opportunity to “change to the rules for how suggested content is directed at social media users”. “Turning off recommender systems by default would mean that these profit hungry platforms can’t just decide to flood teenage girls with weight loss content or push porn and gambling content at young men or abusive content targeting election candidates that spreads like wildfire on social media,” said O’Donoghue. She said a move to “force” video-sharing platforms to “stop automatically sending content based on your personal information, and instead giving users the choice to decide what you, would have been a game changer”.",

        "description": "At her wit's end after serious ongoing health problems couldn't produce a treatment or accurate diagnosis, one myeloma patient tells Minreet Kaur about her struggle to get her doctors to listen",
        "content": "Fatigued, breathless, filled with constant aches and pains in her ribs, and entirely lacking in energy, sales assistant Pritpal Kaur knew she was deeply unwell. “I could have slept all day,” says the 73 year old from Hillingdon, West London, of her symptoms, which began in May 2023. “I was back and forth to my GP surgery telling them about what was happening to me, but they offered no solutions.” Then one morning, things took a dramatic turn. “I couldn’t move at all,” says Pritpal. “I was meant to get up for work but I was in so much agony I was screaming. My daughter Minreet helped me to slowly get out of the bed and took me straight to the GP, who finally saw I was in so much pain that I was sent to A&E.” There, preliminary tests and scans found nothing, so Pritpal was sent home with a referral for an ultrasound to check for gallstones, which also came back clear. “At this point I couldn’t even take a full breath,” she recalls. “Eventually I was sent for a CT scan, which showed a narrowing of one artery, so I was diagnosed with mild angina and given blood thinners, but I continued to feel worse and worse.” Dunelm's 'most comfortable' hanging egg chair is 'perfect for British weather' \"Cancer really just wasn’t on my radar\" ( Image: COLLECT) Over the next few months, Pritpal developed severe lower back pain and cramps all over her body. “I went back to my GP yet again. This time I was fobbed off with the line that it was all down to old age and arthritis . “That just didn’t make sense to me. A few months before, I had been fit and active. I had run the London Marathon in April that year, so I knew it had to be something more serious.” At her wits’ end, in August Pritpal put in a complaint with PALS (the Patient Advice and Liaison Service), which offers confidential advice, support and information on health-related matters, at her local hospital. After explaining her symptoms once more, and that she felt she was getting worse, the cardiology team assessed her again and confirmed angina wasn’t the root of her issues. Returning to her GP surgery in tears of pain, Pritpal was sent for a blood test that picked up irregularities, while a bone density scan uncovered lesions and holes. An urgent referral to the hospital’s haematology department followed. “Despite all my symptoms, hearing the doctor talking about blood cancer was still a huge shock. I’d never heard of myeloma before. He said they would need to do a bone marrow test to confirm the diagnosis, but I still believed I would be given the all clear,” says Pritpal. “I am such an active person, I eat healthily, I’m a vegetarian and don’t drink. Cancer really just wasn’t on my radar.” There are over 24,000 people living with myeloma in the UK, with about 5,900 people diagnosed each year. According to Myeloma UK, 50 per cent of those with the cancer waited over five months for a diagnosis, with 31 per cent diagnosed via an emergency route such as a trip to A&E. Pritpal with her husband Rajinder ( Image: BBC) These are some of the longest delays out of any cancer in the UK. Pritpal waited over two weeks for her bone marrow results and when they came, in September 2023, the news was not good. “In an instant, my life turned upside down,” she recalls. “I just thought ‘this is the end of my life – how will my husband, Rajinder, cope?’ “I was told that if I didn’t have chemotherapy my bones would crack and I could go into kidney failure and die. If I’m honest, I didn’t want to have the treatment. I was scared because in the Asian community there’s a lot of negativity around chemo, but I spoke to my family and decided it was the best thing to do.” Myeloma is currently an incurable cancer, although treatment can be very effective at controlling the disease. Seven months on, consultants are telling Pritpal she has responded really well. “I hope there is light at the end of the tunnel as I continue on the treatment which is for life,” she says. “I just want to get back to walking and swimming, and be back at work. I miss my colleagues and having some kind of normality.” Unsurprisingly, Pritpal says she is still angry at the delays she experienced in her diagnosis. “I could have been diagnosed much earlier,” she says. “ I now have a hunchback and have lost height because of the damage the cancer has done. I wasn’t checked for myeloma, even though I had all the symptoms.” Pritpal is now campaigning to raise awareness of cancer, particularly among the Asian community where, she says, “It is a taboo – cancer isn’t talked about. “When I told people I had myeloma, some wouldn’t give me a hug and some even stopped talking to me. It’s as if they feel it’s contagious. It has been really hard. People I thought would be there for me didn’t even ask how I was. It’s an isolating place to be. “Cancer is tough to live with, but it’s even harder when you are from a community where there is so little understanding of it. Some won’t tell others if they have it because they feel they will be judged. There are others who mistrust the NHS and put off getting checked for symptoms. I would have left it too if I hadn’t been in so much pain. “We need to speak up more and help others. Raising awareness is so important. I would hate for someone else to be in my position. If something doesn’t feel right, get it checked.” For more information, visit Myeloma UK at myeloma.org.uk, or call their infoline on 0800 980 3332 Frankie Bridge fans obsessed with 'amazing' £45 linen River Island dress",

        "content": "PARIS, France, May 27 – Rafael Nadal’s return to the French Open – and possible farewell – ended at the first hurdle as the 14-time champion lost to Alexander Zverev. The 22-time Grand Slam champion was beaten 6-3 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 by the in-form German fourth seed. Nadal has become synonymous with Roland Garros but, in front of a partisan crowd, he could not replicate the level which has made him almost unbeatable on the Paris clay. The 37-year-old indicated when he missed last year’s French Open that the 2024 season could be his final one on tour. He has also said he does not know if this will be his final time at the clay-court major – but it remains a “big chance” it will be. Nadal arrived on Court Philippe Chatrier – the scene of many of the finest moments of his career – to a thunderous reception from a packed stadium. While nowhere near his scintillating best, the former world number one showed flashes of the brilliance that has made him so loved, but not enough to stringently test Zverev. It was only Nadal’s fourth defeat in 116 singles matches at Roland Garros and Zverev became the third man – after Robin Soderling in 2009 and Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021 – to beat him there. “I don’t know if it’ll be the last time I’m going to be here in front of you. If it is I have enjoyed it,” Nadal said in an on-court speech. “The crowd have been amazing the whole week. For me it’s so special to feel the love of the people the way I have felt.” With some fans crying in the stands, Nadal departed to another standing ovation as the crowd showed their appreciation for the tournament’s finest champion. Anticipation for Nadal’s return had been frenzied all day, with fans of the iconic champion – easily identified by Spanish red and yellow flags and ‘Gracias Rafa’ T-shirts – milling around the arena as soon as the gates opened. After a dismal defeat by Hubert Hurkacz in Rome last month, Nadal had not even been sure if he would be ready to compete here. Rafael Nadal leaves in possibly his last ever match at teh French Open. PHOTO/Roland Garros/X In a bullish pre-tournament news conference, he said he quickly found the motivation to return and felt his practice session showed he could “play against anyone”. Practice is very different to a match, of course, and Nadal knew that. He also knew he faced a monumental task against Zverev. With the 275th-ranked Nadal unseeded at Roland Garros for the first time, having barely played because of injury in the past 18 months, it left him vulnerable to facing a leading player when the draw was made. Zverev is considered one of the finest players not to have won a major title and, being a strong clay-court athlete, stands a good chance of finally joining the pantheon of Grand Slam winners over the next fortnight. He reached the 2022 French Open semi-finals, retiring against Nadal after a nasty fall which led to a serious ankle injury, and tuned up this year by winning the Rome title earlier this month. The way in which the 27-year-old played against Nadal reiterated why he is among the favourites. Zverev’s performances at Roland Garros will play out alongside a trial over domestic violence allegations. Zverev has denied the charges, with a hearing set to begin on Friday in Germany. An ominous start for Nadal saw Zverev break in the first game of the match, with a poor drop shot into the net and a double fault from the Spaniard heavily contributing. Each mistake by Zverev early on was cheered by the pro-Nadal crowd and, after saving two break points for a 3-1 lead, the German exerted his control before breaking again for the set. Nadal, playing with more aggression and intensity, raised hopes again by moving into a 4-2 second-set lead. But as quickly as belief increased, Zverev took it away. The Olympic champion remained composed, upping his level in the 10th game to break back with some precise ball-striking. The gravitas of the occasion was illustrated by Nadal’s great rival Djokovic, along with defending women’s champion Iga Swiatek and Wimbledon men’s champion Carlos Alcaraz, sitting in the stands to watch. Like the second set, they watched Nadal move a break up in the third before buckling again under more pressure as Zverev stormed back from 2-1 down to 4-3 in front. Nadal, as he has always done in his illustrious career, refused to give up and created two break points in the eighth game, but Zverev came through in a strong finish. “The first round wasn’t the ideal one, but I was competitive, I had my chances,” said Nadal. “But it was not enough against a great player.”",

        "content": "Speaking in a recent interview with , the Newcastle-born footballer was asked which stadium he would love to play in and the Ipswich star responded with “St James’ Park”. Davis continued by saying: “It’s incredible how it’s turned around, everyone up there in Newcastle is so happy at the minute.” When asked if his biggest ambition is to play for the Magpies, the defender responded by saying “Definitely.” Newcastle have been linked with a move for Davis in recent months with stating that the Tyneside club and West Ham are keeping an eye on the 24-year-old as a result of the impressive season he has had at Portman Road. The left-back has featured in 44 matches for Ipswich this season, producing two goals and an eye-catching 21 assists. With a contract expiring in 2025, a big offer could see Ipswich sell the star, and it remains to be seen if Newcastle make the defender’s dreams come true. Newcastle interested in Ipswich Town’s Leif Davis Left-back has been a problematic position for Eddie Howe this season with the Magpies boss often having to play Dan Burn in the role due to a lack of options. Howe began to trust Lewis Hall towards the end of the campaign and the 19-year-old responded positively. The defender is set to join Newcastle permanently from Chelsea this summer and that will hamper any potential deal for Davis. The Tyneside club have no need for the Ipswich star at present unless the full-back is happy to play a support role.",

        "content": "CHENNAI: Mitchell Starc bowled a sensational opening spell to fire Kolkata Knight Riders to their third Indian Premier League title with a eight-wicket thrashing of Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Sunday final. Kolkata bowled out Hyderabad for IPL’s lowest total of 113 in a final as Australia’s left-arm quick Starc returned figures of 2-14 to live up to his top billing in the world’s most lucrative T20 tournament. Starc went to Kolkata for a record $2.98 million in the December auction and ended the IPL with two stellar performances, including a match-winning 3-34 in the first play-off to hammer the same opponent. Kolkata’s batsmen had it easy and despite Sunil Narine’s early departure, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, who made 39, and Venkatesh Iyer, on 52 not out, helped the team home with 9.3 overs to spare after a partnership of 91. Iyer, a left-handed batsman, reached his 50 in 24 balls and hit the winning runs to trigger celebrations for Kolkata, who remained the most dominant team after they ended top of the table with 20 points in the league phase. Skipper Shreyas Iyer was unbeaten on six, and at the other end, when Kolkata players came rushing on to the pitch and the stadium fireworks went off. “Great night for KKR. What a game, what a season,” player-of-the-match Starc said. “Probably the two most exciting teams in the final. We have had a fantastic squad of bowlers and batters, our staff have been fantastic to get everyone peaking.” On the pressure of his high price tag, 34-year-old Starc said: “There’s been jokes about the money. I am experienced, that’s helped with all the expectations.” Players and national teams now move into the T20 World Cup starting June 1 in the West Indies and the United States. ‘Mom is watching’ Afghanistan’s Gurbaz, who left the tournament midway through to be with his ailing mother back home and returned for the play-offs, said: “My mom is watching from home. “She is feeling good now. I asked mom before the match if she wanted anything. She said just the win,” added the wicket-keeper-batsman. Kolkata’s co-owner and Bollywood superstar actor Shah Rukh Khan was in attendance and congratulated his champion players after he suffered from a heat-related illness in the first qualifier in Ahmedabad. It was Kolkata’s second title triumph at the venue, after they won their first trophy in 2012, and a near-capacity crowd at the 36,000-seater stadium cheered on. Narine, a left-hand batsman and a right-arm spinner, ended as the player of the series with 488 runs as an opener and 17 wickets. Gambhir effect Apart from the big signing of Starc, they got Gautam Gambhir as mentor after the former India batsman led the team to their first two titles, including in 2014. Hyderabad skipper Pat Cummins won the toss and elected to bat first and go with his team’s strength of scoring big, after they racked up IPL record totals of 277 and 287 in this year’s edition. Hyderabad took Cummins for $2.5 million in the same auction and made him captain after he led Australia to two titles, including the World Test Championship and the ODI World Cup last year. “So many (positives), the style with which the guys played especially with the bat. Lot of skills to get to 250 three times,” said Cummins. “I loved how brave the guys were. It was a lot of fun, great season.” But it was Starc who took the limelight as he struck in his first over when he bowled in-form Indian batsman Abhishek Sharma, for two, on a delivery that pitched in the middle and caught the top of off stump. Travis Head followed his fellow left-hand opener Abhishek to the dug-out, caught behind for his second duck in three matches off fast bowler Vaibhav Arora. Starc struck again and the opposition top-order was in disarray at 47-4 inside seven overs. Andre Russell took down Aiden Markram for 20 and wickets kept tumbling as fellow South African Heinrich Klaasen fell for 16. Cummins, who was dropped on 10 by Starc, took the team past 100 before falling for 24 off Russell, who ended with figures of 3-19. — AFP",

        "content": "One of Canada’s best track athletes will compete at the Victoria Track Classic at the University of Victoria’s Centennial Stadium on Wednesday, June 12. Lucia Stafford qualified for the Paris Olympics after a strong performance in Los Angeles and will compete in the women’s 800 meters in Victoria. “Lucia recently made Olympic standard in a strong 1500-meter field in Los Angeles with a time of 4:02. That makes her the fastest in Canada at this time as she builds towards Paris,” said Rowan Debues-Stafford, Track Classic Meet Director. The Victoria Track Classic includes men’s 100m, women’s 100m hurdles, men’s and women’s 400m, 800m, and 1500m races, and women’s discus. It is a world-sanctioned event, and competitors can earn points to secure selection for national or Olympic teams. “It’s awesome to be competing in Victoria,” Stafford said. “This is the home track for both my siblings, so it’s like a home meet in some ways.” The Victoria Track Classic was founded in 1988 and has hosted various Canadian Olympians, including Melissa Bishop, Diane Cummins, Angela Chalmers and Debbie Scott, in the 800 and 1500 meters. “The West Coast has been kind to me so far this season, so I’m excited to get back out here, surrounded by the Canadian track community, as I fine-tune ahead of Nationals and Paris,” Stafford said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched passenger train service on the route a few months ago. The train service has hugely benefitted the people of Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara and Jajpur. Once the line is doubled, the Railway will run Vande Metro on the route,” Vaishnaw told a news agency. The Railway Minister revealed that the proposed Jajpur-Dhamra railway line will be taken up soon. The railway line will pass through Jajpur town, Aradi and Chandabali, he said. “The DPR for the Rs 2,552 crore railway project is being prepared now,” added the Railway Minister. Notably, the Vande Metro trains are tailored to cater to urban commuters travelling distances up to 250 km.",

        "content": "Relatives of alleged murder victim Kyle Schuiling who might have hoped to see his accused killer left court Monday disappointed. Defence counsel Kirsten Lancee appeared on behalf of accused killer Christopher Stack in connection with the discovery of Schuiling’s body near a burned-out field west of the city in early April. Lancee, appearing as agent for lawyer Andrea Urquhart, said that while Urquhart had received a certificate from Legal Aid to represent Stack, she can’t take the case because of a conflict between the lawyer and Schuiling. As a result, defence counsel Tonii Roulston will be taking over the file and Lancee asked Justice Jim Ogle to adjourn the case for two weeks so the lawyer can review initial disclosure and seek further materials from the Crown. “Ms. Tonii Roulston of our office does not have the same conflict as she does not know the victim,” Lancee said. The Calgary Court of Justice judge ordered Stack detained on the murder charge. Because of his charge Stack can only seek release on bail in Court of King’s Bench. Following the brief court appearance three members of the deceased’s family declined to comment on the case. Stack, 39, was arrested by Mounties earlier this month and charged with first-degree murder in the death of Schuiling. He was on release on other charges, including three counts of possession of stolen property and failing to comply with probation at the time of his arrest. Schuiling’s remains were found April 3 by Tsuut’ina firefighters while battling a grass fire near Hwy. 8 and Range Road 40 in Rocky View County, about 12 kilometres west of Calgary. Schuiling’s Facebook page stated he worked as an oilpatch roughneck, was living in Vancouver and had studied addictions counselling at a Calgary career college. Prior to Stack’s arrest, Schuiling’s family had released a photo of him in the hopes it would assist investigators. A cause of death has not been released. Stack’s case is back in Calgary Court of Justice on June 10. -with files from Steve Jenkinson X: @KMartinCourts",

        "content": "A DOG groomer has started to notice how some pooches are putting on the pounds. They shared how the two breeds in particular were not only starting to change shape, but also exhibiting bad behaviors. They were taking note on the noticeable changes they had witnessed. \"Anyone else getting big Scotties lately?\" the groomer asked in a post on Pet Groomer Forums . \"For the past several years, the Scotties and Westies have been getting bigger and much heavier bodied,\" they added. And that wasn't the only difference they had noticed in the dogs. They explained how their legs also seemed to be getting shorter and more \"crooked\" in the front. They also blamed the pet parents for at least part of it. \"And then the owners fatten them up,\" they said. \"Almost can't do front legs on them anymore.\" They also had to put up with another pungent problem. \"And they stink - really oily coats and tons of skin problems that are just awful to cure,\" they said. \"Really temperamental, too.\" They were certainly not making their job any easier. \"The Scotties have really big heavy jaws and big teeth,\" they said. \"They don't snap - they really bite hard and will fight the muzzle and thrash their head till they get it off.\" They weren't sure if the modifications were being done purposefully by breeders, but regardless of the reason, they wanted to stay away from these troublesome types. \"I'm scared they will harm themselves or I will hurt it just trying to wrestle it for doing feet,\" they said. \"After grooming one I can't get the stink off of me and everything has to be washed. \"Yuck! Getting turned off Scotties and Westies.\" The Scottish Terrier is a solidly compact canine according to the American Kennel Club . The average Scotty is ten inches tall with males weighing up to 22 pounds and females averaging 18 to 21 pounds. Expert advice from Dr. Sara Ochoa, who has been practicing veterinary medicine for over five years. Ochoa told The U.S. Sun observing a dog's behavior can provide clues that they might act out. “A dog that looks tense all over with its fur sticking up or teeth showing is more likely to snap,\" she said. “Staring real hard without blinking could mean trouble too. \"Growling is also a warning the dog is getting mad.\" She said dogs may tuck their tail between their legs when they feel scared or threatened. “Staying calm and keeping space may help things not to escalate if a dog seems on edge,\" she said. They are described as being known for their short stature and wiry topcoat. These hunters also enjoy brisk walks. Meanwhile, the West Highland White Terrier, known as the Westie, should weigh between 13 and 15 pounds, according to the American Kennel Club . The ideal proportions are 11 inches at the withers for the males and eight inches for the females. They are usually known for their \"good balance.\" Their body between the withers and the root of the tail is slightly shorter than the height at the withers. They are also short-coupled and have a roundish appearance. Another user could relate to their story about one of the breeds. \"I love the Westies, I do, and the three Scotties I see are all really good, but one is huge - 35 pounds last vet visit - and another one has those terrible legs,\" they wrote. \"She had to have metal plates put on both of them because of some weird bone disease,\" they added. The commenter also had beef with another breed - the schnauzer. \"All of them look alike and scream bloody murder if you touch their beards or try and shave their heads or ears,\" they said. \"They all are puppy store purchases and are under a year old so I'm betting on bad breeding. Your situation is probably the same. Greedy people breeding bad quality dogs for profit.\" Yet another shared their own horror tales. \"There was a basset and Scottie mix that used to come into the shop I was at. That thug was like a Scottie on steroids. He was huge and nasty,\" said the commenter. \"Evil, no good dog, unpredictable, big fat teeth, and horrid. I refused to touch him and watched as another groomer went to war with him every time he came in.\"",

        "content": "Following the U.S. imposing tariffs on electric vehicles, Canada might be looking at doing something similar. In an interview with CBC , Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry of Canada François-Philippe Champagne said that the Canadian government isn’t ruling out imposing tariffs on Chinese EVs. Following that, industry leaders from various automotive manufacturing arms in Canada have also expressed a desire for Canada to follow through on this. This may lead to pressure on the cabinet to impose similar tariffs as the U.S. Other parts of the world, like Europe, have seen their auto markets change lately as low-cost EVs made in China hit the market. China has stronger programs and incentives, along with potentially cheaper labour, which has allowed it to expand quickly into the EV space. Since most other automakers are focusing on high-end EVs instead, the market is jumping on the opportunity to go electric for a reasonable price. In a bid to protect its giant auto industry of 39 million workers, the U.S. has imposed stronger tariffs on Chinese EVs to keep prices in line with American-made competition. While Canada’s auto industry is much smaller at 500,000 workers, there is still a precedent from the U.S. that we impose something similar. Source: CBC , Global News",

        "content": "SAN DIEGO — In the highest-scoring final game in Mountain West Championship history, Fresno State’s offensive explosion at the plate was too much for San Jose State in a 16-11 slugfest on Sunday afternoon at Tony Gwynn Stadium. The Diamond ‘Dogs captured their second MW tournament title in program history and their first since 2019. The Bulldogs (33-27) secured the MW’s automatic bid in the NCAA playoffs with the victory. On Friday, they will face host and No. 14 national seed UC Santa Barbara (42-12) of the Big West in a first-round game. The Bulldogs had to overcome four home runs and seven RBI from Hunter Dorraugh of San Jose State (24-33) to win the title game. It was quite a turnaround for Fresno State, which fell 3-2 in the tournament opener to Air Force on Thursday and extended its losing streak to six straight. The Bulldogs staved off elimination with a 6-1 win over New Mexico on Friday. The next day, they sent regular-season champion Air Force home with a 10-3 win and forced the NCAA-deciding tournament berth rematch with San Jose State by dropping the Spartans 8-5. Sunday’s Bulldog Heroes Tyler Davis and Justin Stransky brought in half of Fresno State’s runs as both went 3-for-5 with four RBIs. Jaykob Acosta got the win, striking out seven and allowing one run in 3 2⁄3 innings in relief of Jake Dixon, who started his second game of the MW tournament. Murf Gray was named the MW Championship Most Valuable Player. The sophomore was 11-for-21 at the plate in five games, driving in seven RBIs and scoring eight runs. Seven of his 11 hits went for extra bases, recording five doubles and two home runs. Gray was joined on the All-Tournament Team by Acosta, Stransky, Noah Beal, Tommy Hopfe, and Jake Riding. The title game box score is . How It Happened The Spartan offense got going early, scoring the first run of the game with a solo home run in the bottom of the first. A double down the left-field line almost allowed the Spartans to score another run, but the relay from Bobby Blanford to Gray to Davis, the catcher, was in time to get the runner out at home. Fresno State’s bats got hot in the third as Michael McKernan doubled down the left-field line with two outs on the board. Ben Newton drove in McKernan, a single to right field, and crossed the plate himself after a two-run bomb from Hopfe. Blandford and Stransky hit back-to-back home runs in the fourth to keep the Diamond ‘Dog offense rolling. San Jose State responded with a solo shot to center field in the bottom of the frame to halve the Bulldogs lead at 6-3. The hits kept coming in the fifth as Grady Morgan doubled to bring in Hopfe. Singles from Davis and Stransky plated another three runs as the advantage grew to eight. Acosta sent the Spartans down in order in the bottom of the fifth, finishing it with back-to-back strikeouts. Fresno State batted around in the sixth. The ‘Dogs loaded the bases with no outs. Eddie Saldivar hit a sacrifice fly to center to bring in McKernan. After Morgan was hit by a pitch, a single from Gray brought in Newton. With a 2-0 count, Davis ripped a shot down the left line to clear the bases. A pitching change did not cool the bats as Blandford singled and Stransky doubled to score Davis. After the Bulldogs were held scoreless in the ninth, Hopfe allowed back-to-back singles to start the bottom of the inning. The senior closer then shut the door with a pair of flyouts bookending a strikeout.",

        "description": "A Mirror poll has revealed the public want rapid action to stop kids accessing harmful content on social media, as Molly Russell's dad says it's a 'matter of life or death'",
        "content": "Social media firms should be forced almost immediately to stop children seeing harmful content, voters have demanded. A Mirror poll has revealed the public want rapid action to prevent algorithms bombarding kids with material relating to suicide and eating disorders. Six in 10 (60%) want this to happen by the end of July, while a further 22% said it should be before the end of this year. Just 2% were against it, according to the survey conducted by Whitestone Insight. Most people are also in favour of forcing online giants to introduce robust age checks on social media, such as requiring photo ID. Some 43% want this by the summer, while 26% believe it should be in place by the end of this year. Only 8% say they’re happy to wait until some point next year. Just 8% were against the proposal. The idea of banning under-16s from having smartphones is not widely supported, however. Some 43% are against, while 36% are in favour. Ofcom has put forward proposals that would require tech firms to stop their algorithms recommending harmful content to children and introduce robust age checks. But the regulator has said its final code may not be published until summer 2025, after which companies will have three months to assess the guidance. Parliament will need to approve the code, which could also take time. The dad of Molly Russell , who took her own life at age 14 in 2017 after being exposed to harmful content online, last night said the issue was a “matter of life or death” as he responded to the poll findings. Molly Russell took her own life at age 14 in 2017 after being exposed to harmful content online ( Image: PA) The Online Safety Act was originally proposed by Theresa May in 2019 but it took years to become law due to political chaos and divisions over the legislation. While it finally became law in October, Ofcom can't use new powers to hold social media firms to account until the end of a lengthy consultation on updating its guidance. Ofcom earlier this month published its draft Children’s Safety Codes of Practice, which sets out more than 40 practical measures tech giants must implement to meet new legal duties. If tech companies fail to comply with the guidance when it is introduced, they could be fined up to 10% of their global turnover or have their services blocked in the UK. The mother of murdered teen Brianna Ghey has warned that more young lives could be lost due to delays to the social media crackdown. Earlier this month, Esther Ghey told the Mirror : “I totally understand Ofcom’s view that we need to cross the Ts and dot the Is, and everything needs to be perfect so social media companies can’t come back and take legal action. But during this time we’re potentially losing more children’s lives. Also, there are children who are struggling with their mental health, there are children who are self-harming and we do need to try to get this done as soon as possible.” Whitestone Insight interviewed 2,024 adults in Britain online on May 15 and 16. 'There is no time to waste,' says dad who lost his daughter The dad of a 14-year-old girl who took her own life after being exposed to harmful content online says it is a “matter of life or death” whether a clampdown on social media takes place urgently. Molly Russell’s father Ian said there is “no time to waste” as he responded to our exclusive poll findings. Molly, from Harrow, in north west London, saw more than 2,000 harmful posts about suicide, self-harm and depression in the last six months of her life. Mr Russell said: “It’s only effective regulation that will finally make big tech address the preventable harm they cause to children and families. The cost of years of industry inaction should be measured in lost young lives, and that’s why getting world-leading regulation in force is nothing less than a matter of life or death.” Molly Russell's dad Ian warned there is no time to waste ( Image: Daily Mirror) The campaigner added: “There is no time to waste to protect young people from harm. Social media companies have consistently put their bottom line before taming toxic algorithms and the results have been devastating. The next Government should commit to new legislation to strengthen the Online Safety Act regime as this will ensure we see the swiftest and most decisive change. Effort wasted on other, hastily conceived policies is unlikely to be as effective and may end up causing more harm than good.” An inquest in 2022 concluded that Molly died from an act of self-harm while suffering depression and the negative effects of online content. Coroner Andrew Walker said the images of self-harm and suicide she viewed \"shouldn't have been available for a child to see\". *If you're struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open 24/7 on 116 123.

        "content": "NBA fans weren't in agreement with Shannon Sharpe's latest opinion on the Boston Celtics. The NFL icon Sharpe, 54, went on a two-minute rant about the Celtics during Monday's edition of ESPN's First Take. The Celtics have a 3-0 lead over the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals. Two of Boston's wins came when Indiana blew two leads, the most recent one coming in Game 3 when the Celtics rallied back after being down 18 points in the third quarter. While alongside Stephen A. Smith in ESPN's Los Angeles studios, Sharpe revealed his thoughts that he thinks the Pacers should not be one loss away from being swept in the ECF. \"The Pacers have been really bad in clutch situations,\" Sharpe said. \"Right now, Stephen A., the Pacers should be up 2-1. \"They gave Game 1 away ... They gave Game 3 away.\" Sharpe acknowledged the Celtics' efforts in coming back in the two games, specifically Jrue Holliday and his 28-point game in the first comeback win as well as his defensive contributions throughout the series. But the NFL Hall of Famer doesn't believe Boston's knack for coming back in games won't be sustainable, especially if they play the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA Finals. \"If you go down 18 to the Dallas Mavericks, you're not coming back,\" Sharpe said. The Mavericks also have a 3-0 series lead in their Conference Finals series and are one win away from making the NBA Finals. On social media, NBA fans raged over Sharpe's lack of credit to the Boston team. \"They’re quite literally running out of things to say,\" one wrote. \"Why do other teams get credit for winning games they were down in, but we get hammered for it?\" a Celtics fan asked \"Give us credit,\" another Celtics fan commented. Sharpe wasn't done with his rant concerning the Celtics as he called their playoff run \"easy\". He cited the Celtics' not playing numerous stars due to injury which include the Miami Heat's Jimmy Butler, Cleveland Cavalier's Donavon Mitchel, and Pacers' Tyrese Haliburton. Sharpe finished his tirade by saying that the Celtics could find it tougher to come back in a potential NBA Finals matchup with the Mavericks due to their play style as well as Dallas' stars Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. \"I don't like what I'm seeing because they keep falling behind by 15 and relying on three-point shots to get back in a ballgame,\" Sharpe said. \"I don't know if they'll be able to do this against the Dallas Mavericks.\" The Celtics will play the potential series-clinching Game 4 contest with the Pacers on Monday night in Indiana.",

        "content": "A 51-year-old rancher and 34 of his cattle became the latest victims of a spate of severe weather over the weekend. According to press accounts in Jackson County, Colorado , rancher Mike Morgan was feeding his cattle with hay from his trailer on Saturday when a bolt of lightning killed him and knocked over 100 of the animals, roughly a third of which died. “As best I can tell, it hit him on the trailer. The cattle were bunched up around the trailer and it hit them all,” county coroner George Crocket said, as reported by the Colorado Sun . The outlet noted that Morgan’s father-in-law and wife were both in the vicinity and survived. They had spent the early part of the day branding cattle. By early afternoon storm clouds engulfed the sky as they were feeding the herd. Crocket described the incident as unusually deadly. “I’ve seen horses get killed, but it’s usually one at a time,” he said, according to the Sun . He added that his grandfather once lost seven cattle to a lightning strike. The outlet described Morgan as an outspoken rancher who was vocal about issues stemming from the reintroduction of wolves in the area. “We need to get our way of life out to the people because they don’t understand our livelihood, the emotional impact and the financial impact,” he said in 2022. Elsewhere in the country over the weekend, more than two dozen tornadoes touched down in five states, killing at least 20 people and injuring scores more. Texas was especially impacted, with more than 100 injuries reported and disasters declared in 106 counties, the Associated Press noted . In Cooke County, two young children from the same family were fatally wounded. Deaths were also reported in Oklahoma and Arkansas, with additional twisters sighted in Missouri and Kansas. Arkansas also suffered from a landslide over the weekend that off traffic on some sections of a highway in both directions.",

The chaos came on top of pre-planned Network Rail engineering work on the West Coast Main Line route resulting in longer journeys between London and Scotland . It was also a busy day to drive, with the RAC estimating 3.4million motorists took to the roads today. The sheer number of motors on the road coincided with the beginning of half-term for most schools in England and Wales . Traffic queues built up on the A102M Blackwall Tunnel approach in Greenwich, London, as families made their return journeys after the end of the long weekend. And large queues were seen building up on the M25 near Brentwood, Essex. The busy motorway also experienced heavy traffic near Iver, Buckinghamshire, this afternoon. Drivers were urged to check traffic conditions before setting off after the three-day-weekend drew to a close. In London, there was disruption on the Elizabeth line between Paddington and Southall due to a speed restriction imposed over defective track. Meanwhile, Overground trains faced delays due to an object becoming stuck in overhead power cables. There were also problems on Thameslink trains due to a signalling fault between St Albans and West Hampstead. Meanwhile, passengers faced complications on Transport for Wales between Shrewsbury and Wrexham due to an emergency incident. Over the bank holiday weekend, holidaymakers at the Port of Dover reported processing times of two hours at French border controls. In addition, drivers also reported\"gridlock\" in the town itself due to the increased traffic going to the port. One family were still in a queue to get to border control four hours after arriving in Dover. A Port of Dover spokesperson advised that for safety reasons travellers should stay in their vehicles and thanked passengers for their patience. A spokesperson for ferry operator DFDS said: \"We are expecting a busy weekend. \"We highly recommend all customers have a confirmed reservation \"Please allow 120 minutes to complete border and check-in controls on arrival.\" It comes as holidaymakers at Birmingham Airport were forced to queue for hours to get through security in half-term holiday mayhem. Thousands of passengers have been stuck in queues for more than an hour . The airport is reportedly overhauling its security system in time for the summer holidays - sparking half term chaos. Some passengers have reportedly been pulled out of the queues because the gate is closing for their flights. Peterborough mum Hannah Wright said: \"Security is a shambles -anyone can come this far. \"We've been waiting an hour to fly to Majorca. Our son is claustrophobic so it's hard for him. \"It's put a dampener on the start of our holiday. There is nothing in place for children who might struggle in situations like this.\" Earlier this month Border Control e-gates at UK airports including Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester broke down in a \"major incident\". Passengers waited for hours in queues overnight after an airport IT system crashed - sparking \"pandemonium\" for thousands.",

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsConsider a position in these stocks, each of which looks attractively valued right now and has an affordable share price.The post 3 Cheap Stocks That Could Be Worth a Fortune by Summer appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Despite the stock market being at an all-time high , plenty of bargains remain to be found for investors. The bull rally that began in autumn 2022 is only now starting to broaden out to include utilities, retailers, industrial stocks and other sectors of the economy. It’s no longer just big tech stocks that are marching higher. So, many stocks are starting to rise. So, this presents an opportunity for investors to buy stocks as they bottom and begin to climb higher. Many well-known companies have stocks that still look cheap in terms of valuation and share price. Catalysts such as strong earnings are starting to move share prices higher. For other stocks, a post-earnings dip is presenting a buying opportunity. However you look at it, bargains abound in the current market. Let’s explore three cheap stocks that could be worth a fortune by summer. Canada Goose Holdings (GOOS) After being in the doldrums for the last five years, things are starting to look up for Canada Goose Holdings (NYSE: GOOS ). The share price jumped 25% higher after the maker of winter parkas beat analyst expectations for its latest financial results. Investors needn’t worry that they’ve missed the move in GOOS stock. Even with the big post-earnings bounce, Canada Goose’s share price is still down 72% over the last five years. Furthermore, GOOS stock still has plenty of room to run, and the move higher may have just begun. After struggling with declining sales coming out of the pandemic, the company finally reported a turnaround . EPS came in at 19 cents compared to 7 cents that was forecast among analysts. Revenue in what was the company’s fiscal Q4 totaled $358 million, beating expectations of $315.5 million. Key to the turnaround were sales in Asia-Pacific, including China, which rose 29.6% during the quarter. In North America, sales rose 24.5% year-over-year ( YOY ) after a 14% decline in the previous quarter. The latest financial results come after Canada Goose announced in March plans to cut 17% of its global workforce as it seeks to realign its business. Chubb Ltd. (CB) News that Chubb Ltd. (NYSE: CB ) was the mystery stock that Warren Buffett had been concealing has lit a fuse under the Swiss insurer’s share price. Buffett has built an astounding $6.7 billion stake in Chubb Ltd., which has sent its stock up nearly 10% in only a few days, hitting a 52-week high in the process. Buffett’s purchase of nearly 26 million shares of the Zurich-based property and casualty insurer is seen as the ultimate vote of confidence in the stock. In fact, CB stock has been a strong performer , having gained 37% over the last 12 months, including a 20% gain this year. However, the valuation still looks attractive, with the shares trading at only 12 times future earnings estimates. And, its quarterly dividend payment of 86 cents per share gives the stock a strong yield of 1.25%. Given the share price appreciation, low price-earnings ratio and decent dividend, it’s easy to understand Buffett’s fondness for CB stock. Now that Buffett has built a stake in Chubb, the share price is likely to continue rising , making it a cheap stock to buy. Airbnb (ABNB) Anyone looking to buy a post-earnings dip should consider Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB ). Shares of the short-term rental company dropped nearly 10% on forward guidance that was below Wall Street estimates, presenting a buy-the-dip opportunity. The guidance obscured what was a solid print from Airbnb. For the first quarter, the company posted EPS of 41 cents, which was well ahead of a consensus estimate of 24 cents. The quarterly profit was up 126% from a year ago and the company’s best first quarter ever. Revenue totaled $2.14 billion , ahead of Wall Street forecasts of $2.06 billion. Sales were up 18% from a year earlier. Gross bookings came in at $22.90 billion, up 12% YOY, while nights and experiences booked rose 9.5% to $132.6 million. Despite the strong quarter, Airbnb’s guidance fell short of expectations, sending the stock lower. Investors should pick-up the stock on the cheap . Year-to-date ( YTD ), ABNB stock is up only 8%. However, the share price is 15% below its 52-week high and trading at only 19 times future earnings estimates. In time, the stock should rise, especially with the busy summer travel season upon us.

        "content": "Former President Donald Trump marked Memorial Day with a controversial message on Truth Social, targeting his critics. Trump posted a scathing comment directed at those he believes are working against the nation, calling them “Human Scum” and lamenting the state of the country. In a separate post, Trump insisted that his appearance at the Libertarian National Convention on Saturday was a success, despite being met with boos and jeers. He claimed that the crowd’s enthusiasm was palpable and argued that he could have secured the party’s nomination for the White House if he had desired it. Trump also criticized independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., saying, “Only a FOOL would vote for him!” and accusing Kennedy of “destroying everything he’s touched.” Trump’s attempts to appeal to Libertarians were met with mockery and insults. In response, he urged the audience to support him if they wanted to win, saying, “Maybe you don’t want to win, only do that if you want to win. If you want to lose, don’t do that. Keep getting three per cent every four years.” Trump also attended the Coca-Cola 600 NASCAR race in Concord, North Carolina, on Sunday. Meanwhile, his criminal hush money trial in New York is set to resume on Tuesday as it enters its final stages. Trump Leads Biden Among Arab and Muslim American Voters A recent New York Times-Siena College poll revealed that Trump leads President Joe Biden 57-25 among Arab and Muslim American voters in five key battleground states, a significant shift from 2020 when these voters largely supported Biden. However, these results may not fully predict the voting trends for the November election, with potential surprises still on the horizon, especially concerning the Gaza conflict, a contentious issue among these voters. Biden’s Democratic campaign has noted a decline in the number of “uncommitted” voters protesting the President in primary elections. An exit poll from Michigan’s presidential primary in February showed 94 percent of Muslim voters casting “uncommitted” ballots in protest of Biden’s support for Israel’s actions in Gaza. This percentage has since decreased in states like Nebraska, Maryland, and West Virginia. Biden secured 90 percent of votes in Nebraska’s primary against challenger Dean Phillips and similarly high support in Maryland. Conversely, Trump dominated West Virginia, capturing 88 percent of the vote there. Trump’s campaign is strategically courting Arab American voters who feel alienated by the Democratic stance on the Middle East. A private meeting in Michigan, attended by Trump’s former ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, aimed to rally support from Arab American donors and activists. Grenell, although not formally part of Trump’s campaign, is seen as a potential contender for a high-level national security position should Trump win in November. Other attendees included Michael Boulos, husband of Tiffany Trump, and his father, Massad Boulos, a Lebanese business tycoon. Despite Trump’s efforts, his previous term included policies that were unpopular among Arab Americans, such as immigration restrictions from Muslim-majority countries and cuts to humanitarian aid for Palestinians. Analysts suggest Trump might support the Israeli government even more than Biden if re-elected. Trump Comments on Nikki Haley and Vice Presidential Picks In another development, Trump addressed former GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley’s recent declaration of support for him. During an interview with Long Island’s News 12, Trump expressed appreciation for Haley’s comments and suggested there could be a place for her on his “team.” He described her as a “capable person” despite their contentious primary battle, where he often insulted her intelligence and referred to her as “birdbrain.” Haley, during her first public speaking event since exiting the race, indicated her preference for Trump over Biden, stating, “Trump has not been perfect on these policies. I’ve made that clear many, many times. But Biden has been a catastrophe. So I will be voting for Trump.” Although Trump previously dismissed the idea of Haley as his running mate, he acknowledged her potential role in his campaign. In the same interview, Trump mentioned several other names he is considering for vice president, including Ben Carson, Sen. Marco Rubio, Sen. JD Vance, and Rep. Elise Stefanik.",

They claim that the coast “is a landfill,” while describing a “sad and calamitous” situation which they define as “an attack on public health and hygiene due to the critical failures in the refuse collection service.” Tired of the fact that the Council has failed to provide any solutions, AVCRL Asociación de vecinos Cabo Roig y Lomas-Orihuela Costa (AVCRL) has sent a letter to the mayor, Pepe Vegara, in which they warn of legal action “if within a few weeks, before the start of the summer season, the service is not functioning satisfactorily.” They also attached a hundred photos, all taken within the last two months, showing “the serious deficiencies” with which the service is being provided, especially over bank holidays and weekends, with up to four days of delay in the emptying many of the overflowing containers. Thus, they argue that “the City of Orihuela is failing to comply with its obligations under the rules regarding waste collection and road cleaning in Orihuela Costa, generating serious public health and hygiene problems.” But, unfortunately, this is not new. This same situation has been denounced on many previous occasions by residents, “but still the Department of Street Cleaning and MSW has failed to adopt measures to provide the service, comply with its obligations, allocate adequate public resources that residents are charged for with their SUMA.” In April, municipal sources said that “garbage was being collected normally, except for those occasions that were caused by breakdowns of trucks.” Beyond the problems generated by an old fleet, the association’s letter points out that “the service is sadly lacking, poorly planned and does not have the necessary human, technical and material resources,” noting that this in turn “generates a negative impact on the area and decreases the income of commercial and tourist operations, causing loss of profits.” AVCRL insists that the ineffectiveness of the council shows “a clear disregard toward the resolutions handed down and a collective and illegal abandonment of this public service.” Without going further, they continue, “many streets of Orihuela Costa, especially in the interior area, are full of rubble at the moment, illegally deposited and without any control, because the councillor of Road Cleaning and RSU has failed to have them cleared away for more than four months, despite the appeals that the residents have been repeatedly made.” The letter asks the mayor to force the authorities and public officials of the Department of Road Cleaning and RSU and the Councillor of Orihuela Costa to provide the service normally. It also requests , in addition information regarding planning for the financial year 2024 and the list of technical and human resources available – and specifically for the summer period – as well as the recruitment plan.",

        "content": "VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran's attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to have economic sanctions that were imposed over the country's controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing the program down. The program — as all matters of state in Iran — are under the guidance of Iran’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and likely won’t change after last week's helicopter crash that killed Iran's president and foreign minister. The IAEA report comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Israel and Iran have also carried out direct strikes on each other’s territories for the first time last month. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report by the U.N. watchdog in February . Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. According to the report, Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium at the current moment stands at 6,201.3 kilograms (1,3671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1,489.8 pounds) since the International Atomic Energy Agency's previous report. IAEA’s definition says that around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further, to 90%. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi , has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. Under the original nuclear deal with world powers, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. In an effort to ensure Iran could not develop atomic weapons, world powers struck a deal with Tehran in 2015 under which it agreed to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for generating nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At the time, U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. The report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar IAEA inspectors from further monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.” According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran's decision to bar inspectors — and a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.” The IAEA report also said that the deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA's talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. Iran has suggested that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran “be continued in Tehran ‘on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon’,” the report said. The report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA's years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. It said the IAEA’s request need to be resolved, otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations\" under the deal. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA stated that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.”",

        "content": "MLA Joe Hargrave at a previous event. (Herald file photo) Prince Albert Carlton will have a new MLA following the next election after Joe Hargrave announced he would not seek re-election. Hargrave made the announcement Monday morning. He was originally acclaimed as the PA Carlton candidate in November 2023. “My family and I have given this a lot of consideration and have decided I just can’t commit to another four years as MLA,” Hargrave said in a statement. “I want to thank my family, friends, and most importantly, the constituents of Prince Albert Carlton for your support over the past eight years. It has been an honour to serve you and to serve with Premier Moe and all my caucus colleagues.” The Saskatchewan Party said it would nominate a new candidate “in the coming weeks.” Hargrave was the owner/operator of Riverside Auto Group in Prince Albert and served as a manager with BMO for 20 years before entering provincial politics. He was first elected in the 2016 provincial election, then re-elected in 2020. Hargrave served in a number of portfolios during his time in office, most recently as Minister of SaskBuilds and Procurement and Minister responsible for the GTH and Provincial Archives of Saskatchewan. He also served as Minister of Highways before resigning the position in 2021 following complaints about a trip he took to California to prepare to sell a piece of property during the COVID-19 outbreak. The Saskatchewan Party has 28 of 48 candidates nominated. Hargrave is the 14th sitting Sask. Party MLA who is not seeking re-election. -Advertisement-",

        "content": "There was nothing that could’ve gotten her to do more “tool time.” Patricia Richardson, who starred in “Home Improvement” as family matriarch Jill Taylor, shared that she used the large pay gap between her and Tim Allen to get out of shooting another season of the hit ABC show. The 73-year-old made it clear at the time that Season 8, which they filmed in 1998, would be her last. “I told everybody, there’s not enough money in the world to get me to do a ninth year. This show is over. It needs to end,” she told the LA Times . According to the outlet, both Richardson and Allen, 70, agreed that it was time to end the beloved show — but ABC made an offer to get them both to come back for a a 25-episode ninth season. The network offered $1 million per episode for Richardson and $2 million per episode for Allen, and, according to Richardson, Allen was all for accepting the offer. Richardson claimed she countered, telling the network that she’d stay if they agreed to pay her the same $2 million per episode that Allen was offered. “I knew that Disney would in no way pay me that much. That was my way to say ‘no’ and was a little bit of a flip-off to Disney,” she said. “I’d been there all this time, and they never even paid me a third of what Tim was making, and I was working my ass off. I was a big reason why women were watching.” As she expected, the offer was turned down, resulting in the show ending in 1999 with Season 8. But this series of events led to tension between her and her co-star. “I was mad at Tim because he was leaving me alone being the only person saying no, which made me feel terrible and like the bad guy,” she said, “and he was upset with me for leaving.” The Post has reached out to Allen’s rep for comment. “Home Improvement” co-creator and executive producer Carmen Finestra, meanwhile, told the LA Times that he couldn’t “remember one discussion” about continuing the show without Richardson. “It just couldn’t have worked,” he said. Executive producer Elliot Shoenman added, “Without her, it just didn’t make any sense.” Allen and Richardson reportedly don’t keep in touch, but the pair reunited in 2015 to film two episodes of his series “Last Man Standing.” She praised his talent to the Times and said she “never stopped loving working with him.” Richardson also recently responded to Allen’s claims that the entire “Home Improvement” cast was on board for a reboot, saying she was never asked about the possibility. “It was so weird. I would hear he was coming out publicly and saying this stuff about everyone was on board to do a ‘Home Improvement’ reunion, but he never asked me and he never asked [series co-star] Jonathan [Taylor Thomas],” Richardson said on an episode of the “Back to the Best” podcast. “I called Jonathan one day and said, ‘Has he asked you about this?’ He went, ‘No,’ ” she said of Thomas, who played her son Randy on the sitcom. “So why is he saying everyone is on board when he hasn’t talked to you or me?” Richardson said about her conversation with Thomas.",

Even though he has hit game-winners in the playoffs before, he reserved the title, \" ,\" for his backcourt teammate, . \"Unbelievable... That's why they call him 'Mr. fourth quarter.' It's amazing. He's born for this situation. He's born for the clutch situations, so we just give the ball to him.\" Irving and Dončić both scored 33 points in Game 3, but the former saved his best for when the lights shined the brightest down the final stretch. Kyrie Irving Fourth Quarter Game 3 Stats Points 14 FG 5-7 3FG 1-1 Dončić was not too shabby himself, knocking down all three of his shots in the final frame for seven points. Throughout the series, Irving averages 10.3 points on 50 percent shooting from the field, while Dončić puts up nine points on 64.3 percent. This star backcourt has two of the best closers in the NBA, and they are putting on a show in the 2024 playoffs. In Game 2, Irving missed two key free throws inside the final two minutes. Instead of feeling sorry for letting the team down, he from the left corner to make it a one-possession game. Even if Irving makes a mistake, his mentality allows him to recover quickly in the most clutch moments. Irving and Dončić's Leadership Helps Young Mavericks No team has ever lost a playoff matchup after being up 3-0. However, Irving says the Mavericks cannot focus on statistics. They need to come out in Game 4 with the same mentality as the first three contests of the series. When Irving won a championship with the in 2016, was the leader and best player on the squad. The former Duke University guard learned what it took to lead on and off the court from one of the greatest players ever. Now, even though Dončić is the number one option, he and other Dallas players acknowledge throughout their deep playoff run. The Mavericks' stars display humble qualities towards each other. Dončić gave Irving the \"Mr. Fourth Quarter\" title after the former hit a game-winning shot in the previous contest. In an interview on the , Mark Cuban described Irving's perspective regarding Dončić being the first option. Their chemistry is only getting stronger each game they play. Now, Irving and Dončić sit five wins away from an NBA title.",

        "content": "A CAR expert who specialises in modern classics has acquired an iconic set of wheels that he believes is the \"best-kept example in the UK.\" A gorgeously yellow Lotus Elise, described as looking like a \"friendly-faced wasp\", can be bought for less than £30,000 from The Motor Grid - and it's well worth every penny. James Russell, founder of The Motor Grid, a dealership packed full of the very best modern classics , has recently picked up a stunning Lotus Elise S. James, who previously told Sun Motors that the Elise S2 model is an \"underappreciated \" modern classic, believes this example is the best he's ever laid eyes on. Speaking exlusively to us again, he said: \"This isn’t just any Lotus; this is potentially peak Lotus. \"The S2 generation is a masterclass in evolution, taking the already brilliant S1 and refining it to near perfection. \"It’s easier to get into, though still a nightmare to get out of – imagine a car trying to give birth to a human, and you’ll get the idea.\" Despite its almost go-kart-like size and tiny interior, which for some drivers might make it somewhat impractical, James describes the S2 as \"magnificent in every conceivable way.\" He added: \"Under the hood, you’ll find the Toyota VVTL-i engine, a marvel of engineering that combines silkiness with a punch that could floor a heavyweight boxer. \"And the paintwork – oh, the paintwork – it’s a crisp yellow with black accents, making it look like a friendly-faced wasp, ready to sting the dullness out of your life.\" This 111S model, which first came out in 2002 and ran until 2011, packs 156 bhp and can reach a top speed of 130 mph. But to James, this motor is about more than just speed and good looks. He said: \" Driving this S2 isn’t just a pleasure because it’s an Elise S2; it’s a joy because it’ss a time capsule. \"This car feels like it’s been cryogenically frozen and then woken up as a sprightly teenager.\" This might be the best-kept Elise in the UK, I never thought I’d find one, but here it is. According to James, the 15-year-old motor boasts just 23,000 miles on the clock and has barely seen a drop of road water - having been kept in pristine condition. James added: \"It’s barely been run in and hasn’t seen a single drop of road water, doesn’t know what winter feels like, having been coddled away more securely than a hibernating hamster. \"The condition? Immaculate doesn’t even begin to cover it; this might be the best-kept Elise in the UK. “I never thought I’d find one, but here it is. “The steering and gearbox feel as tight and fresh as the day it left the factory. “The power ? All the horses are still firmly in the stable, ready to bolt. “Cosmetically, it’s perfect – no sill damage, no osmosis on the paint. It’s baffling why the previous owner didn’t drive it more.\" James has previously urged Sun Motors readers to check out two other modern classics that can be bought for just £10,000 and under - including an iconic Audi model And elsewhere, a much-loved 80s icon that was bought for less than £4,000 by Wheeler Dealers’ host Mike Brewer in a classic episode is now worth eye-watering amount.",

        "content": "Food · Posted 1 minute ago There Are More Than 300 KitKat Flavors In Japan — Here Are The Top 19 You Absolutely Must Try At Least Once Green Tea KitKats are a must. by Jen Shiori Adams BuzzFeed Contributor Link Facebook Pinterest Twitter Mail Japan is one of the biggest food capitals in the world, so it makes sense that they'd have over 300 varieties of KitKats sold in stores across the country. I know that choosing from 300 different flavors might sound a bit overwhelming, so I've tried my best to narrow it down for you. As someone who has tried dozens of KitKat flavors, here are my recommendations for the 19 you need to try at least once: 1. Otona no Amasa Nestlé / Oyatsu Cafe / Via youtube.com It felt necessary to start this list by mentioning that Japan has a line of KitKats that is catered to the mature palettes of grownups. Otona no Amasa literally translates to \"sweetness for adults,\" and it's basically a lower sugar version of the classic KitKats. What's unique about this collection is there are several flavors offered, including dark chocolate, strawberry, matcha, white chocolate, raspberry, and caramel, so if you're not a fan of super sweet chocolates, look no further. 2. Strawberry Nestlé / Grub Exotic / Giphy / Via giphy.com If you love sweet, fruity candies, you'll love these KitKats. The strawberry flavor tastes exactly like the bits you would find in a cereal like Cap'n Crunch's Crunch Berries. The photo above is part of the Otona no Amasa collection so it's a less sweet version, but the classic strawberry flavor is sold in most stores across the country. 3. Sake Nestlé / KitKat Japan / Via kitkatjapan.com I'll admit I was a little hesitant to try sake-flavored KitKats, but they were surprisingly pretty good. The taste of sake is present yet subtle, so even those who don't like the distinct flavor of the rice wine would enjoy it. Plus, the uniqueness of this flavor makes for a great gift to bring back to your friends. 4. Gold Jen Adams Gold KitKats are a combination of the original milk chocolate and caramel-flavored KitKats. Both flavors are already good on their own, but something truly magical happens when you eat the two of them together. 5. Strawberry Short Cake Jen Adams Fun fact: Strawberry short cake is a really popular dessert in Japan because it's red and white, like the Japanese flag. Interesting, right? These KitKats are made of white chocolate swirled with freeze-dried strawberry bits, sandwiched in between wafers and a layer of sweet cream. Compared to the classic strawberry-flavored KitKats, they're a little more tart (from the freeze-dried strawberry pieces). But don't worry, the tartness balances out perfectly from the sweetness of the white chocolate. 6. Chocolate Orange Jen Adams Whoever invented chocolate orange-flavored KitKats needs an immediate raise because these are delicious. I was honestly a little shocked at how much I liked these; chocolate and oranges don't really sound like the best combination. But apparently, these KitKats taste like Terry's chocolate orange candies that are sold in the UK, although I've never tried those, so I can't confirm or deny. 7. Cookies & Cream Nestlé / Yami Buy / Via yamibuy.com If you've ever tried a Hershey's Cookies 'n' Creme Bar , you'll know how delicious the flavors of white chocolate and cookies can be. Now, imagine that with an added wafer in the middle, and you have a Cookies & Cream KitKat. Definitely a must-try for those who love chocolates on the sweeter side. 8. Ume Nestlé / Grub Exotic / Giphy / Via giphy.com Ume-flavored KitKats are a seasonal spring treat. If you aren't familiar with Ume, it's a Japanese plum that's usually pickled, dried, or fermented before eating. I'll admit, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when I tried these for the first time, but they had an interesting flavor for sure. They're sweet, tangy, and just one of those weird flavors you have to try at least once. 9. Apple Pie Nestlé / Japan Candy Store / Via japancandystore.com Another seasonal flavor that's only available in the fall is apple pie. Think of the dessert's cinnamon-y sweetness, and now imagine that in chocolate form. It's amazing. 10. Café Latte Nestlé / Rocket Fizz Lancaster / Via rocketfizzlancasterca.com If you used to be obsessed with mocha Frappucinos like I was, you have to try these. 11. Lucky Red & White Jen Adams Lucky Red & Whites are a combination of white chocolate and milk chocolate KitKats. While that might not sound super exciting or relevant to their name, here's a quick ✨sociology lesson✨: In the late '90s, KitKat Japan gained popularity with students after branding themselves as the \"antidote\" to stress and anxiety during final exam season. So, from a consumer perspective, these little chocolates have been associated with good luck for a long time. Plus, the Japanese pronunciation of KitKat (Kittokatto) sounds almost identical to a Kyushu dialect term, Kittokatsutoo, meaning \"you will definitely win.\" These things prompted KitKat to come out with the Lucky Red & White KitKats. There's a little red and white knot symbol on its packaging, which symbolizes good luck in Japanese culture. Each of these individually wrapped KitKats have a different good luck omen on them, so they make for a special snack. 12. Hojicha Tea Nestlé / KitKat Japan / Via kitkatjapan.com If you love the taste of Matcha KitKats, I would highly recommend giving the Hojicha-flavored ones a try. Hojicha and matcha are both green teas, but their preparation styles are different, which gives them their own distinct flavors. Hojicha tastes a lot nuttier, so it tastes really nice as a KitKat. 13. Wasabi Nestlé / Tokyo Lens / Via youtube.com Wasabi-flavored KitKats might not be the first thing that comes to mind when it comes to dessert, but — as the saying goes — don't knock it 'til you try it. The spiciness of the Wasabi is only subtle and definitely not potent enough to clear your sinuses. 14. Matcha Tiramisu Nestlé / Grub Exotic / Giphy / Via giphy.com I've personally never actually tried this flavor, but I have no doubts that this KitKat would heal something in me. The description calls out the perfectly balanced flavors of mascarpone cheese and bittersweet matcha, which sounds amazing. BRB, filing this under my list of reasons I need to go to Japan this summer. 15. Rum Raisin Nestlé / TheJapanChannelDCom / Via youtube.com Like Rum Raisin ice cream , but in chocolate form. 16. Whole Wheat Biscuit Nestlé / PapiEats / Via youtube.com If you take anything away from this list, let it be about how underrated this flavor is. Whole Wheat Biscuit KitKats are inspired by the taste of English digestive biscuits, and they're coated with a sweet white chocolate. The wafers are made from whole wheat flour and toasted grains. What's interesting is this flavor was created to encourage more healthy grains into people's diets. 17. Milk Tea Jen Adams Another British-inspired flavor, Milk Tea KitKats are the perfect dessert to bring to your next tea party. The black tea extract and white chocolate really balance each other out, so you get a nice, subtle tea flavor. 18. Sweet Potato Nestlé / KitKat Japan / Via kitkatjapan.com These KitKats are inspired by Yaki-imo (roasted sweet potato), which is a pretty common snack in Japan. They kind of remind me of the taste of roasted chestnuts; they're a little nutty yet still pretty sweet. Definitely worth a try. 19. And finally, Umeshu (Plum Wine) Nestlé / KitKat Japan / Via kitkatjapan.com Last but not least, we have Umeshu, or plum wine. Yes, they're a little similar to the Ume KitKats mentioned earlier, but the plum flavor is more mellow in this. Both flavors are good, but this one is better for those who aren't fans of strong fruity flavors.

        "description": "Three people will receive honorary degrees, and two others will be named Fellows of the University at convocation ceremonies this week.",
        "content": "THUNDER BAY — When Lakehead University marks the achievements of nearly 2,000 graduates at its Thunder Bay campus later this week, it will also recognize five individuals for their unique contributions to their fields and to their communities. Lakehead announced Monday that it will confer honorary degrees on Rosie Mosquito, Dr. Samantha Nutt and Patricia Ningewance Nadeau, and will name two other people Fellows of the University. Honorary degree recipients: Rosie Mosquito, a member of Bearskin Lake First Nation, has devoted her life to community development, political advocacy and the advancement of Indigenous rights. In 1986, she became the first female chief in the western part of Nishnawbe Aski Nation. The university stated in its announcement that she has navigated the intricacies of government throughout her career, leveraging her expertise to champion Indigenous causes. She served as executive director of NAN from 1994 to 1996, and has held other pivotal roles including senior policy advisor to the Ontario Regional Chief and executive director of Oshki Wenjack Education Training Institute from 2004 to 2018. One of her proudest accomplishments is the passing of the Indigenous Institutes Act in 2017, provincial legislation that was negotiated during the nine years she chaired the Indigenous Institute Consortium. Mosquito remains an active participant in NAN, with the Chiefs of Ontario and with the Assembly of First Nations. Dr. Samantha Nutt is an award-winning humanitarian, bestselling author and founder and president of War Child U.S.A. and War Child Canada. The university said she has worked for over two decades with children and their families on the frontlines of many international crises, including in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone and Darfur, Sudan. Dr. Nutt is a leading authority on public health, war, international aid and foreign policy, and is an acclaimed public speaker in North America. She is also a staff physician at Women's College Hospital in Toronto, and an assistant professor at the University of Toronto. She previously received the Order of Canada, the country's highest civilian honour. The university stated that her international work has benefited millions of war-affected children. Patricia Ningewance Nadeau (Waabibizhikiikwe) is Bear Clan from Lac Seul First Nation and a survivor of the residential school system.

        "content": "PARIS (Reuters) - Rafael Nadal exited what could be his last French Open to an outpouring of love and support with a first-round defeat by Alexander Zverev, wishing to be back at Roland Garros for the Paris 2024 Olympics. \"I hope to see you again, but I don't know,\" Nadal told an ecstatic crowd after his straight-sets loss on Monday. \"There's a big percentage I will not be back here but I am not 100% sure. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that motivates me.\" It will the third time since his debut at Roland Garros in 2005, that Nadal, whose body has been martyred by 23 years of professional tennis and who left the tournament with a crushed foot after his record-improving 14th title two years ago, does not get to celebrate his June 3 birthday in Paris. The French, who tend to arrive on court Philippe Chatrier fashionably late on the back of a long lunch, skipped coffee and digestif to fill the arena before the king, racket in hand as usual, stepped onto the court to deafening roars. Spain's Nadal stuck to his routine, avoiding the lines and crossing them with his right foot, sprinting to the baseline during warm-up and positioning his two bottles diagonally aimed at the court. On a rainy day in Paris, organisers closed the roof, adding to the intimacy of the moment. On a court he knows like no one else, Nadal struggled to find his mark early on, netting a routine drop shot and serving a double fault to give Zverev the opening game. The German, who after winning the Rome Masters was the worst possible draw for Nadal, kept his foot on the gas pedal to take the first set even if the Mallorcan showed glimpses of his best with a couple of spinning forehand winners down the line. As soon as Zverev eased the pressure, however, Nadal converted his first break point to take a 3-2 lead in the second set. \"Rafa! Rafa!\" went the crowd, again, as world number ones Iga Swiatek and Novak Djokovic, as well as fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, joined the party. Nadal served for the set but Zverev levelled and forced a tiebreak, which he comfortably won. There was another break for Nadal in the third set, and some 'I-can-still-do-it' fist pumps after a few jaw-dropping winners, but two years after Zverev left their semi-final match on a wheelchair with a broken foot, the German was too good this time. There was a sense of anticipation on the morning of the Nadal v Zverev clash as Swiatek, gunning for a fourth title here, kicked off her campaign with a 6-1 6-2 demolition of French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean. Swiatek has now won her last 15 matches in Paris following her back-to-back wins in 2022 and 2023. Coco Gauff also made a strong start, dispatching German Julia Avdeeva 6-1 6-1 for her 50th Grand Slam match victory. The 20-year-old American, who won the U.S. Open last year to break her Grand Slam duck, is looking to claim her first French Open title after losing the 2022 final in Paris. In the men's draw, Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, seeded second, barely broke sweat as he downed American Chris Eubanks in straight sets, just like former runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas did with Hungarian journeyman Marton Fucsovics.

        "content": "KOCHI: On the 30th, the High Court will again consider the case filed by the former employees of the State Warehousing Corporation demanding their rightful pension. The case is being considered for the 100th time. The petitioners, aged up to 85 years, have been in a legal battle for 23 years. A petition filed in the High Court in 2001, seeking pension payment received a favourable response only when the case was considered in 2010. The corporation approached the Supreme Court against this with a petition but was dismissed in 2017. However, the court order remained unimplemented. At this stage, the pensioners filed a contempt petition in the Supreme Court. The petition was withdrawn after the corporation announced that the court verdict would be implemented immediately, but the pension hike was still not implemented. The pensioners then approached the Supreme Court but the petition was referred to the High Court. The High Court ruled that a minimum of Rs 5,000 and a maximum of Rs 15,500 including dearness allowance till April 1, 2018, should be paid. The court back then also ordered the corporation to complete all dues till then within three months. The High Court will now consider the appeal filed in the Corporation Division Bench and the petition of the pensioners. 45 pensioners died during the legal battle while 603 are still hoping for a favorable result.",

        "content": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Efforts to reduce the availability of alcohol in the state on one side. Measures to increase the number of bars on the other. 801 bars at present. 14 new applications in various districts under scrutiny. 97 bar licenses were issued after the second Pinarayi government came to power. UDF had shut down all but 29 five-star hotels in 2016 before leaving. Four-star bars among the closed bars were allowed to function as per the decision of the left government. 200 new licenses were also granted. By the end of the Left government's term in 2021, the number of bars reached 671. Now there are 801 bars, including those licensed by raising the classification and new ones. High profit business The constant argument of the bar owners is that there is no loss-making business like the bar business. However, even a normal bar has an average daily sales of Rs.1.5 to Rs.2 lakh. Depending on the quality of the bar and the speciality of the location, it can go up to five or six lakhs. 15 to 20 percent of the sale goes to the owner's pocket after all expenses including the share of license fee. Common man's favourite Jawan rum is priced at Rs 640 per litre at Bevco Shop. Jawan rum is sold at bars at peg rate. Rs 65 per peg is the minimum rate. One litre is 16.5 pegs. A litre of Jawan rum is sold for Rs 1072.50. Profit from this is Rs.432. Depending on the quality of the bars, the peg rate can increase and so can the profit. A typical bar sells 750 to 850 pegs of Jawan rum a day. As the price of liquor increases, the peg rate and profit will rise. Burden of donation Owners get amazing profits but donation is a burden. Bar owners have to donate huge sums of money to major political parties during elections. The amount determined will be collected from each bar and handed over by the owners association. Earlier it was up to 25,000, 50,000, now it has become lakhs. Contribution to local leaders is on top of this.",

The disciplinary action against Sabu is amid his retirement from the police force on May 31. Thammanam Faizal organized the feast on May 26 at his residence in Puliyanam in Angamaly. Faizal's house and premises were under the surveillance of cops. After receiving intel, Rural Police chief Vaibhav Saxena instruced Angamaly SI to check out the place. The sub inspector reached the place while Sabu was feasting with Faizal. On seeing the official, Sabu hid in a bathroom. Faizal told the SI that the other two cops are his workers. All three were taken to the police station, where it was revealed that the other two with Faizal are cops and they came with the DySP. However, Sabu told the Alappuzha police chief that he was at his residence during this time. On checking the call details of the police officers, it became clear that didn't contact Faizal, who testified that the said DySP didn't come and there was no feast. Jollymon, a driver of Alappuzha Police special branch, and CK Deepak, a CPO, were suspended for visiting the goonda leader's house.",

        "description": "Flashing your lights to let other drivers know of police speed camera vans may seem considerate, but is not looked on kindly by road authorities and can land Brits with a £1,000 fine",
        "content": "Motorists flashing headlights at approaching drivers often means one thing - police camera vans ahead. But doing so risks landing you a hefty rule, due to a little-known rule. The heads up over speed camera vans isn't looked on kindly by police, and is actually considered an offence. A surprising 40% of people were unaware of the rule, while 20% confessed to doing it in the past. Those found guilty could face a nasty £1,000 fine. Virgin Media offers gamers the chance to get £250 but you'll need to act quickly While some drivers might question the harm, the police aims to observe natural road conditions - especially at known speeding hotspots where safety issues may have been flagged. Other frowned-upon behaviours involving flashing headlights include intimidating other drivers, such as when approaching in the outside lane of a motorway, reports Birmingham Live . Rule 110 of the Highway Code explicitly states: \"Only flash your headlights to let other road users know that you are there. Do not flash your headlights to convey any other message or intimidate other road users.\" In areas notorious for parking issues, police are often vigilant as numerous drivers fall foul of this rule. Nick Powell from the AA stressed the significance of being conversant with the Highway Code: \"It's important that every driver is fully aware of the Highway Code, to ensure they keep themselves, and others, safe while on the roads. A lack of understanding from even one driver can impact the safety of every other vehicle, cyclist, and pedestrian they share the road with, as well as the people or pets they might have in their car.\" He also recommended motorists to regularly brush up on their knowledge of traffic laws: \"Motorists should take the time to refresh their knowledge of traffic rules and regulations, no matter how long they're been driving, and should also avoid any common mistakes, such as speeding or swearing at other motorists. \"Drivers are accountable for the safety of all their passengers too, so they need to ensure they don't overfill the vehicle, that any pets are secured, and that every single person is wearing a seatbelt.\"",

        "description": "The move by Spain, Norway and Ireland signals a significant shift in Europe against Israel’s excesses in Gaza",
        "content": "Home | Editorials | Editorial Growing Isolation Of Israel Editorial: Growing isolation of Israel The move by Spain, Norway and Ireland signals a significant shift in Europe against Israel’s excesses in Gaza By Telangana Today Published Date - 27 May 2024, 11:45 PM Benjamin Netanyahu The decision by Spain, Norway and Ireland to recognise an independent Palestinian state is yet another testimony to the strengthening international opinion in favour of a permanent two-state solution to the vexed conflict. The move also reflects increasing public outrage over an unjust war being carried out by Israel on Gaza leading to massive devastation and civilian death toll. With over 140 countries in the world, including India, coming out in support of the Palestinian cause, Israel is facing international isolation at a level never seen in the past for its military offensive that violates all norms. This is reminiscent of the isolation that South Africa’s apartheid regime faced in the 1980s. One hopes that the latest assertion by the Western European nations would bolster the Palestinian cause and provide a fillip to the efforts towards a two-state solution, where both Israel and Palestine can peacefully co-exist together. The far-right regime in Tel Aviv has been expanding settlements in the occupied West Bank and is continuing to bombard Gaza without either toppling Hamas or bringing home all its hostages. The closely coordinated announcements by Spain, Norway and Ireland, signal a significant shift in Europe against Israel’s excesses in Gaza, widely condemned as genocidal. Notably, Norway, a key player in the Oslo Accords of 1993, has emphasised that recognising Palestine is crucial for peace in West Asia, asserting that a two-state solution is in Israel’s best interest. Ireland and Spain have echoed this sentiment, underscoring the need to break the cycle of violence that has worsened since the October 7 attack by Hamas and the subsequent Israeli counter-assaults. The latest recognition is an act of powerful political and symbolic value and comes close on the heels of the International Criminal Court issuing arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and three Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes. With the International Court of Justice hearing South Africa’s appeal to stop Israel’s attacks in Rafah, the global clamour for accountability and justice is growing. Hopefully, these developments will inspire other Western countries to follow suit and step up international pressure for a permanent ceasefire and meaningful negotiations to find a lasting solution. The growing support for a Palestinian state among European nations is a huge straw in the wind that will grow into a hurricane if Israel does not change course. Tel Aviv, on the other hand, contends that the establishment of a Palestinian state would pose an existential threat to Israel. On its part, India has been maintaining a consistent policy, advocating for direct negotiations to establish a sovereign, independent Palestine coexisting peacefully with Israel. It has reiterated its long-standing support for a two-state solution, though Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s tweet condemning the initial Hamas attack was interpreted by some observers as a shift in the country’s stance.

Puskar) ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list on Monday after the reigning NL MVP sustained a season-ending torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. Acuña was hurt in the Braves' 8-1 win at Pittsburgh on Sunday. After opening the game with a double, Acuña started toward third on a stolen base attempt. His left knee gave way when he stopped in an attempt to return to second base. Atlanta announced Sunday night an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require surgery. Acuña tore his right ACL on July 20, 2021 . He returned on April 28, 2022, after missing Atlanta's first 19 games of the season. Atlanta has lost two top players to season-ending injuries in the first two months of the season. All-Star right-hander Spencer Strider's season ended on April 13 when he had internal brace surgery to repair the ulnar collateral ligament in his pitching elbow. Acuña's injury came just as the Braves were looking forward to having two starters return to their lineup. Third baseman Austin Riley and catcher Sean Murphy started in Monday's game against Washington. Riley missed two weeks with tightness in his left side and Murphy had been out with a strained left oblique since March 30. “There are few players in this league that are on a level he is,” Riley said. “It's a joy to watch him every night and to have that happen, you feel for him.” Riley said he and other key players “are going to have to step up and pull our full weight. He'll be missed for sure.” The Braves have won six straight NL East titles and won the 2021 World Series as Acuña was rehabbing from his first season-ending injury. The Braves entered Monday's games in second place in the division, six games behind Philadelphia. “We have more than 100 games left and we're 10 games over .500,” Murphy said. “We're still in a great spot. I don't think there's any reason to be worried about the Atlanta Braves.” Even so, Murphy added “I don't think there's anyone else in the big leagues who could just step in and do what Ronald does.” Manager Brian Snitker chose second baseman Ozzie Albies as the team's new leadoff hitter. Jared Kelenic and Adam Duvall, who have been sharing time in left field, each started against the Nationals. Duvall replaced Acuña in right field and Kelenic started in left field. “You hate it,” said Snitker of Acuña's injury. “It's part of it. You try to look at it that now we're going to give somebody a chance to do something special in his absence. ... Jared is going to get some regular at-bats. I think he's ready to take that next step.” Snitker said “I feel worse for the kid than for us that he has to go through this again.” Acuña was voted the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases, becoming the first player to have at least 40 homers and 70 steals in a season. The 26-year-old from Venezuela was hitting .250 with four homers, 15 RBIs and 16 steals this season. The Braves recalled outfielder J.P. Martinez from Triple-A Gwinnett and infielder Joey Wendle was designated for assignment. Martinez will be the fourth outfielder. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb Charles Odum, The Associated Press See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

        "content": "Portuguese international footballer Cristiano Ronaldo could not stop securing a new set of recognition as his Al Nassr are set to conclude the Saudi Pro League playing its last match with Al Ittehad Monday. The 39-year-old star joined the Saudi club in January 2023, after signing a contract for two-and-a-half years. As the Saudi Pro League comes to its end, with Al Hilal winning the title, Cristiano Ronaldo is set to become the top scorer of this season with 33 goals on his name. This recognition is expected to be formally given at the end of Al Nassr's game with Al Ittehad at King Abdullah Sports City. Cristiano Ronaldo is not only finishing this season with Saudi Arabia but the forward holds the record for the highest number of goals in the UEFA Champions League. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner is in high spirits to complete the number of 900 goals as he was just 9 nets away from writing his name into the books of football history as the best player. His total tally is 891. He is also at the top of the list of the best international football players ahead of Pele, Lionel Messi and many more with 128 strikes under his name.",

        "content": "The Attorney-General of Federation ( AGF) and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi, SAN has called for crucial reforms and enhanced cooperation within the judiciary across West African nations. The AGF made the call at the opening ceremony of the Statutory Meeting of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in Abuja, which had judicial leaders from the sub-region. Fagbemi commended the Chief Justices and judicial representatives from various ECOWAS member states for their vital roles in the administration of justice. He noted the shared challenges faced by national courts, including issues of judicial autonomy, funding, and infrastructure, and urged the council to use this regional platform to address these concerns collectively. “The challenges confronting the judiciary or the justice system in general across the States are identical,” Fagbemi noted. “I therefore humbly enjoin your Lordships to utilize this regional platform, as an avenue for peer review and cross-fertilization of ideas, to achieve greater independence of the judiciary, a more prosperous and safer sub-region.” Fagbemi also advocated for a reform-oriented review of the practice and procedure of the ECOWAS Court of Justice to mitigate conflicts with national courts and enhance the court’s effectiveness as a regional judicial body. The Attorney-General emphasized the judiciary’s role in promoting the rule of law and democratic governance, especially in light of recent pressures on these principles. He called on the judiciary to help prevent military incursions into governance by ensuring adherence to free and fair elections and constitutional governance. “As the ECOWAS block continues to work towards achieving uniform economic policies and institutions, the judiciary should not be left behind,” Fagbemi said. He proposed that the ECOWAS Judicial Council foster a credible network for promoting uniform rules of practice and procedure, thus reducing legal conflicts across the region. Notable judicial figures at the opening ceremony included the Chief Justices of Nigeria, Olukayode Ariwoola, and that of Cabo Verde, Cote d’Ivoire, Benin, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, as well as representatives from Senegal and Togo, and the President of the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice. The meeting is aimed at enhancing judicial collaboration in addressing regional challenges and promoting the rule of law, economic integration, and democratic governance in West Africa.

        "content": "A CLEANING expert has revealed the five most neglected items and spots even the most thorough cleaners may miss. The overlooked (and often filthy) spots in your home may require special attention. Deyan Dimitrov, a cleaning expert and CEO of Laundryheap , shared the tidy tips. He explained that although people tend to miss a few household items when tidying up, cleaning them takes only five minutes. One commonly missed kitchen item is the toaster tray. \"Before you begin cleaning your toaster, make sure it's unplugged!\" Dimitrov warned. \"Use a clean, dry toothbrush to clean in and around the bread slots to dislodge any big crumbs. \"Then, empty out the crumb tray and give it a quick wash with washing-up liquid to get rid of any sticky spots. \"Once it’s bone-dry, insert it back into the toaster and shake the whole appliance out over a bin or sink to make sure you get rid of every last crumb. \"Give the outer side of the toaster a quick sponge, and it should be back to looking brand new.\" Other kitchen spots that may need special attention include sauce and spice shelves and the inside of the cutlery drawer. \"I would recommend giving the storage areas of your condiments a thorough clean with surface cleaner and a damp cloth every two weeks to ensure that dirt and grime don’t fester away in hidden areas,\" Dimitrov said. \"Make sure that the shelves are completely dry before you add your bottles and tubs back in to prevent any stickiness.\" The cutlery drawer, he added, should be deep-cleaned every few weeks with a cloth and surface cleaner. A pro tip is to place a small bowl of baking soda in the drawer to remove odor and keep it smelling fresh between cleans. He revealed that a bathroom victim is one who's used to cleaning but is never itself cleaned. Here are some tips to help you when you clean your home next: \"Toilet brushes are often neglected, but they do need to be cleaned regularly,\" he said. \"Fill your toilet brush container with hot, soapy water and a few drops of bleach. Swirl the brush around in the water and let it soak for one minute before emptying the water down the toilet. \"Then, flush clean water over the brush and spray both the container and brush with a disinfectant spray.\" While homeowners may not expect laundry machines to be dirty, Dimitrov explained that washers and dryers can accumulate grime over time, improving their performance. \"For maximum efficiency, it's a good idea to clean out your washing machine and dryer after each cycle,\" he said. \"A lot of lint and hair can accumulate from just one load, hindering your machine from properly drying big and dense items. To clean out your washing machine filter remove any debris or lint buildup, and then rinse it under running water. \"For your dryer, clean the lint trap after every use by removing lint with your hand or a brush and periodically vacuuming the area around [it] to prevent blockages and maintain airflow.\"",

        "content": "Manchester United defender Luke Shaw has revealed he is \"not 100% fit\" despite being named in England's provisional squad for this summer's European Championships. The 28-year-old's inclusion in the Three Lions' initial 33-man squad by manager Gareth Southgate was met with a barrage of criticism due to not featuring for United since February's 2-1 win at Luton Town. In total, the defender has played just 15 times for Erik ten Hag's side this season. Shaw, though, who has been sidelined with a muscle injury, has defended his absence over the last three months and insisted he is \"constantly working\" to be fit, but admitted speculation about his loyalty to United is \"frustrating\". READ MORE: Amrabat and Mainoo great - United player ratings vs City READ MORE: United get a glimpse of a possible new era after stunning City Posting on Instagram on Sunday, Shaw wrote: \"Happy for the boys to lift the trophy at the weekend and finish this season on a positive. As much as it was the result I wanted it was hard to watch from the stands. \"This has definitely been the most frustrating season for me, I have had set back after set back and have worked so hard to get back to fitness but things just haven’t gone my way. I pushed so hard to get back before the end of the season and the final but some things just aren’t meant to be. \"There’s nothing I want to do more than play and win with Manchester United I don’t normally react to things I see on social media but there’s a lot of people questioning my loyalty to this club and asking how I am fit for England but not United. The reality is I am not 100% fit for either right now but I am doing everything I can and constantly working to be. I have been at this club for 10 years through highs and lows and for anyone to question my loyalty is obviously frustrating. \"I appreciate I haven’t updated you all with my injuries and where I’m at with my recovery but equally the most important thing to me is that we’re supporting the team playing. My biggest focus right now is being fit and then whatever happens this summer I will be ready. Thank you for your patience.\" Southgate, who overlooked Shaw's United team-mate Marcus Rashford, will trim England's squad to 26 after friendlies against Iceland and Bosnia and Herzegovina next month.

        "content": "KUWAIT: The Kuwait Society for Smoking and Cancer Prevention (KSSCP) announced the opening of an anti-smoking clinic at the Life Science College of Sabah Al-Salem University City on the occasion of World No Smoking Day. KSSCP board member and treasurer, Dr Hussa Majid Al-Shaheen, in her opening speech, lauded the efforts of the university in completing the clinic. Dr Al-Shaheen spoke about the dangerous harms smoking (of all types) causes, be they physical or psychological, in addition to the social harms. She said the clinic has been successful in assisting smokers and those who want to quit smoking. “The clinic creates an opportunity for those who wish to stop this harmful habit, as youths are the target of the tobacco mafia around the world. The fierce marketing campaign to promote smoking among the young generations through the launch of e-smoking devices and promoting them as means to stop smoking calls for concern because the opposite is true and they are not good for the body,” she added. University Deputy Rector for Planning Asaad Al-Rashid said the opening of the first specialized clinic is the first initiative of this kind at Kuwait University. He appreciated the efforts of all concerned parties to open the clinic on the university campus. This will create awareness about the dangers of smoking. Head of the Health Cities at the Ministry of Health, Dr Amal Al-Yahya, said the opening will prevent smoking in the university city, adding that Sabah Al-Salem University City was approved as a healthy university. Meanwhile, Chairman of the Board of KSSCP, Dr Khalid Al-Saleh, said that treatment of addiction is among the most important strategies of smoking control programs. “Many smokers find it difficult to stop by themselves. They will benefit from the services that are available at the smoking prevention clinics. The goal is to help smokers who wish to stop, create awareness about the dangers of smoking, and dispense medicines that help stop smoking,” he explained.",

        "content": "The devastating losses for wine and some fruit producers in the Okanagan in the past few years has some growers shifting their focus and looking to diversify. At operations like Paynter’s Fruit Market in West Kelowna, Gatzke’s Orchards in Lake Country and McMillan Farms in Kelowna they are banking on vegetables, flowers and other ground crops. “We’re planting so many more musk melons, cantaloupe and watermelons this year, because of the loss of the peaches,” Paynter’s owner/operator Jennay Oliver told Castanet after extreme cold in January wiped out her peaches and apricots. Alan Gatzke said his peach, apricot and cherry crops were also significantly damaged, but because he has a diversified farm, it’s easier to plant more vegetables and other ground crops. Ron McMillan has decided to put in more sunflowers, to supplement his usual crop of pumpkins that has been impacted by heat and cold in recent years. He also considered adding hops to his fields, but couldn't find a reliable buyer. He says climate change has been top of mind for growers in the Okanagan for quite some time. “I think this is a wake-up for people who are non-farmers. I think the farmers have been realizing something has been going on for a while, have been sounding the alarm, but not everybody’s been listening,” McMillan said. Gatzke adds that there’s no doubt in his mind that the weather has been more volatile in the last decade, pointing to the 2021 heat dome and temperatures below -25 over the past two winters. McMillan says growers will have to adapt to the increasingly severe weather events. “One thing you’re going to see is there’s going to be a lot of changes going on as people try to find ways to make this work. “It’s here and we have to adapt and keep trying to do things to keep ahead of it,” he adds. For those who put all their eggs in one basket, finding a new source of revenue will be tougher. The BC Ministry of Agriculture and Food says it’s common practice for producers to diversify to mitigate losses, but ground crops also face challenges developing a sales model and end market for their products. The ministry suggests looking at direct to consumer sales through farmers markets, restaurants and local retailers. Producers looking for information about Ministry support or accessing programs should contact our AgriService BC at 1-888-221-7141 or . Vineyards and fruit growers in BC can tap into a this year to help them grow hardier, climate resistant varieties. It’s anticipated approximately 1,000 producers will access the fund. The ministry is also working with industry associations to develop planting guidelines that position the province to adapt and perform will in the face of the changing climate, pest, disease and market pressures.",

        "content": "The Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru visited the Cocoland Sugar Development Project in Abau, Central province on Sunday. He was received by the chairman of the Yaosoeng Sugar and Cane Consultant Company, Prapat Jenlapwattanakul and his team, the landowners, community leaders, and the people of Cocolands. Mr Maru described his visit as ‘‘a very useful visit’’. After visiting the project site, Mr Maru said: “I do appreciate that there is enough grassland for the project, there is enough State land to build the sugar mill, and the local people are very supportive of this project.” Mr Maru explained the processes that will now follow which include putting together a NEC Submission before the cabinet for endorsement. ‘‘The Cabinet will basically approve that the Government must support this project and it will be developed as an SEZ meaning the company will be given incentives to invest here including tax holiday and duty-free exemptions. ‘‘This is subject to phase two which is negotiations between the company, the landowners, the DDA, the LLGs, the local MP, the Provincial Government, and the State, to agree to the elements of the project like benefits for landowners, new wharf, power supply, etc which will be captured in the project agreement. The project agreement will be signed and subject to the negotiations. ‘‘After the signing of the project agreement, the State will give the land title to the company. ‘‘The company will need the title to have security of land tenure so they can go to the banks to raise capital to build the sugar mill and to start this project. ‘‘The shareholders of this project the State through Kumul Consolidated Holdings, the provincial government, and other investors,” Mr Maru explained. The proposal is for a 40, 000-hectare sugar farm, a processing mill, and a power plant. This follows a successful trial in Abau on the proposed sugar farm land. The plantation will produce 3 million tonnes of sugar every year with the target market to be PNG and other countries, especially Indonesia.",

        "content": "An old letter of recommendation written by Vadgaon Sheri MLA Sunil Tingre, recommending Dr Ajay Taware for the post of Medical Superintendent, Sassoon Hospital, has come back to haunt the MLA as police arrested Dr Taware for his role in allegedly throwing away the blood sample of the juvenile involved in the Porsche crash. The letter was written by Tingre on December 26, 2023 to the Minister for Medical Education and Research Hassan Mushriff and Dr Taware was appointed as the Medical Superintendent in the same year. In his letter, Tingre recommended Dr Taware as personally known to him . “During the Covid-19 crisis he had done commendable work. I request you to take proper steps at your level to appoint him as the Medical Superintendent,” the letter read. Back then, Dr Taware was working as the Head and Professor of the Department of Forensic Science, post which he became the Medical Superintendent. Advertisement Dr Taware was removed twice from his post of Medical Superintendent, once for his alleged role in the kidney transplant racket involving the Ruby Hall Clinic in 2022 and another time in April this year due to the rat bite incident in the hospital. The letter had surfaced when the police had busted the major drug cartel involving Lalit Patil which was allegedly being run from the Sassoon Hospital. Back then, Tingre had said as public representative many people ask for recommendations and he had issued the same. Following the recent incident, the letter has resurfaced again. Mushriff was unable for comment despite repeated calls to him as he was busy in a party meeting in Mumbai . On Monday, Dr Taware and Dr Srihari Harnol were arrested by police for allegedly tampering with the blood sample of the juvenile who was driving the speeding Porsche which killed two software engineers. Police had claimed the blood sample of the juvenile was thrown away in the dustbin and replaced by someone else’s blood sample. The matter came to light when DNA from both the samples did not match.

        "content": "CALGARY — Steve Blake has a powerful message — don’t give up on your dreams no matter what life throws your way. The Calgary golf professional is gearing up for playing in Canada’s lone PGA Tour Champions event of the season while battling inoperable Stage 4 lung cancer. “You may be handed a death sentence, but it doesn’t mean life’s over,” said Blake, whose received the shocking diagnosis in September. “You’ve still got a lot to give, so get out there and give something.” Blake was given a sponsor exemption on Monday, his 56th birthday, to play in his hometown at the 2024 Rogers Charity Classic at Canyon Meadows Golf and Country Club from Aug. 16 to 18. “The more I have something like this tournament coming up to look forward to, the more alive I feel,” Blake said. “I don’t feel like I’m sick. I feel like I’m just this normal guy who’s going to practise for this tournament coming up and hopefully I’ll be around for the next one and so on and so on. “As devastating as something can sound, I think if you believe that you can conquer something, you will, especially if you have good support staff and family (and) friends.” Blake, who also competed at the PGA Tour Champions event in 2018 when the tournament was known as the Shaw Charity Classic, decided to apply for another exemption while in the midst of undergoing eight months of chemotherapy treatments. He is looking forward to playing the sport he loves, possibly alongside fellow Canadians Mike Weir and Stephen Ames. “It’s incredible,” Blake said. “The opportunity, it leaves you speechless obviously to compete again with these guys to be on the same stage. The situation being what it is, they were very open to receive my letter and have me in there.” A non-smoker with an active lifestyle, Blake developed a nagging cough in August. “I made a deal with my wife that if it did get worse that I would go to the hospital,” said Blake. “Long story short, about 16 hours later and my wife had shown up by that time, sitting in emergency going through a bunch of tests and stuff and they came back with the diagnosis.” Blake faced his prognosis from his oncologist with his family by his side. “We knew it wasn’t going to be good,” Blake said. “He said 12 to 24 months, but I kind of really grabbed onto that and said, ‘I just want this to be the starting point. Like, I’ll see you in 24 months and then we’ll discuss another prognosis if you’ve got another one for me.’ “Being able to look forward to something like this does so much for me mentally, physically, everything, just to get me psyched up to come out here and compete again.” The devastating news was a shock to the system for Blake, his wife Kelly and their kids Connor, 25, and Brooklyn, 22, who are both accomplished athletes. “When we told the kids, they were so emotional as well,” said Kelly. “We didn’t know if Steve would be well enough to golf, let alone out here (at Canyon Meadows).” Connor is a defenceman playing hockey for the ECHL’s Adirondack Thunder, while Brooklyn is a midfielder with Calgary Foothills WFC. “I’m always looking for something to take my mind off the illness,” said Blake, who works as a financial adviser. “I’m still trying to be very active in work. I’m still trying to be very active in golf and in my kids’ sports and things like that.” After just missing out on qualifying to compete at the U.S. Senior Open Championship last year, Blake will attempt to earn a spot to play at this year’s tournament to be held at Newport Country Club in Newport, R.I., from June 27 to 30. “Having something like the U.S. Senior Open qualifier to look forward to again, just the idea of being able to go down and compete, is something that’s really special to me and my wife,” said Blake, who will tee it up for a qualifying round at Goose Creek Golf Club in Jurupa Valley, Calif., on Tuesday. “I’m fortunate I’ve played (Goose Creek) a couple times. I was close the last time I was down there. Hopefully, I just make a few more putts and we’ll see if we can get in the U.S. Senior Open again.” Blake played at the major in 2018 at the Broadmoor Golf Club in Colorado Springs, Col. Although he missed the cut with rounds of 79 and 74, it gave him confidence that he could hold his own against the likes of World Golf Hall of Fame members Vijay Singh and Bernhard Langer. “It’s just such a great opportunity to come out and compete with them,” said Blake, who carded rounds of 70, 77 and 71 six years ago at Canyon Meadows to finish well back of winner Scott McCarron. “It’ll be a little different than the last time. It’ll be similar as far as having family and friends and the crowd around, which I so enjoy having. “I know in 2018, it was let’s just not embarrass myself while I’m out here too much. It will be different, just playing for something maybe just a little bit bigger than me. I hope people see the message and see that somebody with an illness like this can still get out there and still pursue their dreams.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.

        "content": "Bill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies at 71 Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced on behalf of his family that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. 14-time champion Rafael Nadal loses in the French Open's first round to Alexander Zverev PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal has lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The capacity crowd of about 15,000 was mostly cheering for Nadal. He has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he is not 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. Kyle Larson's bid to run The Double ends in disappointment after bad weather intervenes CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only the single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s goal to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday and join Tony Stewart as only drivers to complete all 1,100 laps did not go nearly as planned. He finished 18th at Indianapolis after a pair of rookie mistakes. He arrived in Charlotte to run the NASCAR race but never got to turn a lap after the race was ended early because of rain. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving each score 33 points as Mavs beat Wolves for 3-0 lead in West finals DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving scored 33 points apiece and the Dallas Mavericks made all the big plays late again, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-107 for a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference finals. The Mavericks went on a 14-3 run to finish the game, winning their fifth consecutive playoff game. No team in NBA playoff history has rallied from 3-0 down. Game 4 is Tuesday night in Dallas. Anthony Edwards had 26 points for the Wolves, but just four after scoring eight consecutive Minnesota points to get the Wolves even in the third quarter. Braves' Ronald Acuña is placed on IL after second season-ending knee injury in 4 years ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves have placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list after the reigning NL MVP tore his left ACL, ending his season. Acuña was hurt during the Braves’ 8-1 win at Pittsburgh on Sunday. The Braves announced Sunday night an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require surgery. Acuña tore his right ACL in July 2021. Acuña was voted the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases. Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris played Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev and lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. Wennberg scores in OT, Rangers top Panthers 5-4 to take lead in East finals SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Alex Wennberg deflected home a goal 5:35 into overtime, and the New York Rangers reclaimed home-ice advantage in the Eastern Conference finals with a 5-4 win over the Florida Panthers in Game 3 on Sunday. Ryan Lindgren took a shot from the left point and Wennberg — in front of the Florida net — redirected it past Sergei Bobrovsky to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead in the series. Igor Shesterkin made 33 stops, while Alexis Lafrenière scored two goals and Barclay Goodrow continued his surprising playoff barrage with two more scores for the Rangers. Sam Reinhart had two power-play goals, while Aleksander Barkov and Gustav Forsling also scored for the Panthers. Christopher Bell wins the rain-shortened Coca-Cola 600 for his 8th NASCAR Cup victory CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Christopher Bell won the Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday at Charlotte Motor Speedway after the race was called with 151 laps remaining in a race that was halted for more than two hours because of rain. Bell led a race-high 90 laps to win his eighth career Cup Series race, and his first Coca-Cola 600. Brad Keselowski finished second, William Byron was third, Tyler Reddick was fourth and Denny Hamlin rounded out the top five. The race was red-flagged just as Kyle Larson arrived at Charlotte Motor Speedway from the Indianapolis 500 to take over driving the Hendrick Motorsports’ No. 5 Chevrolet. As Dallas competes for NBA and NHL crowns, the Texas Rangers are struggling with their title defense The Texas Rangers host the Arizona Diamondbacks this week in a rematch of last year’s World Series. Both teams are under .500, costing the matchup some of its luster. For the Rangers, injuries to prominent starting pitchers are just part of the problem. Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer haven’t pitched at all this year. Nathan Eovaldi and Jon Gray are on the injured list now as well. Despite all that, Texas’ starters have an ERA of 3.65. But the bullpen has the second-worst ERA in the game at 5.09.",

        "content": "The makers of Bollywood star Salman Khan’s Sikandar have reportedly roped in a Baahubali actor to play the role of the villain in the film. Directed by AR Murugadoss, Sikandar is set to release next year as Salman Khan will begin shooting for the movie in June, an Indian media outlet reported. As rumours intensified about the villain of the movie, producer Chithra Laksmanan has said that South star Sathyaraj will play the villain in Sikandar. Laksmanan in an interview said that Sathyaraj, who played the role of Kattappa in Baahubali, will be up as villain against Khan in Sikandar. The actor has also confirmed the news himself in a recent interview and said that he is the villain in Salman Khan’s film. Read more: Anil Kapoor to replace Salman Khan as Bigg Boss host?

I am truly grateful and honoured to be a part of #Sikandar,” she wrote. Earlier, reports suggested that Salman Khan insisted on doing the action scenes himself and modified his workout regimen to develop a chiseled physique.

        "description": "The full music video is expected to drop June 7",
        "content": "Ariana Grande debuted an unsettling teaser Monday for “The Boy is Mine,” the eighth track on her latest album Eternal Sunshine . In the 10-second clip posted to Instagram, a man turns on a faucet and plunges his face in the sink, as a grisly hand with opaque claws pries open the door. The full music video, expected to be released on June 7, comes after music videos for “We Can’t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)” and hit track “Yes, And?” came out earlier this year. All three tracks are off her seventh album, which released March 8. The “We Can’t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)” video, which came out on the album-release day, draws references to the 2004 film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , as Grande’s character begins a procedure that erases all memories of her ex. However, “The Boy is Mine” teaser has darker undertones. A post shared by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) “The Boy is Mine,” which fed online rumors around her relationship with Ethan Slater (former lead in the Broadway musical Spongebob Squarepant s), has an R&B-pop sound and shares the same name with the 1998 Brandy and Monica track. In a March interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music, Grande said she “always wanted to reimagine” the 1998 track that topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 13 weeks. In a Rolling Stone review , Grande’s Eternal Sunshine album was described as “a gorgeously exposed journey to the end of her world — or at least what she believes to be the end. It’s a divorce album that goes through all the stages of grief, and the singer navigates a new beginning with some of the most honest and inventive songs of her career so far.” On the horizon, Grande will star in the novel-turned-musical-turned- film adaptation of Wicked as Glinda, Good Witch of the East, alongside Cynthia Erivo as the Wicked Witch of the West, set to release Nov. 27.",

        "content": "ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list on Monday after the reigning NL MVP sustained a season-ending torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. Acuña was hurt in the Braves' 8-1 win at Pittsburgh on Sunday. After opening the game with a double, Acuña started toward third on a stolen base attempt. His left knee gave way when he stopped in an attempt to return to second base. Atlanta announced Sunday night an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require surgery. Acuña tore his right ACL on July 20, 2021 . He returned on April 28, 2022, after missing Atlanta's first 19 games of the season. Atlanta has lost two top players to season-ending injuries in the first two months of the season. All-Star right-hander Spencer Strider's season ended on April 13 when he had internal brace surgery to repair the ulnar collateral ligament in his pitching elbow. Acuña's injury came just as the Braves were looking forward to having two starters return to their lineup. Third baseman Austin Riley and catcher Sean Murphy started in Monday's game against Washington. Riley missed two weeks with tightness in his left side and Murphy had been out with a strained left oblique since March 30. “There are few players in this league that are on a level he is,” Riley said. “It's a joy to watch him every night and to have that happen, you feel for him.” Riley said he and other key players “are going to have to step up and pull our full weight. He'll be missed for sure.” The Braves have won six straight NL East titles and won the 2021 World Series as Acuña was rehabbing from his first season-ending injury. The Braves entered Monday's games in second place in the division, six games behind Philadelphia. “We have more than 100 games left and we're 10 games over .500,” Murphy said. “We're still in a great spot. I don't think there's any reason to be worried about the Atlanta Braves.” Even so, Murphy added “I don't think there's anyone else in the big leagues who could just step in and do what Ronald does.” Manager Brian Snitker chose second baseman Ozzie Albies as the team's new leadoff hitter. Jared Kelenic and Adam Duvall, who have been sharing time in left field, each started against the Nationals. Duvall replaced Acuña in right field and Kelenic started in left field. “You hate it,” said Snitker of Acuña's injury. “It's part of it. You try to look at it that now we're going to give somebody a chance to do something special in his absence. ... Jared is going to get some regular at-bats. I think he's ready to take that next step.” Snitker said “I feel worse for the kid than for us that he has to go through this again.” Acuña was voted the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases, becoming the first player to have at least 40 homers and 70 steals in a season. The 26-year-old from Venezuela was hitting .250 with four homers, 15 RBIs and 16 steals this season. The Braves recalled outfielder J.P. Martinez from Triple-A Gwinnett and infielder Joey Wendle was designated for assignment. Martinez will be the fourth outfielder. AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",

        "description": "More than half of the state’s perfect scorers have come from the Latur division",
        "content": "The dominance of the Latur pattern was evident again in this year's , as it registered the highest number of students in the state scoring 100 per cent marks. This year, the Latur division produced 123 students who scored cent percent marks in the SSC board examination, which is more than half of the total 187 students across the state who achieved a perfect score. This success did not happen suddenly or by chance. For over two decades, teachers and educational institutes in the Marathwada region have worked hard and evolved a system—popularly called the ‘Latur Pattern’—which has helped hundreds and thousands of students crack competitive exams like NEET and IIT-JEE and get good grades in class X and XII board exams. ADVERTISEMENT Despite the Latur division securing a seventh position among the nine divisional boards in Maharashtra with respect to overall pass percentage, its overall pass percentage this year is 95.27 per cent. However, known as a \"topper factory\" in academic circles, the Latur division lived up to its nickname even this year. Building on the much-talked-about ‘Latur pattern,’ schools across the district have managed to secure a strong presence in the elite ‘100 per cent club,’ year after year, a phenomenon that has been especially evident in the state board results post-2016 after the state education department introduced bonus marks for art and culture for the Class X exams. The state board awards extra marks to students for their remarkable achievements in the fields of art and sports in the SSC board exams. For the past few years, the state board has been declaring results based on the best of five subjects. This year, a total of 187 students achieved a perfect 100 per cent score. Division-wise, Latur had the highest number with 123 students, followed by with 32, and Pune with 10. Mumbai had eight students, Amravati had seven, while Kolhapur and Konkan each had three. Nagpur had one student, and Nashik had none. Last year, of the 151 students with 100 percent, 109 were from Latur, while six were from Mumbai. In 2022, 70 students from Latur scored 100 percent among the 122 from across the state. Of these, Pune had five and Mumbai had one student who scored 100 per cent that year. In 2020, of the 242 students who scored a perfect 100 across the nine divisions in the state, 151 were from the Latur division. In 2018, 125 students scored 100 percent marks, of which 68 were from Latur alone. The Latur pattern of study is a model that gained prominence during the 1980s as an initiative by a group of dedicated academics in the district, who aimed to enhance the quality of education in the region. After the district was established in 1982, schools and colleges began actively training students with parental support to improve learning outcomes. “It is an old model started by a group of educationists and passed on to the new generation, followed to date. The term ‘Latur pattern,’ however, was coined when the then education minister Vilasrao Deshmukh used it while felicitating meritorious students at an event during that time,\" said a teacher from a Zilla Parishad school in Latur. An official from the state board said, \"The Latur pattern has been successful for years. While it has produced many high-scoring students, we are now focusing on improving outcomes for all students. Over the years, the overall pass percentage in the division has been declining, and we are actively working to reverse this trend.\"",

        "content": "Best News Website or Mobile Service WAN-IFRA Digital Media Awards Worldwide 2022 Best News Website or Mobile Service Digital Media Awards Worldwide 2022 PARIS : Rafael Nadal exited what could be his last French Open to an outpouring of love and support with a first-round defeat by Alexander Zverev, wishing to be back at Roland Garros for the Paris 2024 Olympics. \"I hope to see you again, but I don't know,\" Nadal told an ecstatic crowd after his straight-sets loss on Monday. \"There's a big percentage I will not be back here but I am not 100 per cent sure. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that motivates me.\" It will the third time since his debut at Roland Garros in 2005, that Nadal, whose body has been martyred by 23 years of professional tennis and who left the tournament with a crushed foot after his record-improving 14th title two years ago, does not get to celebrate his June 3 birthday in Paris. The French, who tend to arrive on court Philippe Chatrier fashionably late on the back of a long lunch, skipped coffee and digestif to fill the arena before the king, racket in hand as usual, stepped onto the court to deafening roars. Spain's Nadal stuck to his routine, avoiding the lines and crossing them with his right foot, sprinting to the baseline during warm-up and positioning his two bottles diagonally aimed at the court. On a rainy day in Paris, organisers closed the roof, adding to the intimacy of the moment. On a court he knows like no one else, Nadal struggled to find his mark early on, netting a routine drop shot and serving a double fault to give Zverev the opening game. The German, who after winning the Rome Masters was the worst possible draw for Nadal, kept his foot on the gas pedal to take the first set even if the Mallorcan showed glimpses of his best with a couple of spinning forehand winners down the line. As soon as Zverev eased the pressure, however, Nadal converted his first break point to take a 3-2 lead in the second set. \"Rafa! Rafa!\" went the crowd, again, as world number ones Iga Swiatek and Novak Djokovic, as well as fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, joined the party. Nadal served for the set but Zverev levelled and forced a tiebreak, which he comfortably won. There was another break for Nadal in the third set, and some 'I-can-still-do-it' fist pumps after a few jaw-dropping winners, but two years after Zverev left their semi-final match on a wheelchair with a broken foot, the German was too good this time. There was a sense of anticipation on the morning of the Nadal v Zverev clash as Swiatek, gunning for a fourth title here, kicked off her campaign with a 6-1 6-2 demolition of French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean. Swiatek has now won her last 15 matches in Paris following her back-to-back wins in 2022 and 2023. Coco Gauff also made a strong start, dispatching German Julia Avdeeva 6-1 6-1 for her 50th Grand Slam match victory. The 20-year-old American, who won the U.S. Open last year to break her Grand Slam duck, is looking to claim her first French Open title after losing the 2022 final in Paris. In the men's draw, Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, seeded second, barely broke sweat as he downed American Chris Eubanks in straight sets, just like former runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas did with Hungarian journeyman Marton Fucsovics.",

        "content": "The Israeli Prime Minister has said the strike on Rafah was a mistake (Image: Getty ) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has admitted that a “tragic mistake” was made after an Israeli strike in Gaza hit a camp housing displaced Palestinians, reportedly killing at least 45 people. On Sunday night a strike by the IDF said to be targeting a Hamas terror installation In Rafah has since been turned into one of the biggest single losses of civilian life in Gaza during the Israel -Hamas war. Israel 's military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after the attack which it said had killed two senior militants. Sunday night's strike helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) Speaking to the Israeli Parliament, known as the Knesset, Prime Minister Netanyahu said: “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake.

Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people, about half of Gaza's population, displaced from other parts of the territory. On Sunday Hamas launched a barrage of rockets from Gaza towards heavily populated central Israel , setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The US National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images\" from the strike on Rafah \"are heartbreaking.\" It said the US was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. \"There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he wrote.

        "content": "ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. It recently released a 8,000 word exposé on how 3M knew that its PFAS chemicals were in people’s bodies. The information in the article is too important to overlook, so here are its highlights. In 1997, Jim Johnson gave a 3M Corporation chemist, Kris Hansen, an unusual assignment: Hansen was to test human blood for chemical contamination. With a doctoral dissertation on tiny particles in the atmosphere, she was the right choice. What was the reason for Hansen’s assignment? Several of 3M’s most successful products contained human-made compounds called fluorochemicals. The company’s PFOS (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) had tested positive in the bodies of 3M factory workers. General population samples, too, seemed to contain the blood contaminants. Were these results a lab error? She used a mass spectrometer, which weighs molecules and makes identification possible. She and her team devoted several weeks analyzing more blood — every single one was contaminated. She updated Johnson on her team’s findings. His response was “cryptic.” Without any feedback from her supervisors, she and her team ordered fresh blood samples from every supplier with whom 3M worked. Each of the samples tested positive for PFOS. Then her boss took early retirement. Although Hansen had been told that PFOS wasn’t harmful in factory workers, she wanted to be certain. She knew from her studies and previous field research that the most reliable way to gauge the safety of chemicals is to study them over time, in animals and, if possible, in humans. What Hansen didn’t know was that 3M had already conducted animal studies, starting in the 1970s. The studies had shown PFOS to be toxic, yet the results remained secret, even to many at the company. Rats and monkeys died within weeks of PFOS exposure. In 1979, an internal company report deemed PFOS “certainly more toxic than anticipated” and recommended longer term studies. Hansen’s bosses never told her that PFOS was toxic. Meanwhile, one superior intimated that her lab testing equipment might be contaminated. After careful cleaning, the results stayed the same. 3M bought three additional and very expensive mass spectrometers, and she repeated her tests on different populations and in different venues. Each sample contained PFOS. The chemical seemed to be everywhere. On its website today, 3M describes fluorochemicals. “3M helped pioneer the science of fluorochemistry more than 60 years ago – and we’re continuing to find new ways to put these amazing materials to work ... 3M fluorochemicals are engineered for high purity, performance and sustainability – including our next-generation C4 chemistry, offering a favorable safety and environmental profile for its intended uses.” These compounds are now considered “forever chemicals.” In 2023 the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) released the first tranche of testing data for PFAS in drinking water. They found hundreds of water systems are contaminated with the toxic “forever chemicals.” About 8% of water systems that serve approximately 14 million people detected two of the most common of these chemicals, PFOA and PFOS, in their drinking water at levels that exceed EPA’s proposed drinking water limits. A colleague gave Hansen more blood samples to test, which were positive for PFOS — yet the samples came from a horse. Instead of succumbing to humiliation, Hansen questioned why PFOS was making its way into animals. Her answer was unnerving: the chemical had spread through the food chain and perhaps through water. Hansen and her team ultimately found PFOS in eagles, chickens, rabbits, cows, pigs, and other animals. They also found 14 additional fluorochemicals in human blood, including several produced by 3M. Some were present in wastewater from a 3M factory. Hansen found no recourse for the way senior colleagues kept questioning her work. Instead, she devised an experiment in which blood without PFOS might be located. She was successful — samples that showed no trace of PFOS were located in blood that had been collected before 3M created PFOS. “Apparently, fluorochemicals had entered human blood after the company started selling products that contained them,” the ProPublica article explains. “They had leached out of 3M’s sprays, coatings, and factories — and into all of us.” Hansen met a scientist who revealed to her a paper written in 1981 by 3M scientists. It outlined experiments and confirmed suspicions about 3M origins of PFOS, but 3M lawyers had urged the lab not to reveal their findings. A presentation Hansen was asked to give to 3M’s CEO, Livio D. DeSimone, “seemed to view her diligence as a betrayal: Her data could be damaging to the company.” The CEO fell asleep in the meeting. While defending herself, she recalled other scientists before her who had been unsuccessful in persuading the upper 3M echelon. Soon afterward, Hansen’s job description changed. Only experiments specifically requested by a supervisor would be permitted. Her new role would be to analyze samples for studies that other employees were conducting — and to do so without question. Yet Hansen’s research was not lost. The results of her research “were quietly making their way into the files of the Environmental Protection Agency.” By 1998, 3M officials admitted that the company had measured PFOS in blood samples from around the US — Hansen’s research — but did not believe that its products presented a substantial risk to human health. Hansen, meanwhile, was ostracized by her superiors and co-workers. Over 2 decades Hansen worked on many new tasks at 3M — except fluorochemicals. Pressure from the EPA forced 3M to discontinue its entire portfolio of PFOS-­related chemicals. In 2006, after the EPA accused 3M of violating the Toxic Substances Control Act, in part by repeatedly ­failing to disclose the harms of fluorochemicals promptly, the company agreed to pay a small penalty of $1.5 million, without admitting wrongdoing. A swath of 150 square miles around 3M’s headquarters was found to be polluted with PFAS — local fish and water supplies were full of it. In October 2022, after Hansen had been at 3M for 26 years, her job was eliminated, and she chose not to apply for a new one. She reached out to ProPublica for what would be her first public discussion of her fluorochemicals research. She expressed regret that revealing what she had known earlier in her life “would have been too much to bear at the time.” Johnson, Hansen’s former boss, not only concurred with her accounts but added multi-layered details of his own attempts to uncover flurochemicals in 3M products and their reaction in humans. 3M has now settled a lawsuit filed by cities and towns with polluted water to the tune of $12.5 billion to filter out PFAS — depending on how many water systems need the chemicals removed. “The settlement, however, doesn’t approach the scale of the problem,” the ProPublica article concludes. “At least 45% of US tap water is estimated to contain one or more forever chemicals.” The cost of removing them all will likely reach $100 billion. An April 2024 Biden-Harris rule will designate the PFAS chemicals as hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as Superfund, and “will help ensure that polluters pay to clean up their contamination.” The original story in its entirety is exempt from ProPublica’s Creative Commons license until July 19.

Glide bombs are heavy Soviet-era bombs fitted with precision guidance systems and launched from aircraft flying out of range of air defences. The bombs weigh more than a ton and blast targets to smithereens, leaving a huge crater. Two Patriot systems are needed to protect the northeastern Kharkiv region, where the Kremlin's forces launched a cross-border offensive on May 10 that left Ukrainian troops reeling, Zelenskyy said. The death toll from a glide bomb attack on a Kharkiv shopping mall Saturday rose to 18, regional Gov Oleh Syniehubov said Monday, with five people still missing. The Kharkiv push has further strained Ukraine's already depleted army, which in recent months has been fighting Russia's intence drive deeper into the partially occupied eastern Donetsk region. Zelenskyy said on Sunday that the Kremlin's army is mustering at another point in Russia, farther north but close to the approximately 1,000-kilometre front line, aiming to stretch Ukraine's depleted army thinner and crack its resistance in the area. Zelenskyy and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez signed a bilateral security agreement that allocates 1 billion euros of military aid to Ukraine in 2024, and 5 billion euros by 2027. More Leopard tanks and artillery ammunition also feature in the package. \"After more than two years (of war), Russia's aggression continues, and that's why it is more necessary than ever to redouble our support,\" Sanchez told the joint news conference. The Patriot is a surface-to-air guided missile system that was first deployed in the 1980s and can target aircraft, cruise missiles and shorter-range ballistic missiles. It is expensive but is effective and sought after by armies around the world. European countries have hesitated to send Patriot systems to Ukraine, fearing they may need them. Spain's King Felipe VI earlier welcomed Zelenskyy at the capital's Barajas airport. Zelenskyy was due in neighbouring Portugal on Tuesday. He had been due to visit Spain earlier this month but postponed all his foreign trips after Russia launched its offensive in the Kharkiv region. Ukraine has repeatedly tried to strike behind Russian lines, often with drones, though Russia's response to the new technology used in unmanned vehicles has improved in recent months. A Ukrainian long-range drone set a new distance record by attacking overnight an early-warning radar in the Russian city of Orsk, some 1,800 kilometres from the Ukrainian border, Ukrainian officials claimed. The operation was conducted by Ukraine's military intelligence, GUR, an intelligence official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorised to comment publicly. Ukraine's previous long-range attack record was at 1,500 kilometres when a drone struck an oil refinery in Russia's Bashkortostan on May 9. It was not immediately possible to verify either claim. Meanwhile, a Western intelligence assessment suggested that Russia's Kharkiv offensive has subsided. \"The northern Kharkiv front has likely stabilised with Russian territorial control fragmented and not joined up,\" the UK Defence Ministry said Sunday. \"Russia's gains in this axis will be limited in the coming week, as Russia's initial momentum has been contained by Ukrainian resistance.\" That is in line with Zelenskyy's claim last Friday that Ukrainian forces have secured \"combat control\" of areas where Russian troops entered the Kharkiv region. The onslaught unfolding as the weather improves has brought Ukraine's biggest military test since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. Slow deliveries of support by its Western partners, especially a lengthy delay in US military aid, have left Ukraine at the mercy of Russia's bigger army and air force.

        "content": "Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory used additive manufacturing to produce the first defect-free complex tungsten parts for use in extreme environments. The accomplishment could have positive implications for clean-energy technologies such as fusion energy. Tungsten has the highest melting point of any metal, making it ideal for fusion reactors where plasma temperatures exceed 180 million degrees Fahrenheit. In comparison, the sun’s center is about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit. In its pure form, tungsten is brittle at room temperature and easily shatters. To counter this, ORNL researchers developed an electron-beam 3D-printer to deposit tungsten, layer by layer, into precise three-dimensional shapes. This technology uses a magnetically directed stream of particles in a high-vacuum enclosure to melt and bind metal powder into a solid-metal object. The vacuum environment reduces foreign material contamination and residual stress formation. “Electron-beam additive manufacturing is promising for the processing of complex tungsten geometries,” said ORNL ’s Michael Kirka . “This is an important step for expanding the use of temperature-resistant metals in energy resources that will support a sustainable, carbon-free future.” Image and article courtesy of ORNL , U.S. Department of Energy.

        "description": "The Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation is a step closer to acquiring a 1,500-acre state park in DeKalb County, much of which was once part of a reservation that was illegally seized from the tribe in the mid-19 th century.",
        "content": "SPRINGFIELD – The Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation is a step closer to acquiring a 1,500-acre state park in , much of which was once part of a reservation that was illegally seized from the tribe in the mid-19 th century. As the Senate worked through its last stack of bills Sunday before planning to adjourn for the summer, it voted 49-7 to pass Bill 867, which authorizes deeding the property to the tribe for $1. “Rarely do we get to make amends for the sins of our collective past,” state Sen. Mark Walker, D-Arlington Heights, the bill’s chief sponsor, said on the Senate floor. “As you might expect, this bill is to repair the 150 years we have suffered with a moral wound.” The Prairie Band Potawatomi were originally granted a reservation of about two square miles – about 1,280 acres – in the 1829 Treaty of Prairie du Chien. But around 1849, Chief Shab-eh-nay traveled west to northeast Kansas, where many other members of the tribe had relocated. While he was gone, the federal government declared the reservation land abandoned and sold it at public auction. In the 1970s, the state of Illinois used federal grant funds to buy about 1,500 acres that now make up Lake and State Park. That land partially overlaps the original reservation. Other parts of the original reservation consist of county-owned property and about 30 private homes. The bill represents one part of the Prairie Band Potawatomi’s long-running effort to reestablish its presence in Illinois. The tribe also recently acquired 130 acres in the area, and last month the U.S. Department of the Interior formally placed that land in trust, making it the only federally recognized tribal reservation in Illinois. Acquisition of the 1,500 acres of park land would greatly expand the Potawatomi’s footprint in the area. But that has made some residents who live nearby nervous about the future of the community, especially if the tribe decides to develop a casino or make other major changes to the park area. The issue has also made some state lawmakers nervous, especially those unaccustomed to working with issues involving tribal relations. “This just came up and we’re receiving a lot of opposition, and this is unique to our state,” Republican state Sen. Sue Rezin, of Morris, who represents a neighboring district, said during a committee hearing Saturday. Tribal officials have said they have no plans to develop a casino in the area, noting that a casino already exists in downtown Aurora, only about 45 minutes to the east. State Sen. Win Stoller, R-East Peoria, whose district includes the park land, said he believes residents of the area have nothing to fear from the land transfer. “The Prairie Band have committed to keeping the park open to the public and even have plans to improve the infrastructure and experiences available in the park,” he said on the Senate floor. “Local officials including the mayor of Shabbona are in support. I believe this is the right thing to do.” The bill next moves to the House, which is scheduled to reconvene Tuesday to wrap up its business for the spring session.",

        "content": "A Saskatchewan man is still on a high after joining the ranks of mountain climbers from the province who have reached the peak of Mount Everest. Landry Warnez summited Mount Everest earlier this month. It took him four days to reach the top of the mountain, the tallest in the world above sea level, in Nepal from Everest base camp. He didn't sleep for the final 24 hours of the ascent. \"At the top because it's low oxygen — you're using supplementary oxygen — it feels almost like a dream,\" said Warnez, who is originally from Balcarres and currently living in Saskatoon. \"You're not thinking completely clearly, but it's pretty amazing.\" Warnez credits trekking through Nepal and spending time at Everest base camp last year for fuelling his desire to climb to the peak. \"I've always been drawn to looking for an adventure, right, and that's something that I wanted [to do] at this point in my life,\" Warnez said. Landry Warnez, left, celebrates on the summit of Mount Everest after a four day ascent. (Submitted by Landry Warnez) Warnez says it took a lot of training to prepare for the expedition. He spent months in the gym building up his strength and cardio in addition to doing climbing-specific training in Canmore, Alta. \"A big thing to climbing Everest is cardio,\" Warnez said. \"You're climbing between eight to 12 hours a day, multiple days on end.\" Warnez says the challenges associated with summiting Mount Everest include getting sick, exhausting the oxygen supply at the wrong time, and attempting the trek in the wrong weather window. \"With Everest the risk is really highlighted internationally when people die, but I obviously felt that it was a risk I was willing to take,\" Warnez said Warnez says the risk didn't end once he made it to the summit of Mount Everest: It took two days to get back down to base camp. \"You're ecstatic [at the top] but also realize you have quite the challenge to just get off the mountain ,\"Warnez said. One of the camps where Warnez stayed during his climb. (Submitted by Warnez) Warnez, who described the climb as exhausting but rewarding, made sure to represent his home province when he got to the peak by posing with the Saskatchewan flag for a few pictures. \"I have a lot of pride coming from Saskatchewan, and I thought it [bringing the flag] would be something unique,\" Warnez said. \"I think there have been around 100 or over 100 Canadians [who] have climbed Everest, but only only a handful from Saskatchewan.\"",

        "content": "Geneva: The World Health Organization chief on Monday urged countries to nail down a landmark global agreement on handling of future pandemics after they missed a hard deadline. Scarred by Covid-19 -- which killed millions, shredded economies and crippled health systems -- nations have spent two years trying to forge binding commitments on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response. Negotiators failed to clinch a deal ahead of this week's World Health Assembly -- the annual gathering of WHO's 194 member states -- the deadline for concluding the talks. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus opened the assembly Monday, saying he was confident that an agreement would be secured. \"Of course, we all wish that we had been able to reach a consensus on the agreement in time for this health assembly and crossed the finish line,\" he said. \"But I remain confident that you still will, because where there is a will, there is a way.\" Tedros said the task before negotiators had been \"immense, technically, legally, and politically\", and that they had been \"operating on a very ambitious time line\". \"You have demonstrated a clear commitment to reaching an agreement,\" he said, adding that negotiators had \"worked long days and nights\", closing meetings as late as 4:00 am. He hailed their dedication to push forward despite \"a torrent of misinformation that was undermining your negotiations\". While missing Friday's deadline, countries have voiced a commitment to keep pushing for an accord. Negotiators are due on Tuesday to present the outcome of the talks to the assembly, which runs until June 1, and the assembly will take stock and decide what to do next. \"I know that there remains among you a common will to get this done, so, there must always be a way,\" Tedros said. \"Meaning the solution is in your hands,\" he stressed. Parallel talks have also taken place on revising the International Health Regulations, which were first adopted in 1969 and constitute the existing international legally binding framework for responding to public health emergencies around the world. The proposed amendments to the IHR, including adding more nuance to a system meant to alert countries to potential health emergencies of global concern, might have a better chance of being adopted during this week's assembly, observers said.",

        "content": "An Egyptian soldier was killed during a clash with Israeli troops at a Gaza border crossing on Monday while an Israeli airstrike on Sunday killed at least 40 Palestinians at a camp for displaced people, further inflaming regional tensions over the Israel-Hamas war. Egypt’s military confirmed that a border guard died at the Rafah border crossing on Monday, in bloodshed that threatened to escalate tensions with Israel. Separately, the airstrike at the camp northwest of the Gazan city of Rafah drew international condemnation. Israel acknowledged the death of dozens of people in the strike, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called “a tragic mistake\" in an address to the Knesset. Israeli leaders said they were still investigating both incidents. In the border clash, the Israel Defense Forces said “a shooting incident occurred on the Egyptian border,\" and that discussions with Egypt were ongoing, without giving any more detail. Israel said the airstrike late Sunday at a Rafah tent community was based on “precise intelligence\" and that it killed two “senior\" officials from Hamas, designated a terrorist organization by the US and European Union. But governments across the world were quick to condemn Israel for the strike. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was “outraged,\" while EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said he was “horrified.\" The White House said in a statement that images of innocent civilians killed in the strike were “heartbreaking.\" “Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,\" the National Security Council said in a statement. “But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians.\" Israeli troops started operations around the outskirts of Rafah, which lies in southern Gaza, early this month. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will attack the city because it’s the last bastion of Hamas, an Iran-backed Islamist group, and several thousand of its fighters are lodged there. The US and other countries fear mass casualties among the Palestinian civilians in Rafah and have urged Israel to cancel or sharply curtail an assault to prevent harm to innocents. The White House said Monday it was “actively engaging\" with the IDF and partners in the region to better assess what had occured. The US and others have also voiced concerns about an Israeli attack on Rafah worsening ties with Egypt. The two Middle Eastern countries signed a peace deal in 1979, which is seen as crucial to Israel’s security. Egypt has been highly vocal of the war in Gaza and consistently called on Israel to agree to a cease-fire. The Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7 when thousands of Hamas fighters crossed into southern Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and abducting 250. Israel’s counterattack has killed some 35,000 Gazans, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. With assistance from Justin Sink.

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71.

That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ‘Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. — By TIM REYNOLDS, AP Basketball Writer",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71.

That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ‘Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. — By TIM REYNOLDS, AP Basketball Writer",

Bagga alleged that Balkar Singh, an AAP MLA, engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct during a video call with a woman seeking employment. New Delhi: The National Commission for Women (NCW) has called for a swift investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct against Punjab minister Balkar Singh. The NCW has requested a report from the state police within three days. NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma issued a notice to Punjab DGP Gaurav Yadav following accusations by BJP leader Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga. Bagga alleged that Balkar Singh, an AAP MLA, engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct during a video call with a woman seeking employment. Sharma condemned the incident as an affront to the dignity of the woman involved and urged immediate personal intervention by the Punjab DGP. She said that if the allegations are substantiated, the provisions of the IPC should be applied in the First Information Report (FIR). “The accused person should be arrested at the earliest and the detailed action taken report along with a copy of the F.I.R should be communicated to the Commission within 3 days,” she said. NCW calls for strict action In a post on X, the NCW stated that Rekha Sharma called for urgent intervention from the Punjab Director General of Police (DGP) to ensure a prompt and impartial investigation into the matter. “The National Commission for Women is gravely disturbed by a Twitter post alleging inappropriate conduct by Punjab MLA Mr Balkar Singh. The reported acts, if substantiated, constitute serious violations under IPC sections 354 and 354B, directly affronting a woman’s dignity. @sharmarekha vehemently condemn such behavior and call for urgent intervention from @DGPPunjabPolice to ensure a prompt and impartial investigation. A comprehensive report to be submitted in 3 days,” the NCW said in a post on X. Balkar refuses to comment, Opposition questions CM Mann Balkar Singh refused to comment on the allegations, saying that he has no knowledge of the obscene video. “I have no comments and it is not in my knowledge,” Singh told reporters. Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Bikram Singh Majithia questioned Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann about the lack of action against Singh despite ‘all the evidence.’ Punjab is the land of gurus pirs, can there be representatives of the public who are doing unethical work in this land?” he posted on X. BJP leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa also attacked the Aam Aadmi Party over the allegations. “Would CM @BhagwantMann Ji protect Balkar Singh as well just like he shielded Lal Chand Kataruchak, despite their sex tapes being made public??? How many more characterless MLAs AAP has in its kitty???” he asked.",

        "content": "Dear Amy: My wife and I have an older dog that we got when we were first engaged. “Cassie” has grown along with us and now that she is in her elder years, we are protective and concerned about her. Well, about six months ago we fell in love with a small-breed young dog and brought her home. It did not occur to us that this might create a problem. Cassie now seems stressed and unhappy all the time. She tries to hide from the younger dog, who has playfully nipped at her. We spoke with our vet, who suggested “rehoming” the younger dog. She told us that some animal dynamics just don’t work out. We don’t want our elder dog to spend her final years stressed and unhappy. We have learned that friends of ours would like to take the young dog, but we feel so guilty about doing this. We are reaching out for some of your compassionate common sense. – Guilty Dear Guilty: Assuming responsibility for the life, health, and happiness of an animal is an almost sacred stewardship. We owe it to our animals to make the hard choices in what we believe will be in their best interests. And yes, oftentimes guilt follows the hardest choices. You are choosing to protect the more vulnerable animal, and that’s the right thing to do. Dear Amy: “M” reported a “mysterious mourner” at their father’s funeral, which took place many years ago. This mysterious mourner didn’t introduce himself to anyone, leading to speculation that he was perhaps a “love child” of the deceased dad, who had been an alcoholic. It is quite possible that the mourner was a friend from AA. – Friend of Bill Dear Friend: Several readers suggested this. Thank you! “M” was fixated on the thought of having a half-sibling out there, and, according to the narrative, this was a distinct possibility.",

By John C. Azu The Bayelsa State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal has affirmed the election of Governor Duoye Diri. In a unanimous judgement on Monday, the three-member panel led by Justice Adekunle Adeleye dismissed the petition filed by the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Timipre Sylva, for lacking in merit. The panel further held that the reliefs of the petitioners were contradictory since they did not tender any electoral material to show that any irregularity occurred during the election. The tribunal also observed that the petitioners were unable to discharge the burden of proof that was placed on them by the law. Reinstatement of Emir Sanusi done in Kano’s best interest –Gov’t BREAKING: Court orders police to evict Bayero from mini palace The panel added that the APC and Sylva failed to show, “polling units by polling units evidence of the non-compliance submitted and how it substantially affected the outcome of the election” The tribunal struck out as incompetent, all the additional proof of evidence as well as statements on oath of some of the witnesses that testified for the petitioners. Sylva had challenged the result of the November 11, 2023 governorship election which saw the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declaring the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) with 175,195 with APC’s 110,108. Sylva further contended that INEC also excluded results from three local governments of Southern Ijaw, Ogbia and Nembe. Governor Diri commended the judiciary for upholding his victory and the wishes of the people. He vowed not to be distracted in his commitment to serve the people of the state. Meanwhile, Sylva has vowed to challenge the outcome of the election at the Court of Appeal after meeting critical stakeholders of the party. “No quantum of miscarriage of justice will make us lose confidence in the Nigerian judicial system,” he said.

        "content": "The reigning world champion crashed out of the lead on the final lap of the Catalan GP sprint to end a Saturday win drought dating back to the Austrian GP last year. It softened the blow of a difficult sprint for championship leader Jorge Martin, who was able to extend his points lead over Bagnaia. The factory Ducati rider bounced back brilliantly in the grand prix, however, to beat Martin for his third GP win of the season. Martin extends his championship lead to 39 points, while Marc Marquez rose from 14th on the grid to seal podiums in both races at Barcelona. Prior to the weekend, Aleix Espargaro announced he will retire from MotoGP at the end of the 2024 season. But he proved he is going out on a high with pole and victory in the sprint. In the latest Tank Slappers podcast, Autosport's Lewis Duncan and Motorsport.com's Oriol Puigdemont discuss Espargaro's career and the on-track action at Barcelona. They also look at the looming decision Ducati must make about its factory line-up for 2025 and why it's not as easy as it may seem.",

        "content": "Revenue worth $100 million to be generated through the export: PTC ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tobacco Company Limited (PTC) has announced the launch of its ‘Made in Pakistan 3.0’ initiative, marking a significant milestone in the company’s history of economic contribution. This initiative aims to export PTC’s modern oral tobacco-free nicotine pouches, Velo, to Japan, potentially generating $100 million annually through all its exports, as estimated by PTC. The launch event was attended by Federal Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan, along with guests from both the public and private sectors and members of the media. Recognized as Pakistan’s first multinational company, PTC has been a cornerstone of the nation’s economy. Over the past five years, the company has contributed over Rs 680 billion to the national exchequer, earning the prestigious ‘Highest Taxpayers Award’ in 2024 in recognition of its substantial fiscal contributions. In April 2019, PTC embarked on its ‘Made in Pakistan’ initiative, aligned with the Government of Pakistan’s export ambitions, focusing on exporting cigarettes and processed tobacco to various countries. This venture has generated over $157 million since its inception, significantly bolstering the Pakistani economy. Building on this success, the ‘Made in Pakistan 3.0’ initiative aims to further enhance Pakistan’s economic standing. The introduction of nicotine pouches to the Japanese market represents a pivotal step in PTC’s commitment to innovation and growth, potentially adding an additional $50 million annually through foreign exchange earnings. Federal Minister Jam Kamal stated, “Today marks a new chapter in PTC’s history. The ‘Made in Pakistan 3.0’ initiative not only exemplifies PTC’s dedication to economic progress but also showcases Pakistan’s capability to produce high-quality, innovative products for the global market.” Minister Kamal added, “Pakistan has always been an ideal destination for foreign investors. The government is doing its best to facilitate large-scale investors at all levels. Today’s event is a testimony to the government’s extended support under the premiership of PM Mian Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif.” British American Tobacco Group’s Regional Director for Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa, Michael Dijanosic, remarked, “It is a proud moment as PTC prepares to export modern oral nicotine pouches to key markets like Japan. This achievement highlights our strong partnership and marks a major step forward for both BAT and Pakistan. Expanding into international markets creates new revenue streams and opportunities, reinforcing our position as global leaders.” PTC’s Managing Director and CEO, Ali Akbar, added, “We are thrilled to expand our reach with Velo and contribute further to the economic development of Pakistan. Our commitment to excellence and innovation drives us to continuously seek new opportunities and markets. I would like to further request the Government of Pakistan to continue extending their valuable support by framing the right regulatory and fiscal regime for this segment, enabling it to flourish. Sensible regulations will certainly determine the long-term success and sustainability of this business.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

        "content": "A JEALOUS man from Mberengwa District in the Midlands Province who fatally stabbed a rival suitor with a knife two years ago following a feud over a woman who had ditched him has been sentenced to an effective 18 years in jail. Hardlife Mudzingwa of Duna Village under Chief Mataruse killed Blessing Mxotshwa of Number 2 Village 19, Tokwe Valley in Shurugwi a week after his ex-girlfriend, Alice Makonese ditched him. Bulawayo High Court judge Justice Bongani Ndlovu who is on circuit in Gweru convicted Mudzingwa, Mberengwa, of murder with constructive intent. Mudzingwa had tendered a plea of not guilty. In passing the sentence, Justice Ndlovu condemned Mudzingwa’s conduct saying he deserved a lengthy prison term. “The conduct of the accused was deplorable and lacking maturity. It appears the use of lethal weapons is now being normalised in the Midlands province hence the need to nip it in the bud “An innocent life was unnecessarily lost and courts have time and again bemoaned loss of life through violence. For all these reasons, I find the following sentence appropriate, the accused is sentenced to 18 years imprisonment,” he ruled. Justice Ndlovu said Mudzingwa should have simply respected Makonese’s choice and moved on with his life. Prosecuting, Ms Chipo Hungwe said on April 8, 2022, at stand number 15, Village 14 in Tokwe 3, Valley in Shurugwi, Mudzingwa had an altercation with the deceased resulting in stabling him with a homemade knife on the collarbone and left shoulder. According to a post-mortem report, which was submitted by the State, the cause of death was due to assault, haemorrhagic shock, penetrating abdominal wound, and perforated lower abdominal aorta. In her testimony, Makonese said she had ended her relationship with Mudzingwa and was now in a new relationship with Mxotshwa, which irked Mudzingwa. She told the court that on the fateful day at about 3pm, she met the now deceased at Baba Nigel’s homestead and the two proceeded together to her house where they slept. Makonese heard someone trying to open the door but failed since the door was locked. She said the intruder then entered the house through the window. Makonese told the court that she realised that it was Mudzingwa whom she ordered to leave since they were no longer in a relationship. The court heard that Mudzingwa forced his way into the bedroom and had a scuffle with Mxotshwa and he overpowered him. “He took out a homemade knife from his pocket and tried to stab Mxotshwa, but Makonese grabbed the knife by the blade, and her palms were cut. She jumped out of the house through the window,” said Ms Hungwe. Makonese informed her neighbour Laiza Kombora before she returned home to collect her child and found Mxotshwa’s body lying in a pool of blood. She took her child and proceeded to Ishmael Mudzana’s homestead where she informed him of the incident. The two made a report to the police leading to the arrest of Mudzingwa. Mudzingwa was represented by Mr Tafadzwa Komboni of Jumo Mashoko and Partners.",

        "content": "How Mike Tyson's mystery illness could be deadly... and what it means for his upcoming fight against Jake Paul READ MORE: Mike Tyson, 57, suffers medical scare during flight to Los Angeles By Maiya Focht For Dailymail.Com Published: 14:09 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 14:26 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Fans of heavyweight champion fighter Mike Tyson , 57, are concerned about his health following an alarming scare on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles on Sunday . Tyson, who is set to fight 27 year old Jake Paul in a mere two months, became inexplicably dizzy and nauseous — symptoms that are said to be linked to an ulcer, thought to be in his abdomen. Paramedics boarded the plane in California to deliver immediate medical attention to Mr Tyson. The debacle has led to speculation as to what exactly has happened to cause these odd symptoms, and whether or not it means he will have to delay the long-awaited fight. Concerningly, some research suggests that Tyson could be at risk of developing a more sinister condition, including a catastrophic internal bleed. Mike Tyson suffered a medical scare during a flight from Miami to Los Angeles on Sunday. Stomach ulcers are small sores that develop on the lining of the stomach or small intestine and can cause a host of GI symptoms, from nausea and bloating to vomiting and dizziness. One of the most severe and rare complications of an ulcer is the potential for the sore to turn into a rupture - splitting your stomach or colon open in what's called a perforation, according to the NIH . This is a rare complication, affecting approximately 2 to 14 percent of people with ulcers. When the stomach or colon splits open, the acid and bacteria that they normally contains may spill out into the body, which can lead to a life-threatening condition known as sepsis. Initial symptoms can present a bit like a fever, causing dizziness, nausea and a high temperature. An ulcer stomach perforation and is fatal in about 30 percent of cases. The risk may be a concern to Tyson's doctors, as being hit in the stomach can also cause perforation, particularly in ulcerated regions. Having an ulcer or getting punched in the stomach, 'doesn’t mean you will have a gastrointestinal perforation, but your risk of having one is higher,' according to doctors from the Cleveland Clinic wrote . GOT A HEALTH-RELATED STORY? EMAIL: Health@dailymail.com Advertisement However, more likely is simply that the altitude made the typical symptoms of an abdominal ulcer much worse. The everyday symptoms of an ulcer include burning stomach pain, heartburn and bloating, according to Mayo Clinic . But some people develop more troubling symptoms, like nausea, vomiting or dizziness. Elevation can make GI conditions, like ulcers, worse, according to a 2022 review from exercise scientists at The University of New Mexico. This may be because a change in air pressure affects the amount of vital oxygen available to the body's cells, the authors wrote. If your gut cells have less oxygen, they might not produce the same amount of protective coating that they normally do - which is the body's natural defense against stomach acid and ulcer. Even temporary changes in elevation that happen over the course of a flight could be enough to disrupt your gut, a 2014 study from the University of Zurich found. Despite popular ideas that pin the condition on stress or coffee, ulcers are usually caused by a bacteria, called H. Pylori, according to Mayo Clinic. You can get this bug by contact with an infected person, or bad food or water. Doctors don't quite understand how the bacteria causes ulcers, but estimate that it behind the roughly 4 million cases of the problem in the US. Smoking, drinking alcohol or using over the counter pain medicines like aspirin or Advil can all increase your likelihood of developing an ulcer. Tyson will take on Jake Paul in his return to the ring on Netflix later this year. One study , which looked at data from over 50 million hospitalizations, found that Americans who regularly used cannabis were 18 percent more likely to have ulcers as compared to those who didn't use the drug. Mr Tyson is the founder of Tyson 2.0 a weed company that is worth an estimated $400 million dollars. The entrepreneur has been known to smoke $40,000 worth of pot a month from his California cannabis ranch. It's such a common habit of his, in fact, that he publicly swore it off in previous months to prepare for his July match against Mr Paul. Whatever caused Mr Tyson's ulcer, it might be a dangerous liability ahead of his first fight in years. There's no official recommendation for when professional fighters should put down the gloves. There's no official recommendation for when professional fighters should put down the gloves, and anyone who steps into the boxing ring is at risk for brain damage, Dr. Gail Rosseau, a neurosurgeon at North Shore University Health System in Illinois, told the Grio . But those stakes become much higher as a fighter ages. 'The older you are when you sustain a traumatic brain injury [as in boxing], the less likely you are to recover to your pre-injury status,' Dr Rosseau said. She added: 'the typical time course for recovery from the same blow is longer in the older age group.'

        "content": "May 27, (THEWILL) – Alexer Perez Gopa, the estranged wife of Harrison Tare Okiri, aka Harrysong, has fired back at the singer over his recent claims about her. The singer recently accused her of infidelity, claiming she got pregnant for another man while they were still married. But in a series of posts on her Insta stories, Alexer denied the claims made by Harrysong. In the now-deleted posts, she also alleged that the singer is always broke because he is a chronic cheat. Alexer claimed he infected her with sexually transmitted diseases as a result of his infidelity. She asked the singer to come forward with evidence of her infidelity, adding that she was ready to undergo a DNA test for all her children. Alexer also made several allegations against Harrysong, claiming he bedwets. “Do you all know that Harrysong bedwets? Yes, celebrity wey dey piss for body. Oh, so sorry to break it to u all. I also get to deal with this daily, while calling him my lord. You said I convinced you to get married to me? A 20-year-old girl, convincing a full-grown man to get married to her? “Please make me understand, never knew I was married to a robot who couldn’t make decisions for himself. Same you who told me your ex-girlfriend used charms on you and now your eyes are open since u met me. So, it’s now me that forced marriage on you, really? I never knew my mum married 6 husbands wow, chronic. My mum only remarried when she lost her husband, as I speak, she is happily married with her dowry paid in full. “Since when did it become a crime for a widow to remarry? And what do the words “till do us part” mean? Pained soul, why are you trying to project your insecurities on me? We all know your mum gave birth to 6 children for 6 different men. None of which she was married to. And you, a product of incest. Imagine having 5 siblings and you don’t know who their fathers are. Why throw stones when you live in a glass house? “Wait, did you just say my mum lives in an uncompleted building? Please, you all can go and verify. My mum is sitting comfortably in the house her husband built, let us not forget the house she built for herself. Now Harrysong show me your house, the only legacy your dad left on earth is a mud house which you have no plans of renovating. “Ever since I knew you, we have been on rent. A reasonable man will sit down with his wife and plan a future but Harrison’s plans are always centred on women. If I start to mention the amount of side fowls, both old and young, I know, Instagram will not even contain the names. They even go as far as calling me to threaten me because of you. Harrison is always broke because he is a chronic cheat. “Now let’s come to me, if you are a man or men that I had sexual relations with while I was married to Harrysong, please step forward with evidence. And if there is any way we can run a DNA test on all my kids, including the one I lost, I am open to it because I fear nothing. A clear conscience fears no accusation. “Like I said, you keep projecting your insecurities on me. Harrison, how many times did I get to treat STDs because of you? The only sexually transmitted infections I did not get to treat weekly were HIV and Hepatitis B. You are on Nedu’s podcast spewing shit about me, same Nedu that you warned me about. Same Nedu you said was cunning and was a bad friend when Soso got you arrested,” she wrote. Harrysong married Alexer in March 2021 and they have two children. Their marital crisis unfolded in January after an alleged WhatsApp chat between them surfaced on social media. The chat showed the singer asking his wife to abort a pregnancy. In another conversation, Alexer accused Harrysong of having several side chicks, which he admitted and claimed that they were better than her. The alleged chat, however, prompted a statement from Harrysong. The singer, in the statement, admitted that they were going through a marital crisis while pleading with the public to respect his family’s privacy. Alexer also opened up about their marital issues, adding that Harrysong abused her verbally and physically.",

        "description": "Donald Trump has been vocally against most, if not all, of what Amber Rose stands for.The post Why Amber Rose Is Getting Hate For Supporting Trump 2024 appeared first on HotNewHipHop.",
        "content": "has recently come under hot water due to in the 2024 presidential election. This endorsement marks a significant departure from her previous criticisms of Trump. Furthermore, it has sparked a heated response from her followers and the public. Known for her strong advocacy for women’s rights and anti-racism, people have found it shocking that Amber would support a man who goes against everything she has been fighting for. , and has continued to defend her choice to support Trump. On May 20, 2024, Amber Rose posted a photo on Instagram with former President Donald Trump and his wife Melania Trump, captioning it: “Trump 2024, along with three US flag emojis.” The photo immediately prompted backlash. Critics of the photo and Rose’s stand were quick to point out the apparent hypocrisy, especially given Trump's history with women's rights and issues related to racism. They also pointed out that Trump had a history of misogynistic statements and policies that have been harmful to the causes she claims to support. Not to mention, Amber Rose herself has criticized Trump in the past. In a 2016 interview with , she labeled Trump an “idiot.” Moreover, she stated that she had hoped he would not be president. “He’s a f*cking idiot,” she said. “He’s so weird. I really hope he’s not president.” Similarly, some of Amber Rose’s tweets, where she was criticizing Trump, have resurfaced. In these tweets, she also likened Trump to trash and called him a sexual predator. This past condemnation makes her recent endorsement even more perplexing to many of her fans. Amber Rose is quite known for her advocacy for certain causes. These include: feminism and women’s rights, as well as the LGBTQ+ community, and anti-racism. She has organized numerous “SlutWalk” marches, which have helped raise awareness on ending rape culture. She has also been a vocal advocate for racial equality. As a mixed-race and bisexual woman, Amber has stood for these causes throughout the years. So what’s changed all of a sudden? Following Amber Rose’s post, fans and critics have highlighted that Trump stands against everything she has worked for. Some fans noted Trump's involvement in appointing Supreme Court justices who contributed to the overturning of Roe v. Wade, a landmark decision that protected women's reproductive rights. This decision has been seen as a significant setback for women's rights in the U.S. Former President Donald Trump has also garnered significant support within predominantly white and conservative Christian communities. Additionally, he has a history of racially insensitive remarks and policies that are harmful to BIPOC Americans. Notably, Trump has also been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women, and Amber Rose is well aware of this. After all, she has also labeled him a sexual predator. Therefore, her outright support for him is even more controversial. Many have expressed disappointment and disbelief, with some suggesting that her endorsement undermines her previous work, as well as her public stance on women's issues. In response to the backlash, Amber Rose commented under a post from . She argued that people should do their research, and suggested that Trump offers a more reasonable stance on certain issues, compared to other political figures. She also defended her position by claiming she would always put women first. “Lmaooo yall think Biden cares about black ppl??? Sad. Do ur research. I did. I’ll ALWAYS put women first... Trump supports the most reasonable compromise on abortion. Stop being brainwashed cuz WE’RE ppl of color. Make your own decisions.” Her response has only fanned the flames of criticism even more. In response to the claims that Trump is anti-LGBTQ, Amber Rose posted a 1998 video of Trump claiming to be “all for guys that like men.” However, this has continued to rake in more criticism. Amber Rose is being accused of grasping at straws, especially since Trump has been vocally against most, if not all of what she stands for. [ ] [ ]",

        "content": "LONDON, United Kingdom, May 27 – Chelsea are in talks to appoint Leicester City manager Enzo Maresca as the replacement for Mauricio Pochettino. The Italian, 44, took charge of the Foxes in June 2023 and has just led them back to the Premier League by winning the Championship at the first attempt. Maresca is interested in moving to Chelsea, with talks continuing between the two clubs, 24 hours after Ipswich Town manager Kieran McKenna dropped out of the race for the role. However, former Brighton manager Roberto de Zerbi and Brentford’s Thomas Frank have not been fully ruled out. Chelsea would have to pay compensation fees for any of their remaining options. BBC Sport understands Leicester would be seeking £8m-£10m in compensation for Maresca, who served his coaching apprenticeship as Pep Guardiola’s assistant at Manchester City. Whether the deal gets done would be dependent on Chelsea’s willingness to pay such a fee. Chelsea hope to finalise an appointment this week – subject to talks over the compensation package. Pochettino left the club by mutual consent last week after finishing sixth in the Premier League in his one season in charge. Former Manchester United assistant manager McKenna, who led Ipswich to promotion from the Championship, is being linked with Brighton, as well as with a return to Old Trafford if the FA Cup winners sack Erik ten Hag. Ipswich want to keep hold of McKenna and are expected to offer him a new contract – although he is unlikely to renew his deal. He is contracted to Ipswich until 2027 and any club will need to pay at least £4m compensation.",

        "content": "White House issues stark warning to Israel over 'devastating' air strike on Rafah that killed two senior Hamas terrorists and dozens of civilians as Middle East tensions boil 'The devastating images following an IDF strike in Rafah last night that killed dozens of innocent Palestinians are heartbreaking,' White House said READ MORE: Israeli troops exchange fire with Egyptian soldiers By Emily Goodin, Senior U.S. Political Reporter At The White House Published: 19:05, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 19:17, 27 May 2024 e-mail 30 View comments The White House on Monday issued a warning to Israel over an air strike that killed dozens of people in a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah. 'The devastating images following an IDF strike in Rafah last night that killed dozens of innocent Palestinians are heartbreaking,' a spokesperson for President Joe Biden 's National Security Council said. 'Israel has a right to go after Hamas , and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians. But as we've been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians. We are actively engaging the IDF and partners on the ground to assess what happened, and understand that the IDF is conducting an investigation.' At least 45 people were killed by the blast and subsequent fires, according to the Gaza health ministry, including 23 women, children and older people. The ministry said that 249 people were wounded. Israel's strike on Rafah killed at least 45 civilians Yassin Rabia, a Hamas commander, and Khaled Nagar, another senior Hamas official, were the targets and were killed. Israel's military said it was investigating the civilian deaths. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the civilian deaths a 'tragic accident.' Netanyahu said the Israeli Defense Forces tried to minimize civilian deaths by asking Gazans to evacuate, but 'despite our supreme effort not to harm uninvolved civilians, a tragic accident occurred to our regret last night.' He accused Hamas of hiding among the general population, saying: 'For us, every uninvolved civilian who is hurt is a tragedy. For Hamas it's a strategy. That's the whole difference.' The strike caused a fire that blazed through the camp in the Rafah governorate's Tal Al-Sultan area, reducing tents and shelters to ashes. Footage released by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society showed chaotic nighttime scenes of ambulances racing to the attack site and evacuating the wounded, including children. As Palestinians cleared the site on Monday, only blackened metal sheeting and charred planks remained, the tent shelters having been all but obliterated. The strike came after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to immediately halt its offensive of Rafah and officials are trying to restart ceasefire negotiations. A Palestinian man and his children sit in a destroyed room following the targeting or a residential building by an Israeli airstrike in Rafah in the southern Gaza President Joe Biden's administration admonished Israel over the attack It caused caused international outrage. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was 'outraged' over Israel's latest attacks. 'These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,' he said on X. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling must be respected. 'International humanitarian law applies for all, also for Israel's conduct of the war,' Baerbock said. Additionally, Israeli forces exchanged gunfire with Egyptian troops along their shared border that resulted in the death of at least one Egyptian soldier. The IDF this afternoon reported a 'shooting incident' at the border close to the crossing into Gaza, adding that it was discussing the issue with the Egyptian authorities but revealed no further information. 'A few hours ago, a shooting incident occurred on the Egyptian border. The incident is under review and discussions are being held with the Egyptians,' the military said this afternoon in a statement. Cairo quickly confirmed the shooting as a military spokesman said authorities had opened an investigation into the incident.

The storms, so far, have killed at least 21 people, after tornadoes and severe weather struck the central and southern United States. Among them were four children, spurring a statewide emergency declaration in Kentucky, as the mass of severe weather is set to move east Monday. More than 100million people across the East Coast are thus at risk, including the Tristate - where thunderstorms and possibly even a tornado are in the forecast. New York City will be under a red alert from 6pm Monday due to the threat of severe thunderstorms - which is expected to last into the early hours of Tuesday. People in the Big Apple will experience torrential rain, hail, and gusty winds, and hail - which may produce flash flooding. Seven people have died in northern Texas , eight in Arkansas, two in Oklahoma and four in Kentucky - with a fifth person 'fighting for their life,' the Blue Grass State's governor revealed in a press conference called Monday. Scroll down for video: A tornado spins in Eddyville, Kentucky, Sunday - part of a system of severe weather that's so far killed at least 21 people in four states Seven are dead in northern Texas, wreckage was strewn across a property Sunday the day after a deadly series of tornados hit Valley View and much of the rest of the central United States 'Sadly we can confirm that we have lost at least four Kentuckians from last night's storm,' Gov. Andy Beshear said at the emergency conference from the Kentucky Emergency Operations Center. 'That means we know that there are at least four families this morning that have suffered the loss of a loved one less than 24 hours ago that are hurting. 'We ought to rally around them and do everything we can to carry them and the days the weeks and the years to come,' he added - before revealing the uncertain fate for the fifth person is 'fighting for their life.' The four fatalities included a 67-year-old woman in Mercer County, a 62-year-old woman in Hardin County, a 48-year-old woman in Hopkins County, and a 34-year-old man in Jefferson County - all of whom went unnamed. The update brought the nationwide death toll over the Memorial Day Weekend up to 21, after a woman and two of her children saw their home struck by a tornado Saturday night in Valley View, Texas, killing all three. 'It was a really terrible thing,' Benito Esparza, the sole survivor's brother, told CNN in Spanish Monday, of the fate of sister-in-law Laura Esparza and her children Marco, 10, and Miranda, 16. His brother, Refugio Esparza, survived the tornado, but suffered a broken leg and pelvis. 'He lost three people, his wife and two kids,' Benito Esparza said. 'It's not easy.' The mass of severe weather is now set to move east, leaving more than 100million across the East Coast in places like New York City (seen here Monday Morning) are at risk One of at least 20 powerful tornadoes spotted Saturday and Sunday - this one seen in North Texas later Saturday in Cooke County Another eight have died in Arkansas, two in Oklahoma and four in Kentucky - with a fifth person 'fighting for their life' in the Blue Grass State, Gov. Andy Beshear revealed in a press conference called Monday. The update brought the nationwide death toll over the Memorial Day Weekend up to 21, after a woman and two of her kids saw their home struck by a tornado Saturday night in Valley View, Texas. Pictured: Laura Esparza (center) and kids Miranda, 16, and Marco, 10 He added how two of Refugio's older children were not at the home at the time of the tornado, which first surfaced outside the Dallas-Fort Worth area overnight Saturday, and saw at least seven killed. That made it the deadliest tornado in state history since 2015 - leaving residents to dig through the tons of rubble and debris left behind. That distinction was not lost on Benito, who spent Monday morning sifting through the remains of his brother's home for what was left. 'It's a very big disaster for everyone, as you can see,' said Esparza of storm's ongoing effect, as recovery efforts to continue. He further recalled how his three family members died after their trailer was thrusted across a street - a scene that was sadly not unique across the country Saturday and Sunday. There were more than 20 tornado reports within that span ranging from Texas to Missouri, bolstered by several detailing the damage left behind and, of course, the casualties. Elsewhere in Texas, violent storms overtook 18-wheelers, destroyed homes, and brought down power lines - even crushing a Shell station in Cooke County. This left 125 people trapped for a period Saturday night, officials said - revealing how all miraculously were retrieved uninjured. Several of the deaths were reported in Valley View in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park That made it the deadliest tornado in state history since 2015 - leaving residents to dig through the tons of rubble and debris left behind. The area as it was Sunday, as recovery efforts persist Also hit was nearby Denton County, where search and recovery efforts are still underway There, the storms inflicted some of their worst damage - in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas. The system then threatened to bring more violent weather to parts of the Midwest, affecting counties in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kentucky. A slew of deaths in those states were recorded Sunday, mostly from falling trees. One such death was confirmed in Mercer County early Monday, before the governor confirmed four overall had died. That person was pronounced dead along with another in Louisville , where Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed it was a storm-related death. Hours later, the state's governor revealed the tally was up to four - a number that very well could still rise, he said. The trees and homes damaged in those states were hit not only by tornados, but by winds that reached 135mph in some places, leaving some 500,000 without electricity across Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kentucky, and Texas. Out of the 21 who died, seven of the storm-related deaths came from Cooke County, Texas, as well as eight across a range of areas in Arkansas. Juana Landeros, who rode out deadly tornado with her husband and her 9-year-old son when it rolled through the previous night, salvages items from her destroyed home Sunday More damage in Denton county is seen here, as much of the central US was not spared by the twisters A man looks at a damaged car after a tornado hit the day before, Sunday in savaged Valley View The storms left a wide trail of destruction Sunday, before moving northeast into Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky Guadalupe Virgin statue lays among the rubble of a destroyed home in Valley View, which was one of the town's most affected by the tornados and more than 100pmh winds Wreckage is strewn across a property the day after a deadly series of tornados hit the central United States, in an aerial view over the north Texas town near Oklahoma Several cars are seen heavily damaged outside the remains of a Shell gas station, after it collapsed in on itself trapping more than 100 people taking shelter. Miraculously, they all survived unscathed, officials said Another two were recorded in Oklahoma's Mayes County, where trees have been uprooted by twisters all over town, with powerlines down and structures flattened. In Arkansas, The National Weather Service in Tulsa said a survey team found EF-3 damage near the town of Decatur, where at least one tornado hit. Another two hit Beaver Lake and others in Benton County, where three of the eight casualties were recorded. A 26-year-old woman, moreover, was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, as recovery efforts in all four states continue. In addition to the incident described by Esparza, the dead in Texas included two other children, ages 2 and 5, and three other family members also found together in a tornado-struck home in Cooke County. The severe weather, meanwhile, is not over, after it pushed east into the Midwest and the Ohio Valley over the course of Sunday. Missouri was the state hit hardest Sunday, where residents of Mehlville reported a violent storm and possible tornado that destroyed dozens of houses. This saw cities like Chicago, Indianapolis, Nashville, Tennessee, St. Louis, and Cincinnati hit by strong showers and damaging winds, but no tornados, as of writing. It is set to finish off today over the East Coast, where risk of severe weather was issued to mid-Atlantic strongholds such as Baltimore; Washington, D.C.; and Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina. Damage is seen to Tom Jones' home after the roof blew off during a storm Sunday in nearby Claremore, a community just across the border in Oklahoma view storm damage to their next door neighbor's home in the small town, which is located in the foothills of the Ozark Mountains People view more of the storm damage Sunday in the same community, after the weather moved east to other states Two deaths were recorded in Oklahoma's Mayes County (seen here Sunday), where trees have been uprooted by twisters all over town, with powerlines down and structures flattened People view the damage at the town's First Baptist Church, after a curfew was put into effect the night before Businesses in Arkansas were also damaged from the storm, with Home Town Flea Market in Rodgers left in ruins Sunday Eight people overall died as a result of the weather in the state, which left the city in Benton county 'unrecognizable', officials said Missouri was the state hit hardest Sunday, where residents of Mehlville reported a violent storm and possible tornado that destroyed dozens of houses Meanwhile, clean-ups in several counties in those five states continue, as officials continue to look for any others hurt by the disasters There, 27 million people are at risk of strong to severe thunderstorms, with more than 110 million people are at risk of severe weather in general. That includes south of New England, where there is a level 2 out of 5 threat. Meanwhile, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, DC, are at risk for tornadoes, but the chances for any to develop are low, officials said. The travel hubs of Atlanta, New York, and Philadelphia will also have to contend with the prospect of damaging storms, and even the odd tornado. This will likely lead to delayed or canceled flights Monday, as Memorial Day winds to a close. Travelers are urged to check the current weather conditions of the states they are heading to.

        "content": "New formations of soldiers and “expanded activities” at depots and warehouses north of Kharkiv (Image: Getty) Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded permission to strike with Western missiles as ‘thousands’ of Russian troops mass on the Ukrainian northern border. New formations of soldiers and “expanded activities” at depots and warehouses in settlements north of Ukraine ’s second city, Kharkiv , have been identified by the Institute of War Studies. Volodymyr Zelensky warned that “thousands” of troops were preparing for a fresh assault, and issued a fresh plea to the West to allow them to fire Western missiles into Russia to halt the advance. A US think tank, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) , however, concluded that the build-up may also be to “stretch and fix Ukrainian forces” which are struggling to hold positions across the front lines. function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) READ MORE: Ukraine dealt blow as Putin's troops claim to have captured key village [LATEST] On a visit to Spain on Monday, Mr Zelensky secured another £850,000 military aid package (Image: Getty) Ukrainian officials are frustrated that they have been banned from striking targets inside Russia with Western missiles, arguing that this has given Russian forces a safe area to prepare ground attacks and fire missiles at Ukrainian cities. Following an attack toward Kharkiv on 10th May, officials have warned that the Kremlin also plans to attack Sumy, which lies 100 miles from Kharkiv. On 3rd May, the UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron said it was up to Ukraine to decide how to use British weapons and insisted it had a right to strike targets on Russian territory. Meanwhile, over the weekend Poland and Sweden gave permission for Ukraine to hit targets inside Russia , along with the secretary general of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg. Pressure is now building on the US to follow the UK, despite concerns that this will escalate the war. Germany and Italy have both ruled out such permission. Don't miss...

On a visit to Spain on Monday, Mr Zelensky secured another £850,000 military aid package but the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sanchez , did not give Ukrainian commanders permission to fire Spanish weapons at Russia . “Spain has been supporting Ukraine for two years. Unfortunately, Russian aggression continues and we have to increase our support,” Mr Sanchez said at a joint press conference. So far, Ukraine has been using domestic drones to hit targets across Russia , mainly oil refineries, railways and military airfields. However, on Monday, sources confirmed that it had struck a Russian nuclear radar station near the border with Kazakhstan, 1,000 miles away. This became the second Ukrainian strike against Russia ’s nuclear missile infrastructure in four days, which comes as a concern to its Western allies, who are worried about further escalation .
