He was received by the chairman of the Yaosoeng Sugar and Cane Consultant Company, Prapat Jenlapwattanakul and his team, the landowners, community leaders, and the people of Cocolands. Mr Maru described his visit as ‘‘a very useful visit’’. After visiting the project site, Mr Maru said: “I do appreciate that there is enough grassland for the project, there is enough State land to build the sugar mill, and the local people are very supportive of this project.” Mr Maru explained the processes that will now follow which include putting together a NEC Submission before the cabinet for endorsement. ‘‘The Cabinet will basically approve that the Government must support this project and it will be developed as an SEZ meaning the company will be given incentives to invest here including tax holiday and duty-free exemptions. ‘‘This is subject to phase two which is negotiations between the company, the landowners, the DDA, the LLGs, the local MP, the Provincial Government, and the State, to agree to the elements of the project like benefits for landowners, new wharf, power supply, etc which will be captured in the project agreement. The project agreement will be signed and subject to the negotiations. ‘‘After the signing of the project agreement, the State will give the land title to the company. ‘‘The company will need the title to have security of land tenure so they can go to the banks to raise capital to build the sugar mill and to start this project. ‘‘The shareholders of this project the State through Kumul Consolidated Holdings, the provincial government, and other investors,” Mr Maru explained. The proposal is for a 40, 000-hectare sugar farm, a processing mill, and a power plant. This follows a successful trial in Abau on the proposed sugar farm land. The plantation will produce 3 million tonnes of sugar every year with the target market to be PNG and other countries, especially Indonesia.",

        "description": "More than half of the state’s perfect scorers have come from the Latur division",
        "content": "The dominance of the Latur pattern was evident again in this year's , as it registered the highest number of students in the state scoring 100 per cent marks. This year, the Latur division produced 123 students who scored cent percent marks in the SSC board examination, which is more than half of the total 187 students across the state who achieved a perfect score. This success did not happen suddenly or by chance. For over two decades, teachers and educational institutes in the Marathwada region have worked hard and evolved a system—popularly called the ‘Latur Pattern’—which has helped hundreds and thousands of students crack competitive exams like NEET and IIT-JEE and get good grades in class X and XII board exams. ADVERTISEMENT Despite the Latur division securing a seventh position among the nine divisional boards in Maharashtra with respect to overall pass percentage, its overall pass percentage this year is 95.27 per cent. However, known as a \"topper factory\" in academic circles, the Latur division lived up to its nickname even this year. Building on the much-talked-about ‘Latur pattern,’ schools across the district have managed to secure a strong presence in the elite ‘100 per cent club,’ year after year, a phenomenon that has been especially evident in the state board results post-2016 after the state education department introduced bonus marks for art and culture for the Class X exams. The state board awards extra marks to students for their remarkable achievements in the fields of art and sports in the SSC board exams. For the past few years, the state board has been declaring results based on the best of five subjects. This year, a total of 187 students achieved a perfect 100 per cent score. Division-wise, Latur had the highest number with 123 students, followed by with 32, and Pune with 10. Mumbai had eight students, Amravati had seven, while Kolhapur and Konkan each had three. Nagpur had one student, and Nashik had none. Last year, of the 151 students with 100 percent, 109 were from Latur, while six were from Mumbai. In 2022, 70 students from Latur scored 100 percent among the 122 from across the state. Of these, Pune had five and Mumbai had one student who scored 100 per cent that year. In 2020, of the 242 students who scored a perfect 100 across the nine divisions in the state, 151 were from the Latur division. In 2018, 125 students scored 100 percent marks, of which 68 were from Latur alone. The Latur pattern of study is a model that gained prominence during the 1980s as an initiative by a group of dedicated academics in the district, who aimed to enhance the quality of education in the region. After the district was established in 1982, schools and colleges began actively training students with parental support to improve learning outcomes. “It is an old model started by a group of educationists and passed on to the new generation, followed to date. The term ‘Latur pattern,’ however, was coined when the then education minister Vilasrao Deshmukh used it while felicitating meritorious students at an event during that time,\" said a teacher from a Zilla Parishad school in Latur. An official from the state board said, \"The Latur pattern has been successful for years. While it has produced many high-scoring students, we are now focusing on improving outcomes for all students. Over the years, the overall pass percentage in the division has been declining, and we are actively working to reverse this trend.\"",

        "content": "Revenue worth $100 million to be generated through the export: PTC ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tobacco Company Limited (PTC) has announced the launch of its ‘Made in Pakistan 3.0’ initiative, marking a significant milestone in the company’s history of economic contribution. This initiative aims to export PTC’s modern oral tobacco-free nicotine pouches, Velo, to Japan, potentially generating $100 million annually through all its exports, as estimated by PTC. The launch event was attended by Federal Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan, along with guests from both the public and private sectors and members of the media. Recognized as Pakistan’s first multinational company, PTC has been a cornerstone of the nation’s economy. Over the past five years, the company has contributed over Rs 680 billion to the national exchequer, earning the prestigious ‘Highest Taxpayers Award’ in 2024 in recognition of its substantial fiscal contributions. In April 2019, PTC embarked on its ‘Made in Pakistan’ initiative, aligned with the Government of Pakistan’s export ambitions, focusing on exporting cigarettes and processed tobacco to various countries. This venture has generated over $157 million since its inception, significantly bolstering the Pakistani economy. Building on this success, the ‘Made in Pakistan 3.0’ initiative aims to further enhance Pakistan’s economic standing. The introduction of nicotine pouches to the Japanese market represents a pivotal step in PTC’s commitment to innovation and growth, potentially adding an additional $50 million annually through foreign exchange earnings. Federal Minister Jam Kamal stated, “Today marks a new chapter in PTC’s history. The ‘Made in Pakistan 3.0’ initiative not only exemplifies PTC’s dedication to economic progress but also showcases Pakistan’s capability to produce high-quality, innovative products for the global market.” Minister Kamal added, “Pakistan has always been an ideal destination for foreign investors. The government is doing its best to facilitate large-scale investors at all levels. Today’s event is a testimony to the government’s extended support under the premiership of PM Mian Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif.” British American Tobacco Group’s Regional Director for Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa, Michael Dijanosic, remarked, “It is a proud moment as PTC prepares to export modern oral nicotine pouches to key markets like Japan. This achievement highlights our strong partnership and marks a major step forward for both BAT and Pakistan. Expanding into international markets creates new revenue streams and opportunities, reinforcing our position as global leaders.” PTC’s Managing Director and CEO, Ali Akbar, added, “We are thrilled to expand our reach with Velo and contribute further to the economic development of Pakistan. Our commitment to excellence and innovation drives us to continuously seek new opportunities and markets. I would like to further request the Government of Pakistan to continue extending their valuable support by framing the right regulatory and fiscal regime for this segment, enabling it to flourish. Sensible regulations will certainly determine the long-term success and sustainability of this business.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

        "content": "How Mike Tyson's mystery illness could be deadly... and what it means for his upcoming fight against Jake Paul READ MORE: Mike Tyson, 57, suffers medical scare during flight to Los Angeles By Maiya Focht For Dailymail.Com Published: 14:09 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 14:26 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Fans of heavyweight champion fighter Mike Tyson , 57, are concerned about his health following an alarming scare on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles on Sunday . Tyson, who is set to fight 27 year old Jake Paul in a mere two months, became inexplicably dizzy and nauseous — symptoms that are said to be linked to an ulcer, thought to be in his abdomen. Paramedics boarded the plane in California to deliver immediate medical attention to Mr Tyson. The debacle has led to speculation as to what exactly has happened to cause these odd symptoms, and whether or not it means he will have to delay the long-awaited fight. Concerningly, some research suggests that Tyson could be at risk of developing a more sinister condition, including a catastrophic internal bleed. Mike Tyson suffered a medical scare during a flight from Miami to Los Angeles on Sunday. Stomach ulcers are small sores that develop on the lining of the stomach or small intestine and can cause a host of GI symptoms, from nausea and bloating to vomiting and dizziness. One of the most severe and rare complications of an ulcer is the potential for the sore to turn into a rupture - splitting your stomach or colon open in what's called a perforation, according to the NIH . This is a rare complication, affecting approximately 2 to 14 percent of people with ulcers. When the stomach or colon splits open, the acid and bacteria that they normally contains may spill out into the body, which can lead to a life-threatening condition known as sepsis. Initial symptoms can present a bit like a fever, causing dizziness, nausea and a high temperature. An ulcer stomach perforation and is fatal in about 30 percent of cases. The risk may be a concern to Tyson's doctors, as being hit in the stomach can also cause perforation, particularly in ulcerated regions. Having an ulcer or getting punched in the stomach, 'doesn’t mean you will have a gastrointestinal perforation, but your risk of having one is higher,' according to doctors from the Cleveland Clinic wrote . GOT A HEALTH-RELATED STORY? EMAIL: Health@dailymail.com Advertisement However, more likely is simply that the altitude made the typical symptoms of an abdominal ulcer much worse. The everyday symptoms of an ulcer include burning stomach pain, heartburn and bloating, according to Mayo Clinic . But some people develop more troubling symptoms, like nausea, vomiting or dizziness. Elevation can make GI conditions, like ulcers, worse, according to a 2022 review from exercise scientists at The University of New Mexico. This may be because a change in air pressure affects the amount of vital oxygen available to the body's cells, the authors wrote. If your gut cells have less oxygen, they might not produce the same amount of protective coating that they normally do - which is the body's natural defense against stomach acid and ulcer. Even temporary changes in elevation that happen over the course of a flight could be enough to disrupt your gut, a 2014 study from the University of Zurich found. Despite popular ideas that pin the condition on stress or coffee, ulcers are usually caused by a bacteria, called H. Pylori, according to Mayo Clinic. You can get this bug by contact with an infected person, or bad food or water. Doctors don't quite understand how the bacteria causes ulcers, but estimate that it behind the roughly 4 million cases of the problem in the US. Smoking, drinking alcohol or using over the counter pain medicines like aspirin or Advil can all increase your likelihood of developing an ulcer. Tyson will take on Jake Paul in his return to the ring on Netflix later this year. One study , which looked at data from over 50 million hospitalizations, found that Americans who regularly used cannabis were 18 percent more likely to have ulcers as compared to those who didn't use the drug. Mr Tyson is the founder of Tyson 2.0 a weed company that is worth an estimated $400 million dollars. The entrepreneur has been known to smoke $40,000 worth of pot a month from his California cannabis ranch. It's such a common habit of his, in fact, that he publicly swore it off in previous months to prepare for his July match against Mr Paul. Whatever caused Mr Tyson's ulcer, it might be a dangerous liability ahead of his first fight in years. There's no official recommendation for when professional fighters should put down the gloves. There's no official recommendation for when professional fighters should put down the gloves, and anyone who steps into the boxing ring is at risk for brain damage, Dr. Gail Rosseau, a neurosurgeon at North Shore University Health System in Illinois, told the Grio . But those stakes become much higher as a fighter ages. 'The older you are when you sustain a traumatic brain injury [as in boxing], the less likely you are to recover to your pre-injury status,' Dr Rosseau said. She added: 'the typical time course for recovery from the same blow is longer in the older age group.'

        "content": "May 27, (THEWILL) – Alexer Perez Gopa, the estranged wife of Harrison Tare Okiri, aka Harrysong, has fired back at the singer over his recent claims about her. The singer recently accused her of infidelity, claiming she got pregnant for another man while they were still married. But in a series of posts on her Insta stories, Alexer denied the claims made by Harrysong. In the now-deleted posts, she also alleged that the singer is always broke because he is a chronic cheat. Alexer claimed he infected her with sexually transmitted diseases as a result of his infidelity. She asked the singer to come forward with evidence of her infidelity, adding that she was ready to undergo a DNA test for all her children. Alexer also made several allegations against Harrysong, claiming he bedwets. “Do you all know that Harrysong bedwets? Yes, celebrity wey dey piss for body. Oh, so sorry to break it to u all. I also get to deal with this daily, while calling him my lord. You said I convinced you to get married to me? A 20-year-old girl, convincing a full-grown man to get married to her? “Please make me understand, never knew I was married to a robot who couldn’t make decisions for himself. Same you who told me your ex-girlfriend used charms on you and now your eyes are open since u met me. So, it’s now me that forced marriage on you, really? I never knew my mum married 6 husbands wow, chronic. My mum only remarried when she lost her husband, as I speak, she is happily married with her dowry paid in full. “Since when did it become a crime for a widow to remarry? And what do the words “till do us part” mean? Pained soul, why are you trying to project your insecurities on me? We all know your mum gave birth to 6 children for 6 different men. None of which she was married to. And you, a product of incest. Imagine having 5 siblings and you don’t know who their fathers are. Why throw stones when you live in a glass house? “Wait, did you just say my mum lives in an uncompleted building? Please, you all can go and verify. My mum is sitting comfortably in the house her husband built, let us not forget the house she built for herself. Now Harrysong show me your house, the only legacy your dad left on earth is a mud house which you have no plans of renovating. “Ever since I knew you, we have been on rent. A reasonable man will sit down with his wife and plan a future but Harrison’s plans are always centred on women. If I start to mention the amount of side fowls, both old and young, I know, Instagram will not even contain the names. They even go as far as calling me to threaten me because of you. Harrison is always broke because he is a chronic cheat. “Now let’s come to me, if you are a man or men that I had sexual relations with while I was married to Harrysong, please step forward with evidence. And if there is any way we can run a DNA test on all my kids, including the one I lost, I am open to it because I fear nothing. A clear conscience fears no accusation. “Like I said, you keep projecting your insecurities on me. Harrison, how many times did I get to treat STDs because of you? The only sexually transmitted infections I did not get to treat weekly were HIV and Hepatitis B. You are on Nedu’s podcast spewing shit about me, same Nedu that you warned me about. Same Nedu you said was cunning and was a bad friend when Soso got you arrested,” she wrote. Harrysong married Alexer in March 2021 and they have two children. Their marital crisis unfolded in January after an alleged WhatsApp chat between them surfaced on social media. The chat showed the singer asking his wife to abort a pregnancy. In another conversation, Alexer accused Harrysong of having several side chicks, which he admitted and claimed that they were better than her. The alleged chat, however, prompted a statement from Harrysong. The singer, in the statement, admitted that they were going through a marital crisis while pleading with the public to respect his family’s privacy. Alexer also opened up about their marital issues, adding that Harrysong abused her verbally and physically.",

        "content": "White House issues stark warning to Israel over 'devastating' air strike on Rafah that killed two senior Hamas terrorists and dozens of civilians as Middle East tensions boil 'The devastating images following an IDF strike in Rafah last night that killed dozens of innocent Palestinians are heartbreaking,' White House said READ MORE: Israeli troops exchange fire with Egyptian soldiers By Emily Goodin, Senior U.S. Political Reporter At The White House Published: 19:05, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 19:17, 27 May 2024 e-mail 30 View comments The White House on Monday issued a warning to Israel over an air strike that killed dozens of people in a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah. 'The devastating images following an IDF strike in Rafah last night that killed dozens of innocent Palestinians are heartbreaking,' a spokesperson for President Joe Biden 's National Security Council said. 'Israel has a right to go after Hamas , and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians. But as we've been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians. We are actively engaging the IDF and partners on the ground to assess what happened, and understand that the IDF is conducting an investigation.' At least 45 people were killed by the blast and subsequent fires, according to the Gaza health ministry, including 23 women, children and older people. The ministry said that 249 people were wounded. Israel's strike on Rafah killed at least 45 civilians Yassin Rabia, a Hamas commander, and Khaled Nagar, another senior Hamas official, were the targets and were killed. Israel's military said it was investigating the civilian deaths. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the civilian deaths a 'tragic accident.' Netanyahu said the Israeli Defense Forces tried to minimize civilian deaths by asking Gazans to evacuate, but 'despite our supreme effort not to harm uninvolved civilians, a tragic accident occurred to our regret last night.' He accused Hamas of hiding among the general population, saying: 'For us, every uninvolved civilian who is hurt is a tragedy. For Hamas it's a strategy. That's the whole difference.' The strike caused a fire that blazed through the camp in the Rafah governorate's Tal Al-Sultan area, reducing tents and shelters to ashes. Footage released by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society showed chaotic nighttime scenes of ambulances racing to the attack site and evacuating the wounded, including children. As Palestinians cleared the site on Monday, only blackened metal sheeting and charred planks remained, the tent shelters having been all but obliterated. The strike came after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to immediately halt its offensive of Rafah and officials are trying to restart ceasefire negotiations. A Palestinian man and his children sit in a destroyed room following the targeting or a residential building by an Israeli airstrike in Rafah in the southern Gaza President Joe Biden's administration admonished Israel over the attack It caused caused international outrage. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was 'outraged' over Israel's latest attacks. 'These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,' he said on X. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling must be respected. 'International humanitarian law applies for all, also for Israel's conduct of the war,' Baerbock said. Additionally, Israeli forces exchanged gunfire with Egyptian troops along their shared border that resulted in the death of at least one Egyptian soldier. The IDF this afternoon reported a 'shooting incident' at the border close to the crossing into Gaza, adding that it was discussing the issue with the Egyptian authorities but revealed no further information. 'A few hours ago, a shooting incident occurred on the Egyptian border. The incident is under review and discussions are being held with the Egyptians,' the military said this afternoon in a statement. Cairo quickly confirmed the shooting as a military spokesman said authorities had opened an investigation into the incident.

        "content": "Deadly summer storms rain down on US: Twenty one dead in the South as NYC is put on 'red alert' The storms have killed at least 21 people across four states across the central US The mass of severe weather is set to move east Monday, affecting the East Coast T hunderstorms and possibly even a tornado are in the forecast for the Tristate By Alex Hammer For Dailymail.Com Published: 13:53 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 14:35 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 3 View comments Texas , Arkansas , Kentucky , Missouri and Tennessee were all hit over Memorial Day Weekend by a bevy of twisters, heavy winds and flooding. The storms, so far, have killed at least 21 people, after tornadoes and severe weather struck the central and southern United States. Among them were four children, spurring a statewide emergency declaration in Kentucky, as the mass of severe weather is set to move east Monday. More than 100million people across the East Coast are thus at risk, including the Tristate - where thunderstorms and possibly even a tornado are in the forecast. New York City will be under a red alert from 6pm Monday due to the threat of severe thunderstorms - which is expected to last into the early hours of Tuesday. People in the Big Apple will experience torrential rain, hail, and gusty winds, and hail - which may produce flash flooding. Seven people have died in northern Texas , eight in Arkansas, two in Oklahoma and four in Kentucky - with a fifth person 'fighting for their life,' the Blue Grass State's governor revealed in a press conference called Monday. Scroll down for video: A tornado spins in Eddyville, Kentucky, Sunday - part of a system of severe weather that's so far killed at least 21 people in four states Seven are dead in northern Texas, wreckage was strewn across a property Sunday the day after a deadly series of tornados hit Valley View and much of the rest of the central United States 'Sadly we can confirm that we have lost at least four Kentuckians from last night's storm,' Gov. Andy Beshear said at the emergency conference from the Kentucky Emergency Operations Center. 'That means we know that there are at least four families this morning that have suffered the loss of a loved one less than 24 hours ago that are hurting. 'We ought to rally around them and do everything we can to carry them and the days the weeks and the years to come,' he added - before revealing the uncertain fate for the fifth person is 'fighting for their life.' The four fatalities included a 67-year-old woman in Mercer County, a 62-year-old woman in Hardin County, a 48-year-old woman in Hopkins County, and a 34-year-old man in Jefferson County - all of whom went unnamed. The update brought the nationwide death toll over the Memorial Day Weekend up to 21, after a woman and two of her children saw their home struck by a tornado Saturday night in Valley View, Texas, killing all three. 'It was a really terrible thing,' Benito Esparza, the sole survivor's brother, told CNN in Spanish Monday, of the fate of sister-in-law Laura Esparza and her children Marco, 10, and Miranda, 16. His brother, Refugio Esparza, survived the tornado, but suffered a broken leg and pelvis. 'He lost three people, his wife and two kids,' Benito Esparza said. 'It's not easy.' The mass of severe weather is now set to move east, leaving more than 100million across the East Coast in places like New York City (seen here Monday Morning) are at risk One of at least 20 powerful tornadoes spotted Saturday and Sunday - this one seen in North Texas later Saturday in Cooke County Another eight have died in Arkansas, two in Oklahoma and four in Kentucky - with a fifth person 'fighting for their life' in the Blue Grass State, Gov. Andy Beshear revealed in a press conference called Monday. The update brought the nationwide death toll over the Memorial Day Weekend up to 21, after a woman and two of her kids saw their home struck by a tornado Saturday night in Valley View, Texas. Pictured: Laura Esparza (center) and kids Miranda, 16, and Marco, 10 He added how two of Refugio's older children were not at the home at the time of the tornado, which first surfaced outside the Dallas-Fort Worth area overnight Saturday, and saw at least seven killed. That made it the deadliest tornado in state history since 2015 - leaving residents to dig through the tons of rubble and debris left behind. That distinction was not lost on Benito, who spent Monday morning sifting through the remains of his brother's home for what was left. 'It's a very big disaster for everyone, as you can see,' said Esparza of storm's ongoing effect, as recovery efforts to continue. He further recalled how his three family members died after their trailer was thrusted across a street - a scene that was sadly not unique across the country Saturday and Sunday. There were more than 20 tornado reports within that span ranging from Texas to Missouri, bolstered by several detailing the damage left behind and, of course, the casualties. Elsewhere in Texas, violent storms overtook 18-wheelers, destroyed homes, and brought down power lines - even crushing a Shell station in Cooke County. This left 125 people trapped for a period Saturday night, officials said - revealing how all miraculously were retrieved uninjured. Several of the deaths were reported in Valley View in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park That made it the deadliest tornado in state history since 2015 - leaving residents to dig through the tons of rubble and debris left behind. The area as it was Sunday, as recovery efforts persist Also hit was nearby Denton County, where search and recovery efforts are still underway There, the storms inflicted some of their worst damage - in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas. The system then threatened to bring more violent weather to parts of the Midwest, affecting counties in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kentucky. A slew of deaths in those states were recorded Sunday, mostly from falling trees. One such death was confirmed in Mercer County early Monday, before the governor confirmed four overall had died. That person was pronounced dead along with another in Louisville , where Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed it was a storm-related death. Hours later, the state's governor revealed the tally was up to four - a number that very well could still rise, he said. The trees and homes damaged in those states were hit not only by tornados, but by winds that reached 135mph in some places, leaving some 500,000 without electricity across Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kentucky, and Texas. Out of the 21 who died, seven of the storm-related deaths came from Cooke County, Texas, as well as eight across a range of areas in Arkansas. Juana Landeros, who rode out deadly tornado with her husband and her 9-year-old son when it rolled through the previous night, salvages items from her destroyed home Sunday More damage in Denton county is seen here, as much of the central US was not spared by the twisters A man looks at a damaged car after a tornado hit the day before, Sunday in savaged Valley View The storms left a wide trail of destruction Sunday, before moving northeast into Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky Guadalupe Virgin statue lays among the rubble of a destroyed home in Valley View, which was one of the town's most affected by the tornados and more than 100pmh winds Wreckage is strewn across a property the day after a deadly series of tornados hit the central United States, in an aerial view over the north Texas town near Oklahoma Several cars are seen heavily damaged outside the remains of a Shell gas station, after it collapsed in on itself trapping more than 100 people taking shelter. Miraculously, they all survived unscathed, officials said Another two were recorded in Oklahoma's Mayes County, where trees have been uprooted by twisters all over town, with powerlines down and structures flattened. In Arkansas, The National Weather Service in Tulsa said a survey team found EF-3 damage near the town of Decatur, where at least one tornado hit. Another two hit Beaver Lake and others in Benton County, where three of the eight casualties were recorded. A 26-year-old woman, moreover, was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, as recovery efforts in all four states continue. In addition to the incident described by Esparza, the dead in Texas included two other children, ages 2 and 5, and three other family members also found together in a tornado-struck home in Cooke County. The severe weather, meanwhile, is not over, after it pushed east into the Midwest and the Ohio Valley over the course of Sunday. Missouri was the state hit hardest Sunday, where residents of Mehlville reported a violent storm and possible tornado that destroyed dozens of houses. This saw cities like Chicago, Indianapolis, Nashville, Tennessee, St. Louis, and Cincinnati hit by strong showers and damaging winds, but no tornados, as of writing. It is set to finish off today over the East Coast, where risk of severe weather was issued to mid-Atlantic strongholds such as Baltimore; Washington, D.C.; and Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina. Damage is seen to Tom Jones' home after the roof blew off during a storm Sunday in nearby Claremore, a community just across the border in Oklahoma view storm damage to their next door neighbor's home in the small town, which is located in the foothills of the Ozark Mountains People view more of the storm damage Sunday in the same community, after the weather moved east to other states Two deaths were recorded in Oklahoma's Mayes County (seen here Sunday), where trees have been uprooted by twisters all over town, with powerlines down and structures flattened People view the damage at the town's First Baptist Church, after a curfew was put into effect the night before Businesses in Arkansas were also damaged from the storm, with Home Town Flea Market in Rodgers left in ruins Sunday Eight people overall died as a result of the weather in the state, which left the city in Benton county 'unrecognizable', officials said Missouri was the state hit hardest Sunday, where residents of Mehlville reported a violent storm and possible tornado that destroyed dozens of houses Meanwhile, clean-ups in several counties in those five states continue, as officials continue to look for any others hurt by the disasters There, 27 million people are at risk of strong to severe thunderstorms, with more than 110 million people are at risk of severe weather in general. That includes south of New England, where there is a level 2 out of 5 threat. Meanwhile, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, DC, are at risk for tornadoes, but the chances for any to develop are low, officials said. The travel hubs of Atlanta, New York, and Philadelphia will also have to contend with the prospect of damaging storms, and even the odd tornado. This will likely lead to delayed or canceled flights Monday, as Memorial Day winds to a close. Travelers are urged to check the current weather conditions of the states they are heading to.

        "content": "A flood advisory was issued by the National Weather Service on Monday at 2:02 p.m. in effect until 4 p.m. for Bergen, Essex and Hudson counties. The weather service comments, \"Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.\" \"Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas,\" says the weather service. \"Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood deaths occur in vehicles. Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law enforcement and request they pass this information to the National Weather Service when you can do so safely.\" A flash flood warning is issued when a flash flood is imminent or occurring. If you are in a flood-prone area, move immediately to high ground. A flash flood is a sudden violent flood that can take from minutes to hours to develop. It is even possible to experience a flash flood in areas not immediately receiving rain. A flood warning is issued when flooding is imminent or occurring. A flood advisory is issued when flooding is not expected to be bad enough to issue a warning. However, it may cause significant inconvenience, and if caution is not exercised, it could lead to situations that may threaten life and/or property. A flood watch is issued when conditions are favorable for flooding. It doesn't guarantee that flooding will occur, but it signifies that the possibility exists. In flood-prone regions or while camping in low-lying areas, understanding and following the weather service flood safety guidelines can be a lifesaver: 1. Move to higher ground: 2. Adhere to evacuation orders: 3. Disconnect utilities and appliances: 4. Steer clear of flooded basements and submerged areas: 5. Swift evacuation for your safety: 6. Stay away from floodwaters: 7. Seek high ground if trapped: During periods of intense rainfall, the risk of flooding increases, particularly in low-lying and flood-prone areas. It is imperative to avoid driving through any water on the road, even if it seems shallow. According to the weather service, most cars can be swept away by just 12 inches of rushing water. Prioritize your safety by staying informed and prepared. When heavy rain sets in, the risk of flooding and hazardous driving conditions rises. Whether it's prolonged rainfall or rapid runoff, being prepared is essential. Here are some valuable safety tips from the weather service to ensure you stay safe in heavy rain: Beware of rapid water flow: Maintain safe driving distances: Slow down and stay cautious: Choose your lane wisely: Visibility matters: Watch out for slippery roads: Keep a safe distance from large vehicles: Mind your windshield wipers: By following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down. Stay informed about weather conditions and heed advice from local authorities to make your journey safe and sound.

(SMC) might still pursue the P81.53-billion Pasig River Expressway (Parex) as it puts the project only on hold for further review, taking into consideration the public’s opinion before proceeding. Ramon Ang, SMC president and CEO, told reporters on Monday in Pasay they were “clarifying” the concerns of the public about the project. “[If] it will benefit more people, why not,” he said when asked if they would still go ahead with the project after postponing it for further review.This showed Ang’s easing of stance about the tollway project as he previously said in March they were dropping it due to adverse public opinion. In 2021, the scientist group Advocates of Science and Technology for the People said the proposed elevated expressway would cause damage to the river as it would block the natural sunlight and “affect the remaining food chain of Pasig River.” Private-sector group Ilog Pasiglahin, in a statement in March, said it was critical to preserve the Pasig River as it is also connected to other bodies of water, including Manila Bay, Laguna de Bay, and the rivers of Marikina, San Juan, and Taguig. Toll Regulatory Board Executive Director Alvin Carullo told the media last week the project was on the final engineering design stage. The planned Parex project is a 19.37-kilometer six-lane expressway passing through the Pasig River from Radial Road 10 in Manila and the proposed South East Metro Manila Expressway at Circumferential Road 6.Following the cancellation of the Parex project, SMC announced they broke ground for the 76.8-km Pangasinan Link Expressway, which is seen to support economic activities by linking the eastern and western corridors of the province. —Tyrone Jasper C.

        "content": "Philippine National Bank (PNB) — INQUIRER.net photo MANILA, Philippines — Philippine National Bank (PNB) will be raising $300 million via a medium-term note offering, to build up its coffers for its financing requirements. In a disclosure on Monday, the Lucio Tan-led lender announced that its board had approved the issuance of the note, with an option to upsize, from its $2-billion euro medium-term note program. The bank, however, has yet to disclose further details about the offer period and interest rates attached to the notes, among others. PNB’s euro medium-term note program was established in 2018 to provide a funding source for the company. In 2019, the listed financial institution raised $750 million via the offshore bond market, drawing down from the program. The offered fixed-rate senior notes maturing by September 2024 have a coupon rate of 3.27 percent per annum. READ: PNB raises $750M via offshore bond issuance The bank also tapped the medium-term note program for the launch of $300-million fixed-rate senior note offerings with a coupon rate of 4.25 percent annually and a tenor of five years. Last month, credit watcher Moody’s Ratings affirmed the bank’s foreign currency senior unsecured medium-term note program rating at “(P)Baa3,” which means moderate credit risk. Moody’s also noted that PNB’s nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio has remained “stable” at 7.3 percent as of end-2023 compared to 7.2 percent in 2022. An NPL ratio indicates how much loans extended to clients have remained unpaid and a lower figure means less credit risk for the lender. Should NPLs rise, banks allocate a bigger credit loss provision, which will eventually hurt their bottom line. In the first quarter, PNB grew its net income by 10 percent to P5.3 million as interest income improved by 17 percent to P16.08 billion. Total assets stood at P1.196 trillion as of end-March, while net loans and receivables amounted to P610 billion and deposit liabilities reached P916.4 billion.

        "content": "A recent decision of the Supreme Court is cautionary to people who sign contracts without reading or understanding their content. The case involved a woman who died of hypertension shortly after she finished her exercise routine at a fitness center. Her husband sued the center for negligence on the grounds that it failed to take her blood pressure and for not having a doctor on-site at all times. The lower and appellate courts decided in favor of the husband, but the high court reversed their rulings and dismissed the claim for damages. It said the center was not negligent because she stated in her application that she was not suffering from hypertension despite her duty to inform it of any medical problem before engaging in any exercise activity. In addition, the center’s records and handouts to its members showed that it had no obligation to take their blood pressure and have a doctor on standby at the premises at all times. This case brings to mind the dismissive attitude of many Filipinos toward written contracts in business transactions that require the accomplishment of supporting documents. Thus, for example, transactions with banks, insurance companies, and car dealers are accompanied by various kinds of documents that spell out in detail the duties and responsibilities of the parties, including the consequences that may arise in case those terms are not complied with. Because those papers often consist of several pages and are written in legalese or arcane business words that can cause a nosebleed to a layperson, their signatories often hardly read them and simply affix their signatures. They assume that the other party would act in good faith and would not take advantage of the trust they’ve given them. Besides, requesting clarifications or asking questions may not sit well with the counterparty who may want to conclude the transaction as soon as possible and receive his or her commission, if any. Those documents may be described as “contracts of adhesion” or agreements that have been prepared by the party with whom a transaction is being forged and, for obvious reasons, contain fine print that is favorable or advantageous to it. These are often cleverly concealed in “provided, however” clauses or references to other provisions elsewhere in the document that require close reading. Under these circumstances, the party being asked to sign them is put in a “take it or leave it” position, with the chances of making changes or adjustments in their terms practically nil lest they result in unsustainable precedents. Although going through those papers may look tedious or time-consuming, it is prudent that they be read carefully and when some items are unclear, to ask for clarification. There should be no room for shame or embarrassment about requesting explanations, if warranted, because once the document is signed (and in most cases, notarized) it becomes binding on the parties. Belated claims that a party did not understand the meaning of some of the terms and conditions or had misinterpreted the consequences of failure to comply with them will not receive a favorable ear if the contract becomes the subject of litigation. Bear in mind, however, that business transactions cut both ways. That is, they would, if satisfactorily completed, be mutually beneficial as they would serve the interests of the contracting parties, so the right to be enlightened on vague provisions should be exercised. Another flaw in the treatment of documents in business transactions is ignoring or making light of disclosure requirements or provisions that request relevant personal or professional information. Because these data are relevant to the transaction under consideration, it is essential that they are accurate or up to date, otherwise the failure to do so could be cited as legal basis to invalidate any claims that may arise from the subject documents. Going back to the case of the disallowed claim for damages, the high court had no choice but to dismiss it because if the rules were bent for humanitarian reasons, it would create an unfavorable precedent on the principle of sanctity of contracts that businesses feel very strongly about.

        "content": "Bureau of the Treasury MANILA, Philippines — Rates on short-dated securities snapped four straight weeks of decline during Monday’s sale of Treasury bills (T-bills) amid hawkish signals from the US Federal Reserve. Auction results showed the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) was still able to fully raise its target amount of P15 billion via T-bills sale. The offer attracted total demand amounting to P38.3 billion, 2.5 times larger than the original size of the issuance. Michael Ricafort, chief economist at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp., said T-bill rates “corrected slightly higher” after some Fed officials hinted at a delayed rate cut, which may have an influence on the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ own easing moves. “Treasury bill average auction yields corrected slightly higher after slightly declining for four straight weeks, after consistent higher-for-longer signals from most officials and from the Fed minutes recently that reduced the odds of a rate cut,” Ricafort said in a commentary sent to journalists. READ: Less hawkish central bank tempers T-bill rates According to the BTr, the 91-day T-bill fetched an average rate of 5.719 percent, more expensive than 5.712 percent in the previous auction. The yield on the 182-day debt notes stood at 5.886 percent, higher than 5.864 percent previously. The 364-day T-bill fetched a rate of 6.043 percent, up from the previous auction’s 6.007 percent. The Marcos administration plans to borrow P585 billion from local creditors in the second quarter of 2024—the same as the financing program in the first quarter. Under the plan, the government is targeting to raise P195 billion via T-bills and P390 billion via Treasury bonds. Overall, the Department of Finance had announced a bigger borrowing plan for this year at P2.57 trillion—from the old program of P2.46 trillion—as the government raises funds to plug a bigger-than-previously-expected budget hole of P1.5 trillion.

        "content": "A new drama has unfolded amid the “ghost employees” scandal haunting the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). On Monday, Monetary Board (MB) member Benjamin Diokno said he “strongly objects” to the “allegation” that the BSP was “politicized” during his term as central bank governor from 2019 to 2022. He issued a strongly worded statement related to the scandal hounding his two fellow MB members—Bruce Tolentino and Anita Linda Aquino, whose offices allegedly hired ghost employees who may have been on the BSP’s payroll for over a year. READ: BIZ BUZZ: MB seats going vacant soon? Diokno took over the BSP as governor in 2019 when he was appointed by former President Rodrigo Duterte, who also picked Tolentino and Aquino as members of the MB, the highest policy-making body of the BSP. “I’m proud of what I did as BSP governor,” Diokno said, adding that Duterte “has respected the independence of the BSP during the most difficult period in the Philippines’ recent history.” “President Duterte never called me to influence monetary policy. It was never politicized,” an incensed Diokno said. Sources said the BSP wants to recover a “significant” amount of salaries and bonuses paid to the ghost employees, as well as give the MB members tied to the controversy an “orderly exit.” That said, the scandal could potentially trigger a major revamp of the MB at a time the BSP is battling stubbornly high inflation and tackling a volatile peso. And markets are watching how the BSP would come out of this crisis that has brought reputational risks to an institution revered for professionalism. —Ian Nicolas P. Cigaral During the Philippine Economic Briefing in Pasay on Monday, tycoon Ramon S. Ang made his stance clear on the country’s territorial dispute against China in front of top government officials. The chief of San Miguel Corp.—an industry giant with diverse business interests including Petron Corp.—told the country’s economic managers the contested West Philippine Sea would benefit the country in terms of oil production. “We have a very big reserve at the West Philippine Sea. That’s why they’re very interested in the Philippines,” said Ang, who was standing tall and poised in the middle of the Philippine International Convention Center’s reception hall as he delivered his short speech. “Let’s not let go of it. We should claim our territory,” he stressed. A round of applause filled the room after. The Department of Energy estimated in 2021 that the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone has 6.2 billion barrels of oil reserves. — Tyrone Jasper C. Piad The government is eyeing bigger private sector participation in the capital buildup of Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), as the state-run lender moves to beef up its buffers following its hefty contribution to the country’s nascent sovereign wealth fund. The Department of Finance’s (DoF) version of a bill seeking to amend DBP’s 26-year-old charter included a proposal to allow the lender to float 30 percent of its capital stock for public ownership, instead of the 20-percent minimum requirement that corporate regulators currently impose to publicly listed firms. READ: IPO seen to strengthen LandBank, DBP Such a proposal came from the DoF, not from DBP, according to Michael de Jesus, company president and CEO. The bank official said such an amendment would give DBP “more flexibility” in raising capital and “encourage” investments from the private sector. De Jesus said that, at the end of the day, the government would still own more than 67 percent of DBP. ”It’s still a super majority,” he said.

At the heart of the charter amendment is the increase in DBP’s authorized capital stock to P300 billion, from the current P35 billion. The proposed capital hike, in turn, would pave the way for the bank’s stock market debut. — Ian Nicolas P. Cigaral",

        "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Cyberattacks targeting Philippine businesses surged by over threefold last year as threat actors stepped up their game amid increasing digitalization, according to Kaspersky. In a statement on Monday, the Russian cybersecurity firm reported that web-based attacks aimed at local enterprises surged to 1.69 million last year from 492,567 in 2022. Web attacks come in different forms, including the typical phishing emails embedded with suspicious web addresses linking to fake websites. The goal of cyber attackers is to illegally obtain sensitive and personal data they can use to take over one’s bank, e-wallet, and other accounts. Perpetrators have remained active because of financial motivation. With a successful account takeover, they can siphon off money and transfer the amount to their own accounts. Southeast Asia, in total, dealt with more than 13 million cyberattacks last year—about the same amount it fended off in 2022. Kaspersky tracked most of the digital threats in Indonesia with nearly five million attacks, followed by Vietnam with about two million. READ: PH faces more cyberattacks from China-based hackers More than 36,000 online attacks were deployed every day last year in the region, Kaspersky noted. “As most governments in the region build and boost their policies to foster their digital economy and infrastructure, it is urgent for local businesses to prioritize strengthening their cyber defenses against threats lurking online which can hamper their efforts to harness the benefits digitalization brings about,” said Yeo Siang Tiong, Kaspersky general manager for Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, Kaspersky also blocked nearly 300,000 ransomware attacks last year in the region. Most of these were detected in Thailand with 109,315 incidents, followed by Indonesia, with 97,226, and Vietnam with 59,837. The Philippines came next with 15,312 ransomware attacks foiled during the period. READ: PH cyberdefenses building up; attacks down in 2023 Ransomware is a cyberattack whereby hackers hold an entity’s network hostage until a ransom is paid. The disruption in operations caused by such cyberattacks is detrimental to the business due to spending related to the retrieval of their data or system, in addition to opportunity costs because of the downtime.

The person driving the $1 million boat told the Coast Guard over the radio that their vessel 'struck an object in the water and was taking on water,' according to a press release . The radio mayday was made at 11:37 a.m. The Coast Guard coordinated with county authorities and 'nearby good Samaritans' to assist in the rescue. A marine unit from St. John's County Fire and Rescue reached the sinking boat first and got both people out safely. One of the boat's passengers sustained minor injuries and was transported to a hospital, Boat International reported. 'We extend our heartfelt gratitude to St. John's County Fire and Rescue for their invaluable assistance during this case,' said Senior Chief Petty Officer Ricardo Santacana, a Coast Guard Sector Jacksonville command duty officer. The yacht is seen tipping over to its starboard side, or the right side. Rescue boats surround the $1 million vessel Santacana continued: 'With the weather improving and mariners heading out onto the water, it's imperative for everyone to verify the presence of all necessary safety equipment aboard their vessel. 'This ensures that responders, as demonstrated in this case, can swiftly locate you and render assistance when an emergency arises.' Additional photos from rescue teams show that the boat took on water and eventually went vertical before slipping beneath the water. The ship that sank, called 'Atlantis,' and has a top speed of 45 knots, or about 51 miles per hour. The boat is about to go vertical moments before it completely sinks off the coast of St. Augustine Beach The yacht has clear signs of damage as it's about to capsize. The cause of the sinking is still being investigated and the owner will have to arrange salvaging plans for the wreckage It's unclear what 'object' the yacht hit, but there are at least seven reefs off the coast of St. Augustine Beach, where the vessel ultimately sunk. The owner of the capsized vessel will arrange to have it salvaged as authorities investigate what caused the crash.

William and Kate have enjoyed meetings with some of the European royals in recent years, and share a particular warm friendship with King Frederik and . While Kate and Mary are often compared because of their brunette locks and similar sense of style, they also share some of the same interests with their royal work. Queen Mary established her own foundation to improve the lives of vulnerable women and children in 2007, while the Princess of Wales launched the Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood in June 2021, which focuses on the impact of the early years on later life. The two royal ladies joined forces in Denmark in February 2022, when Kate accompanied Mary on a visit to the Danner Crisis Centre, which helps women and children affected by domestic violence. The British royal couple were also reunited with the Danish royals at a Buckingham Palace reception the night before King Charles' coronation. The Prince and Princess of Wales also held a meeting with Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit at Windsor Castle in March 2023, having also carried out a royal tour to Norway in 2018. Kate's first ever solo trip abroad in 2016 saw her fly to the Netherlands, where she met King Willem-Alexander for lunch. The Dutch royals also enjoyed a state visit to the UK during Queen Elizabeth II's reign in 2018. And in 2017, William and Kate joined the Belgian royals at commemorations for the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Passchendaele. The royal family has postponed engagements \"which may appear to divert attention or distract from the election campaign\" after Rishi Sunak called a surprise summer General Election for 4 July. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: \"Following the Prime Minister’s statement this afternoon calling a General Election, the royal family will, in accordance with normal procedure, postpone engagements that may appear to divert attention or distract from the election campaign. Their Majesties send their sincere apologies to any of those who may be affected as a result.\" While the D-Day commemorations on 5 and 6 June and Trooping the Colour on 15 June are expected to go ahead as planned, there is no confirmation as to whether the upcoming Japanese state visit, which was previously postponed due to the pandemic, will still happen in late June.

        "description": "An inside source has claimed Kate is focusing on her mental health.",
        "content": "A royal source has claimed Princess Kate may not be returning to work for the ”rest of the year” as she continues her cancer battle. Speaking to the Daily Beast last week, an insider close to the princess, 42 - who heartbreakingly revealed her cancer battle in March - has claimed the mother of three currently has an “empty” diary for the rest of the year, insinuating she may not return to public facing duties until 2025. “Lots of people involved in planning need to know what all the principals are doing a long way in advance,” the source said. “I am told that Kate’s diary for this year is empty. There is nothing planned. She may not appear in public for the rest of the year.” The insider continued to allege that the princess is largely focused on her mental health and is doing everything she can to avoid any compromising situations, “The key thing for her now is avoiding any kind of stress or anxiety and just getting on with the business of getting better,” they said. Referencing Prince William and the couple’s three children, Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 9 and Prince Louis, 6, the source added, “They will bail out and be off to Sandringham the moment school breaks up.” Elsewhere, Page Six has reported that parents whose children attend the same school as William and Kate’s have not seen the future Queen for months. “There have been rumours she has done drop-off, but I haven’t seen her since the video,” one parent told the outlet. “We all feel very protective of her. Ask anyone at the school — they are amazing parents.” It comes after a source shut down claims that Prince Harry sought to mend his estranged relationship with Kate and William after her cancer diagnosis, insisting any chance of a reunion is “a fantasy”. “Meeting with Harry is the last thing that William or Catherine want or need right now,” the source said. “It’s a fantasy. It’s not about apologies or who said what, it is about protecting his family. Kate is recovering from cancer, and they are avoiding stressful situations.” They continued to claim if the Sussexes believe they will “descend on Balmoral this summer” it would be “wishful thinking”. “It’s all just very sad,” the source said. Rumours first began swirling about the alleged phone call when royal expert, Tom Quinn claimed, “Since leaving the UK, Harry has actually contacted at least one royal: Kate.” He added, “She is sympathetic, but fully supports her husband and, struggling with her own health problems, has no intention of playing peacemaker.” Kate announced in March she was undergoing treatment after doctors detected cancer in her body following her major abdominal surgery in January in The London Clinic. She said in the short video: “In January, I underwent major abdominal surgery in London and at the time, it was thought that my condition was non-cancerous. The surgery was successful, however, tests after the operation found cancer had been present. “My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventive chemotherapy and I’m now in the early stages of that treatment.” The princess solemnly confessed the news had come as a “huge shock” and continued to praise her husband for his support during “an incredibly tough couple of months for our entire family”.

        "content": "A bakery that was hit with nearly 20 infractions earlier this year has been shut down by Toronto health inspectors. New King of Kings Bakery, which received 18 infractions in March but remained open after receiving a conditional pass, is closed until further notice. The bakery, which offers fresh baked goods and boasts a hot table with everything from turkey to fried fish, had previously passed with no or minor infractions prior to March’s inspection. However, New King of Kings, located at 248 Eddystone Ave. in North York, was forced to shut down after health inspectors issued it a summons and health hazard order on Friday, according to Toronto Public Health . The first of two new crucial violations pertained to the food premises being maintained in a manner permitting a health hazard, specifically insects. The other crucial infraction was that the establishment was “maintained in a manner permitting adverse effect on food,” but the bakery received a “notice to comply” action for the issue. The bakery received five additional infractions — four significant and one minor. The four significant violations were that it failed to protect against the breeding of pests, used food equipment not of readily cleanable form, did not maintain hand-washing stations with soap and paper towels and did not provide an adequate number of hand-washing stations. The one minor infraction was that its equipment surfaces were not sanitized as necessary. A detailed list of infractions at Toronto restaurants can be found on DineSafe .",

Eamonn spoke about his desire to return to Belfast last year, revealing how his wife was always 'very irritated' when he called it home. He said last year, when asked where he thinks of as home: 'Well, it's not Surrey. When people ask me what I'm doing at the weekend, I tell them I'm going home.

        "content": "Questioning the Centre’s position on China, Congress candidate Shashi Tharoor on Monday said the Bharatiya Janata Party’s position on Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) is only an “election tactics” adding that it must also focus on what is happening on the Chinese borders. Union Home Minister Amit Shah recently made a statement that PoK is a part of India and it will be taken back once BJP retains power. Reacting to this, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said, “These are all election tactics. Those who talk about PoK, don’t think about what impact it will have internationally. What they have done about China? On 65 patrolling points, the agreement was going well in the last 45 years. But, now at 26 points, the Chinese military is there and our Jawans can’t go, when they tried, 20 of our Jawans were killed. The government is in no position to talk about this and they are talking about the PoK. It’s nonsensical to talk such things.” On Amit Shah claiming that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has crossed 310 marks in the five phases of the ongoing Lok Sabha elections, Tharoor said, “Whatever Amit Shah says about the number of seats, we should discount it by 30-40 per cent, then we will see the reality. I think it’s (NDA to cross 400) not going to happen, BJP is in a bad state and the time has come for a change in the government”. Regarding the potential Prime Ministerial candidate for the INDIA alliance, if it comes to power, Tharoor remarked that the decision would involve consultation among the 26 parties. “Twenty-six parties collectively ponder over this matter. With so many leaders among them, there shouldn’t be much concern. After all, it’s not a Presidential system. Prime Minister Modi seems to be operating the parliamentary system as if it were a Presidential one. In a Presidential system, everyone casts their vote for a single individual.In a parliamentary system, we consider the party, various candidates, and then select a leader. In the 2004 elections, who could have predicted that Manmohan Singh would emerge as the leader?” Tharoor said. (ANI)",

        "content": "Yomi Faparusi, a Nigerian-American based in Tennessee, in the United States, is vying as an independent candidate to represent Tennessee District 5 in the US Congress. The election is slated for November 5, 2024. Faparusi, who made this known while speaking during a virtual meeting with reporters at the weekend, said his victory in November 5, 2024 election would inspire the next generation. He said there is hyper-inflation in the country, making it hard for the generality of the people to survive. He added that the middle class is disappearing, and that the American dream was threatened. Faparusi, who is a researcher, said he is contesting because America is divided and weakened, and that he was running to unite Americans across various divides. “America is so divided and weakened because politicians now run on divisive and wedge issues. Hence, I decided to run as a unifier, so that things can get done. I also hope my victory in November would inspire the next generation. “There is inflation making it hard to make ends meet; the middle class is disappearing, and the American dream is threatened. I want to tackle inflation. I want to create an environment that is conducive to small businesses, the most important units of job creation. “Congress is in stalemate, and nothing is getting done. I will work across the aisle for the common good. Americans are tired of cyclical threats of government shutdowns. “Immigration is in total disarray. Open borders are not a policy; it only makes it hard to have a comprehensive plan. Immigration is not only a social issue; it is a financial/economic issue: you don’t have papers; you can’t get a job. “The reality is that most legislators would not entertain any immigration relief package unless the border is secure. Hence, we need to secure the border and get back with a bipartisan comprehensive immigration plan. “I am running as an Independent because I do not want to be beholden to any party. I still have a political ideology. There is something called an advantage of incumbency, but incumbents lose, as I hope in November. The TN 5th district is ideologically diverse, and it needs to be represented by someone who understands and appreciates this diversity. I will represent all the people and not just a partisan segment. “I am a business owner and I know about job creation. Also, I have had to work with diverse stakeholders hence I learnt how to listen and be humble. These have allowed me to be a good negotiator in any forum. “As an immigrant and now an immigration attorney, I know the practicalities of immigration. “As simplistic as it seems, the theme of my agenda is ‘I care’. I care about your concerns, and I want to go to Washington to serve you. I hope that you will give me a chance to represent you and I will always be answerable to you, my constituents. I will advocate for your concerns and needs without fear of retribution because I have placed the people above party. At the end, everything will be okay.” Faparusi was born at the University of Ibadan, Oyo State, while his ancestral hometown is Ode-Ekiti, Gbonyin LGA of Ekiti State. He graduated as a medical doctor from the College of Medicine, University of Ibadan. He was into students’ union politics, where he served as the Hall Chairman of Alexander Brown Hall, while he was in school. He is a licensed physician (medical doctor) and a licensed attorney (Lawyer) based in Tennessee. He has a law practice where he focuses mostly on immigration law. Faparusi, who was involved in the agitation against military rule during the Abacha regime in Nigeria, fled Nigeria to escape being persecuted by the tyrannical military regime.",

Jones would drive Brooks to appointments for treatment on stage-two Hodgkin lymphoma and would sit with him following chemotherapy sessions, with Brooks later receiving the all-clear and returning to the pitch after 500 days in March last year. The pair are never far away from each other and got engaged last year as Brooks proposed to Jones in a luxury setting in the Indian Ocean island nation of Mauritius.

Rebekah Vardy - Jamie Vardy's wife (Leicester) Read More Rebekah Vardy says she no longer cares about Wagatha Christie trial and insists she 'knows the truth' after losing high court battle with Coleen Rooney Perhaps one of the most famous partners of a player in English football, in large part due to her involvement in the Wagatha Christie scandal back in 2022. Coleen Rooney's accusations that the wife of Leicester City star Jamie, was leaking posts from her private Instagram account to The Sun and the line 'It's Rebekah Vardy's account - sparked a media storm between the pair. Vardy sued Rooney for libel and the case came to a halt in May 2022 when the court dismissed her claim insisting that the statements by the wife of Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney were substantially true. She was left with a £3m court fee, but back in December she said she no longer cares about the trial and 'knows the truth'. Vardy is perhaps best famed for the Wagatha Christie saga which Coleen Rooney accused her of leaking messages to the Sun Despite losing her court case, Vardy said she no longer cares about the Wagatha Christie saga Vardy wrote: 'I certainly didn't expect what became known as the 'Wagatha Christie' trial. If you care, you'll know the details. If you don't, I'll spare you: thinking about it is a total waste of time and energy. All I'll say is that I know the truth, as do many others.' Rebekah has five children, three of which are fathered by Jamie, who also another child from a prior relationship. Former Premier League title winner, Jamie, is now 37, and approaching the end of his football career. However, he is still ruthless in front of goal and scored 20 goals in all competitions -- including 18 in the Championship - as he prepares to take to the top flight one more time. Before Leicester's relegation last season, he had scored 136 goals in 307 games - putting him 15th on the list of all-time top scorers since the Premier League's inception. Rebekah and Jamie have three children together, as well as both having children from prior relationships Suwilanji Mpondela - Patson Daka's wife (Leicester) Another Foxes striker returning to the Premier League is Patson Daka, who is married to Zambian sprinter Suwilanji Mpondela. They are one of the most famous celebrity couples in Zambia, with Daka set to return to the top flight of English football, and Mpondela a 100m sprinter. She computed at the U20 World Championships back in 2018, and in 2021 she along with her 4x100m relay team-mates set a new national record with a time of 43.85 seconds. In 2019, she was voted in as the inaugural chairperson for the National Olympic Committee of Zambia - making her Africa's youngest elected Athletes Commission Chair at the age of 19.

Speaking to CBS Sports , Hermansen said his absorption of other sports have helped him in his role as a goalkeeper. One of which is ice hockey - a sport that his girlfriend Sofie Rosenkilde competed in. He said from ice hockey it has improved his one-on-one blocking, positioning, and using defenders to screen the goalkeeper. Rosenkilde regularly shares updates of her life on Instagram to her more than 4,000 followers. She recently supported him at the EFL awards where he was named in the Championship Team of the Season. In a message on Instagram she wrote that she was 'beyond proud' of the 23-year-old Danish goalkeeper.

        "content": "Despite an alert issued from the administration and India Meteorological Department (IMD), fishermen were seen fishing in the Mohana near Digha area in West Bengal’s East Medinipur district on Monday in the wake of the landfall of Cyclone ‘Remal’. The IMD has issued an alert message and warned the fishermen not to venture into North Bay of Bengal along and off West Bengal and Bangladesh coasts on May 27. On the other hand, a large number of tourists visited Digha beach on Monday. The Cyclonic Storm “Remal” (pronounced as “Re-Mal”) over Coastal Bangladesh and adjoining Coastal West Bengal moved nearly northwards, with a speed of 15 kmph during past 06 hours and lay centered at 0830 hrs IST of today, the 27th May, 2024 over the same region, near latitude 22.8°N and longitude 89.3°E about 40 km northwest of Mongla (Bangladesh), 90 km east of Kolkata (West Bengal), 90 km northeast of Canning (West Bengal), 130 km northwest of Khepupara (Bangladesh) and 140 km southwest of Dhaka (Bangladesh). West Bengal Power Secretary Santanu Basu said, “South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas, Howrah, Hoogly, parts of Medinipur, Murshidabad, and Nadia districts have been affected by cyclone Remal the most. We started our restoration work early in the morning today...” “We have been able to restore 45 out of the 50 substations that were affected and 80% of the restoration work, be it in the substation level or in the downstream infrastructure with respect to the 33kV feeders or the 11 kV feeders has been restored. In certain areas in the North 24 Parganas, we have been unable to restore 6-7 substations because of the wind and rain... In South 24 Parganas we have been able to restore almost all the substations... We have engagements of additional gangs from the nearby districts which have moved to North and South 24 Parganas to help in fastening up the restoration,” he said. The Cyclone is likely to move north-northeastwards, and gradually weaken further into a Deep Depression by night of Monday. “The severe cyclonic storm ‘Remal’ has weakened since making landfall last night and is expected to downgrade into a deep depression by this evening,” the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) announced on Monday. The NDRF made the announcement based on the latest update from the India Meteorological Department (IMD). “The current information that we have from the IMD is that the severe cyclonic storm has now transformed into a cyclonic storm. The wind speed, which was earlier about 110 to 120 km/hr during landfall, now has come down to 60 to 70 km/hr,” NDRF Deputy Inspector General Mohsen Shahedi told ANI when asked about the status of ‘Remal’ after its landfall. Pointing out the downfall in the intensity of the cyclone, Shahedi said “This is a big relief and it is expected that by evening today, this will further change into a deep depression.” (ANI)",

        "content": "The Alaska House of Representatives chamber, photographed on Monday, Jan. 16, 2023 at the Alaska State Capitol in Juneau. (Loren Holmes / ADN) With days remaining before the filing deadline for Alaska’s legislative candidates, more than a third of the state’s 40 House members are poised to run for reelection unopposed. Candidates have until June 1 to formally declare their intent to run with the Alaska Division of Elections. Some candidates wait until the last minute to file their paperwork. But in large swaths of the state, lawmakers could keep their seats with little or no competition. The 2022 election led to the largest freshman class of lawmakers in two decades, with 20 out of 60 lawmakers new to the Alaska Legislature. The change was brought about in part by a one-a-decade redistricting process that put multiple incumbents in the same districts, and allowed newcomers to run outside the shadow of longtime politicians. But 2024 is set to bring far less turnover. In the Senate, every incumbent up for reelection has indicated an intention to run again. In the House, only three lawmakers have indicated they don’t plan to attempt to keep their seats — creating limiting possibilities for open races. Rep. Jennie Armstrong, D-Anchorage, whose Alaska residency was challenged during the 2022 election cycle, is not running again. Democrat Carolyn Hall is currently the only candidate registered to run for the seat. Rep. Laddie Shaw, R-Anchorage, is retiring this year at the age of 75. Multiple candidates have indicated they could run for the seat, including Girdwood Republican Lee Ellis, a craft brewery president, and Ky Holland, a nonpartisan candidate and entrepreneur. Rep. Ben Carpenter, R-Nikiski, is not seeking reelection to his House seat, instead running for a Senate seat against incumbent Sen. Jesse Bjorkman. The two Republicans differ on key issues, including education funding. Bjorkman voted to override Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s veto of a bill that would have permanently increased education spending, while Carpenter voted to sustain Dunleavy’s veto. Two Republicans have registered to run for Carpenter’s seat — Ben Elam and John Hillyer, both of Soldotna. Elam is a member of the Kenai Peninsula Borough Assembly. Hillyer is a retired Air Force general and pilot. Rep. Jesse Sumner, R-Wasilla, said Thursday that he was still undecided on whether he would run again, after winning the open seat in 2022 a four-way Republican race. He said he was weighing several factors, including his family and his business, and would likely decide whether to run close to the June 1 deadline. Where incumbents do face challengers, several races promise repeats of 2022 match-ups. Rep. Tom McKay, R-Anchorage, will again face Democrat Denny Wells. In 2022, McKay beat Wells in a ranked choice tabulation by seven votes, and the race is again expected to be very tight this year. Rep. Stanley Wright, R-Anchorage, has indicated he plans to run again. So has Democrat Ted Eischeid, who in 2022 lost to Wright by 72 votes. Rep. Dan Ortiz, I-Ketchikan, is again facing Republican challenger Jeremy Bynum. In 2022, Ortiz beat Bynum by 343 votes. Rep. Julie Coulombe, R-Anchorage, will again face nonpartisan candidate Walter Featherly. In 2022, Featherly received over 45% of the vote but was bested by Coulombe in a ranked choice tabulation , after third-place Republican finisher Ross Bieling was eliminated. Rep. Cliff Groh, D-Anchorage, will face Republican David Nelson. Groh bested Nelson in 2022, when Nelson garnered 44% of votes in the district. Rep. Neal Foster, D-Nome, will face Tyler Ivanoff, a member of the Alaska Independence Party from Shishmaref. In 2022, Foster beat Ivanoff by 92 votes. Sen. James Kaufman, R-Anchorage, will face Democrat Janice Park, who lost to Kaufman by more than 1,300 votes in 2022. Sen. Kelly Merrick, R-Eagle River, is set to again face Republican Ken McCarty, along with two other Republican challengers. McCarty, a former House member, ran to the right of Merrick in 2022, and lost to her by more than 2,400 votes. At stake for challengers hoping to unseat incumbents is control of the Alaska House and Senate. The Senate is governed by a 17-member bipartisan coalition that is likely — though not guaranteed — to survive the coming election. But in the House, Republicans narrowly gained control of the chamber in 2023 thanks to support from four non-Republican members of the Bush Caucus, which represents rural districts. Control of the chamber could easily flip, many say, if one or more seats currently held by Republicans are won by Democrats or nonpartisan candidates. A single seat can make a difference in control of the Legislature and in the outcome of key legislation, as lawmakers learned earlier this year, when they failed by a single vote to override Dunleavy’s veto of the education bill. In District 6, incumbent Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer, faces multiple challengers — including nonpartisan candidate Brent Johnson, who is currently the Kenai Peninsula Borough Assembly president. Announcing his legislative bid earlier this month, Johnson cited Vance’s decision not to override the governor’s veto of the education bill, which was broadly supported by public school educators across the state. The announcement foreshadows what lawmakers have discussed behind closed doors ever since Dunleavy vetoed Senate Bill 140 earlier this year: that opposition to veto override vote would come back to haunt some Republican incumbents in their reelection bids. Johnson said in an interview last week that he had first considered running for the Legislature more than a decade ago. But he enjoyed working on his local borough assembly and living in his Clam Gulch home. “I didn’t want to change any of that. And I held that position consistent, even though people asked me to run several times, until the failure to override the governor’s veto of education funding,” Johnson said. Vance is a conservative member of the current Republican-dominated majority, and a key backer of Dunleavy’s policies. Johnson said that if elected, he would look to join a bipartisan caucus, and to rebuke some of Dunleavy’s policies, including in the areas of education and fishery management. The Kenai Peninsula is not the only place where the veto override vote has motivated some challengers to enter a race. In District 40, which includes the North Slope and Northwest Alaska, Robyn Burke, an Utqiagvik Democrat, said she decided to run for the state House after Rep. Thomas Baker, R-Kotzebue, became one of several Republicans who initially voted in favor of the education legislation but later voted to sustain Dunleavy’s veto. “Baker’s vote virtually assured deep education cuts that make it improbable to adequately staff our schools or provide basic materials,” Burke, the North Slope Borough School District board president, wrote in an op-ed that appeared in the Daily News. Burke is one of two challengers who have so far indicated they plan to run against Baker, along with Kotzebue city mayor Saima Chase. Baker was appointed to the seat by Dunleavy after former Rep. Josiah Patkotak was elected North Slope Borough Mayor last year. Baker had not yet filed to run for the seat as of Thursday and did not respond to a message asking if he intended to. Earlier this month, Baker announced on social media that he would change his party affiliation from Republican to undeclared “to more effectively address the specific needs” of his constituents. The primary election is set to take place on Aug. 20. Under Alaska’s election system, the top-four vote getters in every legislative race, regardless of political party, advance to the general election.",

He used his platform to remind people how precious life is and to . “I would challenge everybody here, and I’m going to do this myself as well each day, say something nice to someone you love and also make a point to say something nice to someone you do not even know,” Higgs said. \"Everyone here could be a difference. The difference.\" honored Grayson Murray in his speech after winning . That challenge was just a piece of the statement Higgs sent. It was a moment in time that made someone stand still and listen. He did not have to go that route but chose to. “We lost, yesterday morning, one of our own,” Higgs said. “I don’t know if you guys heard the news, but somebody who went through a lot of difficult things, somebody that was open and honest about it... I thought about this moment and how to maybe remember Grayson. This golf stuff and the result, it’s lovely, sure, but it’s not that meaningful.” Higgs acknowledges that while he does not suffer from mental battles, he recognizes those that do. The 32-year-old has not played his best in recent years. He had to go back and play Q-school last year. The former SMU golfer knows how challenging this sport is and how hard this world makes things for people. “Lord knows how many people do, and it’s only ever increasing, so if we can — Everybody here could make a difference. The difference,” Higgs said. “Brighten up somebody’s day — it could mean the world.” After the trophy ceremony, Higgs continued to explain why he made the tribute to Murray. As a professional golfer, he knows all too well how terrible people can be on and off the internet. Higgs is one of the most humble individuals. He usually keeps things light and fun. The Dallas resident claims he is not the influential type, but his words suggest otherwise. “It’s OK to not be OK — to reach out,” he said. “The world’s tough, man. Social media is awesome but also a pain in the you-know-what. People can be mean. I’m mean sometimes, too. I’m certainly not perfect, but I’m going to certainly try to live what I said.” “That will be part of my routine, part of the things that I can control outside the golf course and hopefully bring light to somebody that may be having a hard time. Hopefully, make a difference in a few people’s lives over the course of however many years I have left on this crazy planet.”",

        "description": "Antiques Roadshow expert Ken Farmer was left stunned when a guest brought in a large portrait of her fifth great-grand uncle - a sea captain who was believed to be the 'youngest sea captain in the New England area'",
        "content": "An Antiques Roadshow guest shared a chilling tale about her family's \"haunted\" painting. Expert Ken Farmer was presented with a grand portrait of Aaron Delano, the fifth great-grand uncle of the elderly guest. The woman explained that the painting had been passed down through generations, from her grandmother to her parents and then to her. She said: \"We believe that he is, through both research and word of mouth, that he was the youngest sea captain in the New England area. He was born in 1767 and unfortunately, he passed away, lost at sea in 1794.\" She further detailed that during his lifetime, it was believed Delano was trading along the New England coast, journeying from Plymouth and Nantucket to somewhere in Nova Scotia. Then, the guest revealed the eerie side of the painting. \"Over the years, we have decided as a family that he's probably haunted\", she confessed. \"When I was a teenager in my home, when my parents got him, they'd hang him in the front stairway and I would swear that I could hear him open and close the front door, walk up the stairs and walk down the hall. 13 Best wedding guest dresses for summer 2024 under £100 from River Island, Mango, M&S and more Antiques Roadshow guest's tragic story of ‘haunted’ portrait worth a fortune ( Image: PBR) \"And I would think that it was my father or my mother coming home and I'd go out and there was no one there. My older sister also experienced the walking sound in the hallway. When I was taking the picture down to bring it here, my husband was helping me.\" He was on the ladder and all of a sudden, the ladder slipped and went: 'Oh! First thing he said was: 'Oh Aaron'\". Antiques Roadshow expert Ken Farmer had some interesting observations: \"It's as much an illustration of his occupation as anything else. But he's very handsome, he's young. I love his face and the way that's painted and I love the patterned cloth on his vest. There, he's using the tools of his trade. That looks like a map and that instrument is an octant which means that it would do an eighth of a circle.\" He noted that it was a bit unique for an oil painting to be behind glass but was certain that she had \"something that's very extraordinary in terms of what appeals to people who collect Americana and folk art\". Farmer went on: \"We don't know who the artist is, because lots of times, these artists were itinerant, and we don't know who a lot of them were. Just in the condition that it's in right now, it's got paint loss, if you look right here, I think there's actually some film on the glass. But most importantly, there's no loss in his face or in the instruments, and the detail of the painting that I think really makes it valuable. And so after much conversation at the folk art table, we feel like at an auction, in as-is condition, its value would be £7,000 to £8,000.\" Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .",

        "description": "An international meta study reveals that there may be less of certain mold toxins in organically grown grain, compared to grain grown in the conventional manner. This, and other findings from research into agricultural products, can have major consequences.",
        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread by Anne Wennberg, University of Oslo An international meta study reveals that there may be less of certain mold toxins in organically grown grain, compared to grain grown in the conventional manner. This, and other findings from research into agricultural products, can have major consequences. \"Up until now, the general assumption has been that grain grown using organic methods is more contaminated with mold toxins than grain grown in the conventional way and contaminated grain can pose a health risk to humans. \"An extensive meta analysis published in Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety , demonstrates the opposite,\" says professor Per Ole Iversen. He is one of two scientists from the Department of Nutrition at UiO who participated in the study. Carlo Leifert, professor of organic agriculture and currently a guest professor at the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, also both initiated and participated in the study. Iversen is the representative of human medicine in the research group and believes that the study is greatly strengthened by being interdisciplinary. \"The meta study we have just published makes it clear that organic methods of cultivation do not lead to a higher incidence of mold in crops than conventionally grown grain, and to some extent, the opposite is the case: for two types of mold, there was no difference.\" In addition, the study has also revealed a number of advantages linked to organic cultivation. \"Research into organically grown foods has been carried out for many years and many people believe that this type of cultivation is good for both livestock and farmers—and for human health—but we were not quite sure about the latter. \"Now it looks as if organically grown fruit and vegetables have a more favorable content of antioxidants and micronutrients than agricultural products produced in the conventional way, and this can be good for both you and me,\" says Iversen. Iversen believes that the study will have major consequences. \"The myth that organic cultivation has a higher risk of being affected by mold has now been largely refuted. In any case, it should not weaken the message that organic food production is to be recommended,\" says Iversen, adding that these findings are very surprising and have weight, since they are based on a large number of well documented findings from different parts of the world. Iversen and his colleagues have previously conducted a randomized, clinical study among university students , where they also found that organically grown food is advantageous compared to agricultural products cultivated in the normal way. \"We are currently carrying out a new randomized study, which examines two groups of pregnant women : one group is eating organic food while the other is eating ordinary food during pregnancy. We will then carry out a thorough study of the effect of the organic food intake on both mothers and babies for two years following each baby's birth,\" he explains. Per Ole Iversen played two roles in the extensive meta study. \"I participated in the selection of the studies to be included. In addition, I contributed with reflections from a doctor's point of view on what kind of consequences the study could have for the health of ordinary people.\" More information: Juan Wang et al, Mycotoxin contamination in organic and conventional cereal grain and products: A systematic literature review and meta‐analysis, Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety (2024).

The Project is being implemented currently in the following Niger-Delta States of Abia, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo and Ondo. The State Project Coordinator, Mr John Omoruyi who made the disclosure in a statement on Monday in Benin, said the ₦147 million payment covered 2022, 2023 and 2024 counterpart funds. Omoruyi said the payment cover three years counterpart fund for the project meant to create wealth, sustainable job, and ensure food security in the participating states. Omoruyi said” the governor has been commended by the National Project Coordinator (NPC), LIFE-ND, Engr Sanni Abiodun for the prompt payment. “This is in line with the consistent desire of the federal and state governments of Nigeria and IFAD, to attain sustainable job and wealth creation as well as ensure food security in Nigeria,” he stated. He stated that Obaseki was the first governor in the country to pay its counterpart fund up to date. According to the statement, Abiodun urged other participating States to emulate Edo state Governor in this regard. Omoruyi also said that the payment of N147 million counterpart funds to LIFE-ND would enable the state access funds for the ongoing transformation of rural economy via agribusiness. “Gov. Obaseki has done well to restate his commitment to sustainable development of the agricultural sector by promoting modern farming techniques, supporting smallholders farmers, encouraging value addition and fostering agribusiness innovations. “Furthermore, this feat by the Obaseki administration will not only contribute to economic growth but also enhace food security, reduce poverty and empower rural communities in Edo State. “This is in addition to boosting agricultural productivity and value addition across four commodities’ rice, cassava, poultry and Fishery value chains,” he said. According to Omoruyi, LIFE-ND as of today in Edo State, has created jobs for 2,348 women and youth enterprises out of the targeted 4,250 across the participating ten local government areas and 100 communities across the State. He said the release of this counterpart fund by the Governor, will further create employment for over 2,500 women and youths targeted for year 2024.",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ‘Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.”",

After belting out lyrics at the crowded venue, she received a standing ovation from the audience. However, some social media users on X (formerly known as Twitter ) shared their thoughts on Kim and Kanye's daughter snagging a coveted role in the musical concert.

North's acting debut came after she announced her first album Elementary School Dropout in March, a nod to her dad's 2004 debut The College Dropout. The preteen was also featured on 'Talking / Once Again', from Vultures 1, Ye's collaborative album with Ty Dolla $ign.

        "content": "Kieran McKenna is set to stay at Ipswich and sign a new long-term contract after attracting interest from Manchester United, Chelsea and Brighton. The 38-year-old coach has guided Ipswich to back-to-back EFL promotions and a first Premier League campaign at Portman Road for 22 years, but there were question marks over whether he would remain at the club next season. Sky Sports News revealed McKenna was a candidate for the vacant Brighton job following Roberto De Zerbi's departure, while Man Utd officials met with representatives of the Ipswich boss . McKenna was also linked with replacing Mauricio Pochettino at Chelsea, but was told by phone on Sunday that the club were looking elsewhere. Sky Sports News also learned that Ipswich Town majority shareholder Ed Schwartz flew into the UK from the United States at the end of last week for talks with the club's chief executive officer Mark Ashton and McKenna.

The 38-year-old coach has guided Ipswich to back-to-back EFL promotions and a first Premier League campaign at Portman Road for 22 years, but there were question marks over whether he would remain at the club next season. Sky Sports News revealed McKenna was a candidate for the vacant Brighton job following Roberto De Zerbi's departure, while Man Utd officials met with representatives of the Ipswich boss . McKenna was also linked with replacing Mauricio Pochettino at Chelsea, but was told by phone on Sunday that the club were looking elsewhere.

        "content": "B.C. Place is going to turn into “Da Club” with U.S. rapper 50 Cent set to perform at a pre-game concert at the B.C. Lions’ home opener. The team announced Monday that 50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, will headline the Lions’ third annual concert kickoff on June 15 before its first home game of the season against the Calgary Stampeders. “It’s an honour to give our great fans the opportunity to see a world class performer who resonates across multiple generations of music lovers,” said Lions’ owner Amar Doman in a statement. “Concert Kickoff has become a great tradition in Vancouver and 50 Cent is our best one yet.” The Grammy- and Juno-award winning artist skyrocketed to fame in 2003 with his debut album Get Rich or Die Tryin’ and its massive hit In Da Club. The rapper was a guest performer in Super Bowl LVI halftime show in 2022 in Los Angeles, performing with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar in what was the first Super Bowl halftime show to feature entirely hip-hop music. The artist performed in Vancouver last year at a sold-out show at Rogers Arena as part of his Final Lap tour.

Place at 3 p.m. on June 15 before kickoff at 4 p.m. There will also be a backyard party at 10:30 a.m. with games, food and drinks, including $5 beers, at Terry Fox Plaza. It will be the Lions’ first game at their home arena, but their second game of the season. The team start their first game on the road against the Toronto Argonauts on June 9. Tickets for the concert kickoff start at $25 for adults and $17 for 17 and under. This is the third time the B.C. Lions are kicking off their season with a celebrity performer. Last year, LL Cool J drew large crowds to B.C. Place , while pop group OneRepublic kicked off the pre-game concert series in 2022, drawing more than 34,000 to the game, the largest crowd of the regular season for the CFL. chchan@postmedia.com",

        "description": "Over 130 people died at a single hospital in Sudan's besieged city of El Fasher, inDarfur region, according to Médecins Sans Frontières",
        "content": "Fighting between rival groups in Sudan’s civil war in the battle for control of the city has recently intensified. El Fasher is the last major urban centre in Darfur that remains in the hands of Sudan’s army. The army has been fighting the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for more than a year, in a civil war that has killed thousands and forced millions from their homes. The army remains in control of El Fasher. The city has become a refuge for people displaced by fighting in other areas. On 10 May the RSF intensified their assault on the city, in what UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called “an alarming new chapter” in Sudan’s conflict. MSF said one of its hospital was struggling to cope with the increased casualties. South Hospital had treated 979 casualties in just over two weeks, the charity said on Sunday. 134 had died, “a sign of the violent intensity of the fighting”, it added. The medical director of El Fasher’s government-run Saudi hospital told the BBC the situation was “terrible”. “Since the early morning, the RSF began violent artillery shelling of the city, targeting residential areas, markets, and hospitals,” Modther Ibrahim Suliman said. The Saudi and South hospitals are the last functioning in the region. The Saudi Hospital was previously shuttered by the violence but it partially reopened to treat emergency cases. Supplies at the hospital are running low and will last barely a week, the UN said. MSF said it treated more than 900 casualties in the past two weeks. El Fasher residents say that access to food and water has become increasingly difficult. The RSF has been attacking the city from three sides and blocked all supply routes. Despite the hardships, many residents in the city are not leaving their homes because of the fighting, even for emergency medical care. Journalist Mohamed Zakaria said he had no plans to flee. “There is no place to go to... the road is very difficult and dangerous right now”. Earlier this week, a UN expert warned civilians in El Fasher were being targeted because of their ethnicity. Special adviser Alice Wairimu Nderitu added that the Darfur region as a whole was facing a growing risk of genocide as the world’s attention remained focused on conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. War erupted in the East African nation on April 15 last year, when the RSF militia and Sudan’s army turned on each other. That followed months of talks over merging their forces and transitioning the mineral-rich country toward democracy. The fighting has killed almost 15,000 people and left half of the population of 50 million in need of food assistance. Some 11 million are displaced internally, and the capital, Khartoum, lies in ruins. The UAE is a key backer of the RSF, supplying it with weapons and funding, according to a report by United Nations investigators seen by Bloomberg in January. The US is engaged in talks with Emirati officials about their role in the war, while the UK has initiated discussions on Sudan at the UN Security Council in New York. Those moves have irked officials from the UAE. Last month, UK Deputy Foreign Secretary Andrew Mitchell told Channel 4 News that his boss, David Cameron, had raised the issue directly with the UAE. “They must not allow arms to get into this conflict — because if they do it will damage them, as well as everyone else. So it’s a message which Britain is putting very forcefully,” Mitchell said. The UAE affirmed its “categorical rejection” of the allegations in a statement on Tuesday, saying the country was engaging with the US and others to work for a settlement. “This dissemination of disinformation and false narratives by a warring side of the conflict after more than a year of this crisis aims to only deflect responsibility and undermine international efforts to address the humanitarian crisis in Sudan,” the UAE said. At least 134 people have been killed in the past two weeks as a result of recent escalations in the ongoing conflict between Sudan’s military and paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Doctors without Borders reported Sunday. Doctors without Borders, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), said, “We have now treated 979 casualties since the fighting began over two weeks ago, and the death toll has reached 134 – a sign of the violent intensity of the fighting.” The loss of life is a result of escalated conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces and Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group aided by Arab militias known as Janjaweed. The conflict began in April 2023, when tensions between the two groups boiled over in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. Over a year later, the fighting has anchored itself in el-Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur and the military’s final stronghold. The abhorrent humanitarian crisis that grips Sudan continues to leave a pathway of displacement and loss of life in its wake. USA executive director Avril Benoît says, “Our medical teams on the ground are providing emergency medical treatment, carrying out trauma surgery and caesarean sections, and running mobile clinics for displaced people”. Benoît warns of a looming famine and alarming backdrop of malnutrition, as well as the intensification of ethnic violence as the conflict wears on. Per Benoît, “What has been a collection of localised humanitarian crises has quickly evolved into an all-consuming humanitarian catastrophe”. Last month, the UN Security Council issued a press statement urging the Sudanese Armed Forces and RSF to de-escalate the conflict, seek a sustainable ceasefire and comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law. The Security Council has also called on all Member States to refrain from external interference, which could threaten instability. Member States must adhere to the arms embargo measures in Resolution 1556 (2005). The resolution obliges states to prevent the sale or supply of arms to the Janjaweed operating in North, South, and West Darfur. Doctors without Borders is an international aid organisation whose mission is to offer medical humanitarian assistance to those in war-torn, disease-stricken areas. On May 25, the group reported the loss of a staff member who was tragically killed when shelling hit his home in Sudan; “[m]any of our staff lost family members or their homes during the shelling as well”. As the fighting continues, the shortage of medical staff and the urgent need for medical supplies become ever-apparent. The warning of Claire Nicolet, head of emergency programs, rings clear: Medical supplies are running out—we have only around 10 days of supplies left, so we urgently need to be able to restock the hospital. We need safe access and authorizations from the warring parties to be able to do this. If we don’t get these supplies, it will be extremely difficult to continue to treat the wounded.",

        "content": "( ) – Mike Tyson suffered a medical emergency on a flight headed to Los Angeles from Miami on Sunday night. “Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great,” Tyson’s representatives said. “He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare-up 30 minutes before landing. He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.” Reports that the flight was delayed due to the emergency are inaccurate, Tyson’s reps said. The flight took off two hours later than scheduled. “It’s false reporting that his medical attention caused the flight delay,” his team stated. “This two-hour delay was due to an air conditioning issue on the aircraft.” According to , the flight was also delayed 25 minutes once it landed at LAX as paramedics boarded the aircraft to tend to Tyson. This comes a little under two months before Tyson, 57, is set to return to the ring after almost 20 years. On July 20, about a month after his 58th birthday, he’ll take on 27-year-old Jake Paul in a boxing match at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The fight will be streamed live on Netflix.",

        "description": "MMA icon Anderson Silva is getting back in the ring one last time, and he’s in peak shape to face his greatest rival. The legendary...",
        "content": "The legendary former champion is having his final fight in his home nation of Brazil, and bringing along for a long-awaited trilogy. The pair will compete on June 15 at a catchweight of 216lb, with the American making his boxing debut in the five-round exhibition. Sonnen has promised to arrive in terrific shape, but hasn’t fought since retiring on a two-fight skid in 2019. Meanwhile, Silva spent the three years between 2020 and 2023 fairly active before taking a two-year break from competition when he lost to . Anderson Silva’s coach reveals impressive shape ahead of Chael Sonnen fight The legendary duo are 49 and 47 respectively, and will only compete for two minute rounds during their exhibition bout. Sonnen has been noticeably improving his physique in recent TV appearances, while Silva has stayed training with his sons Gabriel and Kalyl, the latter of whom features on the undercard. And , Silva’s coach Luiz Dorea detailed how he is looking like a man in his prime despite his advanced age. “His condition is above normal,” the coach explained. “His age doesn’t reflect the reality. “He’s 49 but looks 10, 15 years younger. The way he moves, his notion of time and distance and how fast he learns, his reflexes. You’ll see that on June 15. I always say the knockout is the consequence of good hands that connect. “And Anderson is ready to connect and go for the knockout. I believe Sonnen is taking care of himself, because Anderson is coming in his best shape and motivated to fight in Brazil.” Despite the fact the fight is an exhibition, Silva is training as if it were a full pro bout with Dorea adding: “Anderson always respects all of his opponents. He’s a boxer now. He was doing boxing for , with kicks and takedowns. “But we’ve been working on pure boxing for the past four or five years so he’s a complete professional now. He’s a heavyweight that moves like a lightweight, basically. That’s rare, brother.” Anderson Silva’s coach brand Chael Sonnen ‘a complete athlete’ ahead of trilogy The first two meetings between Silva and Sonnen went the way of the Brazilian, who landed submission and knockout victories after being dominated early in both outings. The American is renowned as a wrestler, but actually dropped his rival on the feet in their first fight. And despite never having boxed, there have been times when Sonnen has shown off decent hands in the cage. Dorea claims he is a well-rounded individual when it comes to combat, and one they are taking very seriously. “He’s a MMA athlete so he’s a complete athlete,” he said. “He’s experienced. Even though his background isn’t boxing, he can throw punches and defend himself, has good timing and distance and experience, so we can’t underestimate him. “Sonnen deserves respect for everything he’s done in the sport, and Anderson is very professional in how he’s approaching this match, because he wants to deliver a big show for the fans.”",

        "content": "Furiosa won the holiday box office over Garfield by a hair. It was a close race, but the wasteland warrior of “ Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga ” came out slightly ahead of the plump orange cat with an estimated $32 million in ticket sales over the four-day weekend according to studio estimates Monday. “ The Garfield Movie ,” a Sony release, earned $31.1 million in its first four days. The dust won’t officially settle on the showdown until Tuesday when final numbers are reported, but for now at least Warner Bros. has the No. 1 movie in the country. Including international showings, its running global earnings are at $64.8 million. But victory is a long way off for the $168 million production starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth. George Miller’s prequel stormed theaters riding on great reviews and was expected to have at least a slightly stronger debut. For Sony, the launch of the more modestly budgeted “The Garfield Movie” is a win even without the bragging rights of being in first place. The animated film featuring the voice of Chris Pratt is likely to have a long life at the box office the summer holiday beginning for school age children. With its early international release, “The Garfield Movie” has already earned over $91.1 million against its $60 million production budget. But this weekend has also been a sobering one for Hollywood as one of the worst Memorial Day weekend box office showings in decades , excluding 2020 when theaters were closed. Ticket sales are down 22% from 2023 and the gap may just get bigger as the summer goes on. Remember, at this point last year “Barbenheimer” hadn’t even happened . Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Monday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Tuesday. 1. “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” $32 million. 2. “The Garfield Movie,” $31.1 million. 3. “IF,” $21 million. 4. “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” $17.2 million. 5. “The Fall Guy,” $7.7 million. 6. “The Strangers: Chapter 1,” $6.9 million. 7. “Sight,” $3.6 million. 8. “Challengers,” $1.8 million. 9. “Back to Black,” $1.4 million. 10. “Babes,” $1.2 million.

        "content": "JLGutierrez The Q2 ’24 Atlanta GDP Nowcast is projecting mid 3% GDP for the 2nd quarter, 2024. The scheduled GDP release this Thursday, May 30, ’24, is the 2nd look at Q1 ’24 GDP and the 2nd estimate is expecting 1.3% – 1.5%. The deflator, which is part of the GDP release and measures goods and services prices, is expected at +3.1% per the Briefing.com calendar. At a recent JPMorgan lunch in Oak Brook, Illinois, members of the fixed-income team were on hand, and given all of the inflation measurements that are populating the blogs and social media, I had to ask the team what – in their opinion – was or is the most important inflation measure(s) to be followed, and their immediate response was Core CPI and Core PCE data. Friday morning, we get Core PCE data for April ’24, and overall April PCE data is expected at +0.2%, while the April Core PCE data is expected at +0.3%. Don’t forget about “inflation expectations” One thing you learn studying money and banking and economics for that matter, is that while so much financial media attention is rooted in “inflation data” (actual inflation, which is important for sure), the more telling aspect of inflation is “inflation expectations” and one of only two measures that tracks this critical measurement, is the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Data, which was last released on Friday, May 24, 2024. This chart, cut-and-pasted from Briefing.com, shows the last two bullet points under “Key Factors” that both year-ahead and long-run inflation expectations have seen inflation expectations revised lower. Note in particular that last bullet point under “Key Factors”: that data shows the long-run inflation expectations, both pre- and post-Covid, and note the data. For Friday’s April PCE data, any number hotter than normal will likely send Treasury yields higher and stocks lower, and vice versa, if the data starts to come in lower, given inflation expectations. However, without any weakness in economic data, particularly the labor market, it’s an easy argument to make (and many make it) that the Core CPI and Core PCE inflation data will remain elevated. It really is a remarkable US economy and US stock market on this Memorial Day, May 27th, 2024. Summary/conclusion Inflation data is now as closely watched as labor market data, and for good reason. Technicians this blog follows keep noting the rather “iffy” technical support around crude oil, and despite what the inflation data might show this week, if crude oil does drop below $70, it would likely lead to a rally in Treasuries and help out the inflation data in May and June ’24. Now the opposite applies too: lower-than-expected inflation data this week would be negated if crude oil spiked over $90, as Treasury yields would rise and the S&P 500 would likely correct or stagnate. The point is crude oil still matters, and it’s often ignored, but it ultimately impacts Treasuries and thus stock prices and impacts inflation metrics. On this Memorial Day, 2024, as American citizens, we are blessed with a $27 trillion US economy, a $46 trillion stock market, and a $51 trillion US bond market. Today, we are living in the greatest wealth-creation machine in the history of civilization, and the Americans we memorialize today for their service and sacrifice, truly paid the ultimate price. None of this is a prediction about inflation data. We’ll have to wait and see what the data holds this week. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investing can involve the loss of principal even for short periods of time. Readers should gauge their own comfort with market volatility and adjust their portfolios accordingly. Thanks for reading.

With this bundle usually going for $6,097, this is the lowest price we have seen to date, with only two previous discounts to speak of. You can find the mower with its normal battery amount currently discounted to the same rate, meaning you’re getting two extra batteries for no added cost while already saving you $1,098. You can also find a similar bundle on , down from $6,597. The comes stocked with four 10.0Ah batteries that allows it to cover up to 2 acres of land on a single charge (which can be slightly extended with the extra two batteries). Its four independent brushless motors are housed within the 42-inch weather-resistant steel cutting deck, equivalent to a 22-horsepower engine, allowing it to move at up to 8 MPH. You’ll have 10 cutting heights to choose from here, ranging from 1.5 inches to 4.5 inches, three different driving modes, as well as 3-in-1 functionality for mulching, bagging, or side-discharges. It also sports some premium features like the 32 LED lights laid out on its front, sides, and rear for those early morning or late evening jobs – and even Bluetooth connectivity and a USB charging port for devices. As part of its , Best Buy is offering the . Regularly fetching $1,949, in 2023 we saw this particular model drop farthest during Black Friday sales, where it was brought down to $1,499. With this colorway no longer being offered from Aventon directly, we’ve mainly seen it included in Best Buy flash sales since the start of the new year, with today’s deal coming in as a $450 markdown that returns costs to the third-lowest price we have tracked – not only matching Black Friday rates, but also matching Aventon’s current Memorial Day rate. It’s also among some of the , which you can read about in our or by heading below. This comes ready to carry you wherever needed around town with its 500W rear-hub motor (750W peak) paired alongside a fully-integrated 14.0Ah battery that provides a 60-mile travel range on a single charge. Using only its throttle you’ll top off at 20 MPH, but when utilizing the five different levels of pedal assistance, that limit is bumped up to 28 MPH. It also comes with a rear-mounted rack for carrying along cargo as well as front and rear fenders to protect the bike from any adverse elements during your journey. It features integrated head and taillights, with the rear lights offering a brake light function, and you’ll find a handy backlit LCD display attached to the handlebars that gives you real-time status of all the important metrics: speed, travel distance, pedal assistance settings, and battery levels. As I stated before, this lowered price currently matches rate, albeit there is one tradeoff worth noting – by sacrificing the colorway, you’ll receive a free extra battery from Aventon’s direct sale that doubles the e-bike’s mileage from 60 miles to 120 miles! Alongside its , Amazon is offering the , . Already down from its $200 price tag, it entered the new year at $150 before steadily rising at small rates until April, when we finally started seeing some short-lived price cuts before once more rising back up. Today’s deal comes in to shake up the stagnation as a combined 36% markdown off the going rate that gives you $72 in savings and drops costs to a new all-time low. This can be stowed away in your vehicle (or kept out for regular use thanks to the included accessory parts) for quick and effortless charging solutions whenever you find yourself far from any official charging stations. It features an LED display that conveys in-time information, as well as a smart chip that provides protection against lightning, leakage, grounding, over voltage, under voltage, over charge, over current, and overheating. You’ll also be able to fully monitor and control the device through your smartphone, letting you even schedule charging for 1 to 12 hours, with options to take advantage of off-peak hours. It is compatible with vehicles and plug-in hybrids that comply with the J1772 standard, requiring only a NEMA 14-50 outlet to plug the charger into. The savings this week are also continuing to a collection of other markdowns. To the same tune as the offers above, these all help you take a more energy-conscious approach to your routine. Winter means you can lock in even better off-season price cuts on electric tools for the lawn while saving on EVs and tons of other gear. and subscribe to the .",

        "content": "Portugal is present at ITB China, the largest tourism fair in China, which takes place between May 27th and 31st, with the country represented by a delegation of 20 companies, led by Turismo de Portugal. In a statement sent to the press, Turismo de Portugal explains that participation in ITB China aims to “explore opportunities for cooperation between tourism entities in both countries, encourage cooperation in the area of student training and the training of tourism professionals and encourage local companies investing in the Tourism industry in Portugal”. “It is effectively an issuing market with strategic importance, not only because of its size but also because of the history that unites us. Tourism plays a key role in deepening bilateral relations and achieving a greater balance in Portugal's trade balance with China”, says Carlos Abade, president of Turismo de Portugal, remembering that this coincides with the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Portugal and China. In addition to participating in the fair, the occasion will also be used to sign contracts with local companies to launch marketing campaigns to promote Portugal throughout China, also giving rise to a roadshow that will take place in Beijing, Guangzhou, and Macau, and which should bring together more than 200 Chinese companies and encourage meetings with CEOs of the main partners of the tourism operation. China is the largest outbound tourism market in the world, which is why it is viewed strategically, especially because it continues to be a market with high potential for Portugal, since, between January and February 2024, it was the 17th tourist market in external demand for the destination Portugal measured by the overnight stays indicator (share 1.3%) and occupied 14th place in the guests' indicator (share 2.1%) totalling 37.1 thousand.",

        "content": "The UK is set to bask in 'summer-like' temperatures as early as next week, with some areas seeing highs of 23C - but Brits will first have to get through outbreaks of rainy and unsettled weather . New weather maps from WXCharts show a comeback for warmer weather this June. Balmy conditions will see areas including Manchester and Birmingham reach temperatures as high as 23C from June 5, while areas around Wick and Inverness are set to sizzle at 21C. But in order to enjoy the sunshine, Brits will first have to face showers, and in some areas, possible flooding. It comes as the Met Office issued three different yellow weather warnings for rain and thunderstorms across the north of England, as well as large parts of central, southern and southwestern England. Brits will first have get through outbreaks of rain and unsettled weather ( Image: PA) Brits are also facing a Bank Holiday washout as low-pressure systems have brought some very wet weather to many areas over the weekend. And there is further bad news that the rain is expected to continue to come down throughout the week before there is a sign of change by the next weekend. But The Met Office has indicated warm weather this June will offer a welcome relief from the rain. It said: \"Low pressure will bring outbreaks of rain and showers through much of this week. However, there are hints that high pressure will return for the start of June and the start of meteorological summer at the weekend.\" BBC weather forecaster Tomasz Schafernaker said the weather this Bank Holiday weekend \"has been a little hit and miss\". He continued: \"Further showers are expected not just on Bank Holiday Monday but indeed the rest of the week. Temperatures will be normal, nothing spectacular but at least by the end of the week it does look as though these low pressures should finally pull away as we see high pressure building but the winds will still come in from the north so the certainly isn’t any major warm up in the forecast.” Met Office Deputy Chief Meteorologist Dan Harris warned of localised flooding for Scotland and northeast England but there could be drier weather in the west. He said: “The outlook for Bank Holiday Monday is for brighter, cooler and breezier conditions with scattered showers for England and Wales at first, but a steady drying trend from the west is likely. \"Northern Ireland could well start off fine but cool, and remain settled whilst feeling pleasantly warm in longer sunny spells. The focus for heavier showers is expected to transfer to Scotland and possibly northeast England, where again these could be slow moving, the heaviest of which could cause some temporary, localised issues such as flooded roads.\"",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died today, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ‘Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Related articles NBA star diagnosed with Bell’s palsy 'Untapped potential': NZ Breakers confirm savvy new signing Share this article",

        "description": "PARIS — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out ” Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years.",
        "content": "PARIS — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out ” Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday. When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him on this afternoon-into-evening match against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal’s last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday’s defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. “It’s difficult for me to talk,” said the Spaniard, whose 11⁄2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother’s lap in the stands. “I don’t know (if) it’s going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure.” While Nadal said it’s doubtful that he will enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note that he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Paris Olympics’ tennis competition will be held at the French Open’s site. When Monday’s match ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion simply unable to play at his usual level after 11⁄2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the crowd for the “incredible the amount of energy” it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the shouts of his two-syllable nickname echoed. Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; indeed, he’d never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances going back to his days as a teenager. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal’s other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal’s uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty beige chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday’s look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player, one coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday’s start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, he faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph ace and a 117 mph service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with a trademark on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain that level, and soon it was 2-all. Zverev later broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. “The amount of feelings I had on this amazing court during my entire tennis career is amazing. But now I’m 28,” Nadal said, then paused and corrected himself with a chuckle: “Well, no, 38. I would love to be 28!” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around and applaud right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!”",

        "content": "Monday, May 27, 2024 On Thursday, May 23, history was made as BARK Air ‘s first-ever flight departed from New York, carrying six dogs of varying breeds and eleven humans, including both passengers and crew, to Los Angeles. This milestone marks the beginning of a revolutionary approach to air travel, offering a unique, pet-friendly experience designed specifically for dogs and their human companions. BARK Air is the world’s first airline focused exclusively on canine comfort. The innovative service promises to transform the often stressful ordeal of traveling with pets into a joyful and comfortable journey. With a mission to prioritize the needs of furry passengers, BARK Air has redefined the flight experience from the ground up, ensuring a stress-free journey for both dogs and their owners. Upon booking a flight with BARK Air, human passengers are contacted by a dedicated concierge who gathers detailed information about their dogs and travel plans. This personalized approach ensures that each dog receives the best possible travel experience tailored to their specific needs. On the day of travel, passengers and their dogs arrive at the airport just one hour before the flight, bypassing the typical hassles associated with air travel. The check-in process is streamlined and efficient, eliminating the need for crates and avoiding stressful lines. At the gate, a highly skilled BARK Air concierge welcomes the dogs, helping them socialize and settle into their journey. The cabin is equipped with dog-centric features designed to maximize comfort and ensure a pleasant flight for all canine passengers. Traveling long distances with dogs, especially larger breeds that don’t fit in under-seat carriers, can be challenging. Traditional air travel often subjects dogs to cramped conditions or the stress of flying in cargo. BARK Air addresses these issues by offering a service that puts dogs first, allowing them to travel comfortably alongside their owners. The successful inaugural flight of BARK Air marks a significant step forward in pet-friendly air travel.

        "content": "CALGARY — Steve Blake has a powerful message — don’t give up on your dreams no matter what life throws your way. The Calgary golf professional is gearing up for playing in Canada's lone PGA Tour Champions event of the season while battling inoperable Stage 4 lung cancer. \"You may be handed a death sentence, but it doesn't mean life's over,\" said Blake, whose received the shocking diagnosis in September. \"You've still got a lot to give, so get out there and give something.\" Blake was given a sponsor exemption on Monday, his 56th birthday, to play in his hometown at the 2024 Rogers Charity Classic at Canyon Meadows Golf and Country Club from Aug. 16 to 18. \"The more I have something like this tournament coming up to look forward to, the more alive I feel,\" Blake said. \"I don’t feel like I’m sick. I feel like I’m just this normal guy who’s going to practise for this tournament coming up and hopefully I’ll be around for the next one and so on and so on. \"As devastating as something can sound, I think if you believe that you can conquer something, you will, especially if you have good support staff and family (and) friends.” Blake, who also competed at the PGA Tour Champions event in 2018 when the tournament was known as the Shaw Charity Classic, decided to apply for another exemption while in the midst of undergoing eight months of chemotherapy treatments. He is looking forward to playing the sport he loves, possibly alongside fellow Canadians Mike Weir and Stephen Ames. \"It’s incredible,” Blake said. \"The opportunity, it leaves you speechless obviously to compete again with these guys to be on the same stage. The situation being what it is, they were very open to receive my letter and have me in there.\" A non-smoker with an active lifestyle, Blake developed a nagging cough in August. “I made a deal with my wife that if it did get worse that I would go to the hospital,” said Blake. “Long story short, about 16 hours later and my wife had shown up by that time, sitting in emergency going through a bunch of tests and stuff and they came back with the diagnosis.” Blake faced his prognosis from his oncologist with his family by his side. \"We knew it wasn’t going to be good,” Blake said. \"He said 12 to 24 months, but I kind of really grabbed onto that and said, 'I just want this to be the starting point. Like, I’ll see you in 24 months and then we’ll discuss another prognosis if you’ve got another one for me.' \"Being able to look forward to something like this does so much for me mentally, physically, everything, just to get me psyched up to come out here and compete again.\" The devastating news was a shock to the system for Blake, his wife Kelly and their kids Connor, 25, and Brooklyn, 22, who are both accomplished athletes. \"When we told the kids, they were so emotional as well,\" said Kelly. \"We didn’t know if Steve would be well enough to golf, let alone out here (at Canyon Meadows).\" Connor is a defenceman playing hockey for the ECHL’s Adirondack Thunder, while Brooklyn is a midfielder with Calgary Foothills WFC. \"I’m always looking for something to take my mind off the illness,” said Blake, who works as a financial adviser. “I’m still trying to be very active in work. I’m still trying to be very active in golf and in my kids’ sports and things like that.\" After just missing out on qualifying to compete at the U.S. Senior Open Championship last year, Blake will attempt to earn a spot to play at this year’s tournament to be held at Newport Country Club in Newport, R.I., from June 27 to 30. \"Having something like the U.S. Senior Open qualifier to look forward to again, just the idea of being able to go down and compete, is something that’s really special to me and my wife,\" said Blake, who will tee it up for a qualifying round at Goose Creek Golf Club in Jurupa Valley, Calif., on Tuesday. “I’m fortunate I’ve played (Goose Creek) a couple times. I was close the last time I was down there. Hopefully, I just make a few more putts and we’ll see if we can get in the U.S. Senior Open again.\" Blake played at the major in 2018 at the Broadmoor Golf Club in Colorado Springs, Col. Although he missed the cut with rounds of 79 and 74, it gave him confidence that he could hold his own against the likes of World Golf Hall of Fame members Vijay Singh and Bernhard Langer. \"It’s just such a great opportunity to come out and compete with them,\" said Blake, who carded rounds of 70, 77 and 71 six years ago at Canyon Meadows to finish well back of winner Scott McCarron. \"It’ll be a little different than the last time.

        "content": "CALGARY — Steve Blake has a powerful message — don’t give up on your dreams no matter what life throws your way. The Calgary golf professional is gearing up for playing in Canada's lone PGA Tour Champions event of the season while battling inoperable Stage 4 lung cancer. \"You may be handed a death sentence, but it doesn't mean life's over,\" said Blake, whose received the shocking diagnosis in September. \"You've still got a lot to give, so get out there and give something.\" Blake was given a sponsor exemption on Monday, his 56th birthday, to play in his hometown at the 2024 Rogers Charity Classic at Canyon Meadows Golf and Country Club from Aug. 16 to 18. \"The more I have something like this tournament coming up to look forward to, the more alive I feel,\" Blake said. \"I don’t feel like I’m sick. I feel like I’m just this normal guy who’s going to practise for this tournament coming up and hopefully I’ll be around for the next one and so on and so on. \"As devastating as something can sound, I think if you believe that you can conquer something, you will, especially if you have good support staff and family (and) friends.” Blake, who also competed at the PGA Tour Champions event in 2018 when the tournament was known as the Shaw Charity Classic, decided to apply for another exemption while in the midst of undergoing eight months of chemotherapy treatments. He is looking forward to playing the sport he loves, possibly alongside fellow Canadians Mike Weir and Stephen Ames. \"It’s incredible,” Blake said. \"The opportunity, it leaves you speechless obviously to compete again with these guys to be on the same stage. The situation being what it is, they were very open to receive my letter and have me in there.\" A non-smoker with an active lifestyle, Blake developed a nagging cough in August. “I made a deal with my wife that if it did get worse that I would go to the hospital,” said Blake. “Long story short, about 16 hours later and my wife had shown up by that time, sitting in emergency going through a bunch of tests and stuff and they came back with the diagnosis.” Blake faced his prognosis from his oncologist with his family by his side. \"We knew it wasn’t going to be good,” Blake said. \"He said 12 to 24 months, but I kind of really grabbed onto that and said, 'I just want this to be the starting point. Like, I’ll see you in 24 months and then we’ll discuss another prognosis if you’ve got another one for me.' \"Being able to look forward to something like this does so much for me mentally, physically, everything, just to get me psyched up to come out here and compete again.\" The devastating news was a shock to the system for Blake, his wife Kelly and their kids Connor, 25, and Brooklyn, 22, who are both accomplished athletes. \"When we told the kids, they were so emotional as well,\" said Kelly. \"We didn’t know if Steve would be well enough to golf, let alone out here (at Canyon Meadows).\" Connor is a defenceman playing hockey for the ECHL’s Adirondack Thunder, while Brooklyn is a midfielder with Calgary Foothills WFC. \"I’m always looking for something to take my mind off the illness,” said Blake, who works as a financial adviser. “I’m still trying to be very active in work. I’m still trying to be very active in golf and in my kids’ sports and things like that.\" After just missing out on qualifying to compete at the U.S. Senior Open Championship last year, Blake will attempt to earn a spot to play at this year’s tournament to be held at Newport Country Club in Newport, R.I., from June 27 to 30. \"Having something like the U.S. Senior Open qualifier to look forward to again, just the idea of being able to go down and compete, is something that’s really special to me and my wife,\" said Blake, who will tee it up for a qualifying round at Goose Creek Golf Club in Jurupa Valley, Calif., on Tuesday. “I’m fortunate I’ve played (Goose Creek) a couple times. I was close the last time I was down there. Hopefully, I just make a few more putts and we’ll see if we can get in the U.S. Senior Open again.\" Blake played at the major in 2018 at the Broadmoor Golf Club in Colorado Springs, Col. Although he missed the cut with rounds of 79 and 74, it gave him confidence that he could hold his own against the likes of World Golf Hall of Fame members Vijay Singh and Bernhard Langer. \"It’s just such a great opportunity to come out and compete with them,\" said Blake, who carded rounds of 70, 77 and 71 six years ago at Canyon Meadows to finish well back of winner Scott McCarron. \"It’ll be a little different than the last time. It’ll be similar as far as having family and friends and the crowd around, which I so enjoy having. “I know in 2018, it was let’s just not embarrass myself while I’m out here too much. It will be different, just playing for something maybe just a little bit bigger than me.

        "description": "An NBA Hall of Famer, broadcaster, and member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team, Bill Walton, has passed away from cancer at 71.",
        "content": "NBA Hall of Famer and UCLA legend Bill Walton has passed away of cancer. He was 71. The announced Walton's death Monday. NBA commissioner Adam Silver released a statement on the two-time NBA champion. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,\" Silver said. \"As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. \"Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear, and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" Walton was a beam of light and one of the biggest and brightest stars in sports. His college and professional career was unmatched. The College Basketball Hall of Famer is a two-time NCAA champion, three-time National College Player of the Year, and a three-time Consensus first-team All-American. Walton was the Portland Trail Blazers' No. 1 pick in the 1974 NBA Draft. He spent 10 seasons in the NBA and was named a two-time All-Star, two-time All-NBA, 1977-78 NBA MVP, two-time All-Defense, and the 1985-86 Sixth Man. Walton spent his NBA career with the Blazers from 1974-79, the San Diego Clippers from 1979-85, and the Boston Celtics from 1985-88. His No. 32 is retired by the Trail Blazers. While Walton had a great career, he suffered numerous injuries throughout his historic career, including chronic foot injuries, a sprained ankle, a twice-broken left wrist, two dislocated toes, two dislocated fingers, a broken toe. He also injured his leg in a accident. These injuries limited his career totals, and he decided to call it quits after 14 seasons in the NBA. Walton finished his career averaging 13.3 points per game, 10.5 rebounds and 3.4 assists. The California native possibly had an even better post-playing career. Walton pivoted to college basketball commentary on national telecasts for ESPN, Sports, and Sports, among other outlets. He earned an Emmy Award for his analysis in 1991. Walton was a larger-than-life figure whose transcended basketball. He is survived by his wife, Lori, and four sons: Adam, Nate, Luke, and Chris.

        "content": "England star Jack Grealish has been linked with a shock exit from Manchester City, just three seasons after joining the club for £100 million (R2.3 billion). In what was arguably his toughest campaign in Manchester since his arrival from Aston Villa in 2021, the winger has finished the season with just three goals in 36 appearances. Reports suggest Grealish is unhappy with his reduced role this term, and could be interested in leaving the Citizens in the coming transfer window. Bayern Munich have been linked with the England international, who was named in Gareth Southgate's provisional 2024 UEFA European Championship squad, with Vincent Kompany reportedly eyeing a move for the player. The Belgian is expected to succeed Thomas Tuchel at the Allianz Arena after recently informing Burnley of his wish to take the opportunity in Bavaria. claims City could accept a big offer for Grealish should they receive one ahead of next season, with the winger still having three years on his deal at the Etihad Stadium. The ex-Villa captain made only 10 starts in the Premier League this season after injuries and the arrival of Belgian wide man Jeremy Doku seemed to impact his role in the side. Grealish was also an unused substitute in City's FA Cup final loss to Manchester United on Saturday, while he also played no part in the team's final three league games of the season.

        "content": "RTE's Ray D'Arcy has opened up about his decision to give up alcohol and how it was his wife that \"inspired him\". The popular radio host has been honest about his childhood growing up and how his late father \"drank a lot\" . The Irish presenter has now explained how his own decision to give up alcohol for good was nothing to do with his familial experiences. Speaking to the RTE Guide, Ray revealed that he has never had an issue with alcohol , but admitted that he \"hasn't looked back\" since choosing to quit over four years ago. The 59-year-old told how he made the active decision to stop while out for a run one day. He said: \"One day I was on holidays down the country, I’d had a few glasses of wine and the next day, out on a run, I felt a bit fuzzy, and I just thought, I’m going to give this up. There was no big deal about it. \"I hadn’t discussed it with anybody, I just decided it was something I was going to do.\" The Den star confessed that he \"didn't drink that much\" to begin with and explained how his wife Jenny had quit six years before him. Ray highlighted how Jenny had \"inspired him\" to make the move with how much \"it changed her life\". The dad-of-two described how his kids would ask him, \"Daddy, why don’t you quit?\" to which he would tell them: \"I just have the odd glass of wine on a Friday evening, I don’t drink enough to give it up.\" And the Kildare man emphasised how he \"feels lucky\" that he doesn't drink now. He added: \"It’s the even keel and you get so much more out of the weekends . Some people might think that’s very boring, but I find it very attractive.\" The RTE One host recently signed a new megabucks deal with RTE. The Irish Sun has learned that Ray penned a new contract in January to present his afternoon show on RTE Radio One . While RTE would not say if Ray had taken a cut on his €250,000-a-year salary, a spokeswoman said the station was “committed to reducing the cost of its highest paid presenters to ensure no contractors or employees will earn more than the Director-General” (currently Kevin Bakhurst). That move appears to fly in the face of Bakhurst’s recent vows of a commitment to “transparency”. Ex-Today FM boss Willie O’Reilly, who turned Ray into a star said in terms of audience RTE has made the right move to tie him down. He told The Irish Sun: “Ray has a very good track record . If RTE put someone new and untested in there, they could lose 20 per cent of their audience in three months. “Ray has proven to constantly deliver big audiences. People have grown up with Ray and have an ingrained habit of listening to him in the afternoon.” Willie hailed the deal as a “clever move” by RTE bosses. Willie told us: “When you have a radio schedule, you don’t want to change too many things.\"",

        "content": "A TikTok creator has shared a genius way to eat chicken balls from her local Chinese takeaway – but the final product features no chicken at all. Nadine Campbell (@Nadz_xxxx) had foodies drooling after she revealed the hack , which involves removing the chicken from the batter and replacing it with rice and curry sauce. A video sharing the recipe had already been viewed two million times at the time of writing and saw her explain the technique after biting open the crispy ball. \"I pull out the chicken and then I take fried rice and curry and mix it together,\" she said. \"I then stuff it inside the chicken ball – I've eaten them like this since I was young – and I will never eat them [any] other way. Woman's 'life-saving' hack stops food going bad – you only need one ingredient \"I get chips and stick them inside and that's how I eat my chicken balls. It's delicious.\" Nadine warned viewers the technique \"works better\" with thicker batter. She captioned the clip: \"Anyone else eat them like this or just me?\" And it appeared several others do. One takeaway fan responded: \"Omg I thought I was the only one that did that!\" Another wrote: \"In my 24 years of living, I’ve never ever seen anyone else do this! I’m so happy!\" Meanwhile a third added: \"That's how I eat mine! without the chips though.\" The trick involves removing the chicken from the chicken balls altogether ( Image: @nadz_xxxx / TikTok) To everyone else, however, it was a new trick – and many hungry followers thanked Nadine for the suggestion. \"I feel like the last 42 years I was merely existing and now I am living with this recommendation,\" said one inspired TikTok user. A second wrote: \"I’m going to have to try this next time I have a Chinese, it looks amazing.\" A third agreed: \"What in the magical world of Harry Potter have I just witnessed?\" And a fourth gushed: \"Why have I not been doing this? Thanks darling!\" This isn't the first time Nadine has shared a food hack to social media, with Chinese takeaway often her cuisine of choice. Her \"plate-ups\" often cause controversy with her most recent combination of noodles, rice, and a variety of curries proving to be divisive. She's not the only one who loves a takeout – we Brits love putting our own stamp on some of the world's most treasured cuisines, often receiving mixed reactions for our takes on culinary classics. Earlier this month, Ruiz Asri, who runs the popular food blog and media site Honest Food Talks , told the Mirror: \"The history of a Chinese takeaway in the UK can be traced back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when Chinese immigrants began arriving in the country. \"The majority of the early Chinese immigrants were seamen from southern China , primarily from the Guangdong province. Many of them were drawn to the port cities of Liverpool and London, where they opened small, family-run eateries known as 'chop suey houses' to provide other immigrants with a taste of home and create a sense of community in their new home.\"",

Sarah Allen, who is a Peverell ward councillor, was chosen to contest the seat which Conservative MP Sir Gary Streeter stands down from after 27 years. Sarah, who works for an union and is the chair of ’s Audit and Governance Committee, said it was a “huge honour” to be selected to run in the July 4 election. “There are no ‘no-go’ areas for Labour in this election,” said Sarah, who overturned a significant Conservative majority to win her council seat in 2019. “I have lived in the and I know its communities well. I also know that 14 years of the Conservatives have left their mark on our corner of Devon. \"Farmers are struggling to make ends meet, rural poverty is endemic and you simply don’t know if an ambulance will arrive when you need it. “It’s time for a change and that’s why I want to fight to improve the lives of people right across the constituency as South West Devon’s representative in parliament under a Labour government,” said Sarah, who is a parent of two children. Sue Dann, who is chair of the South West Devon Constituency , said Sarah brings a “wealth of experience” to the role. “She knows the struggles families have to make ends meet,” said Sue. “Her work highlights the pressures in our schools, whilst her role as a councillor gives her firsthand knowledge of the importance of good local public services. Sarah will be the change we need to make sure our local needs become a priority.” Sarah, who grew up in rural Herefordshire, said she “can’t wait” to get out to speak to people across the constituency. “I will be talking to people about our hope for Britain's future, people are crying out for change and I will work tirelessly to deliver it for the people of South West Devon.”",

        "description": "The 22-time major champion is targeting the Olympics in Paris and is not keen on switching to grass",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal is set to miss Wimbledon next month and may never play at the All England Club again as retirement looms. The 37-year-old, who has won two Wimbledon titles amongst his collection of 22 grand slams, was beaten by Alexander Zverev in straight sets in the first round of the French Open. Nadal insists he will compete at Roland Garros again as he targets the Paris Olympics in two months and, as a result, put his presence on the grass at Wimbledon into serious doubt. Asked whether he thinks he will play on grass and at Wimbledon, he said: “[It] looks difficult, honestly. For me now, it looks difficult to make the transition to grass when we have the Olympics again on clay. “I cannot confirm anything, I need to analyse so many facts. I don’t think it’s going to be smart after all the things that happen to my body, to make a transition to a completely different surface, then come back to clay. “Today I don’t think that’s a good idea, I don’t think it’s a positive idea right now.” Nadal has won Wimbledon twice, in 2008 and 2010, and last competed in SW19 in 2022 when he reached the semi-finals before being forced to withdraw from his semi-final against Nick Kyrgios due to injury. The Spaniard was then absent from the rest of the 2022 season before the array of fitness issues which triggered his “farewell tour” announcement for this year. However, despite this, Nadal is unwilling to confirm his retirement date. Nadal’s first Wimbledon triumph in 2008 was an all-time five-set classic, as he beat Roger Federer in fading light for his first major outside of Paris. He had previously lost to Federer in two consecutive finals and the last time he lost a match he completed at Wimbledon was indeed to the now-retired Swiss legend, in 2019.",

        "content": "By RNZ Rodger Fox - who has been synonymous with big band jazz in New Zealand - has died aged 71. The jazz legend founded the Rodger Fox Big Band in 1973 and toured extensively here and overseas, playing at international jazz festivals including Montreaux, Monterey and New Orleans. He also taught at the New Zealand School of Music in Wellington . The trombonist was honoured in 2022 for his services to music. Fox was only 18 when he began playing with a dance band in the Wellington / Porirua area. He told RNZ in 2022 that two of the biggest highlights were playing at Europe’s legendary Montreaux Jazz Festival in 1980 - the first-ever NZ band invited to play at an international jazz festival - and hosting American jazz saxophonist Michael Brecker’s visit to New Zealand to celebrate the Rodger Fox Big Band’s 30th anniversary. -RNZ Share this article",

        "content": "27 May 2024 Thousands buried alive after Papua New Guinea landslide By Emily Wither Officials in Papua New Guinea have appealed for international help – warning that more than 2,000 people may have been buried alive under a landslide that occurred three days ago. The mountainside collapsed in the early hours of Friday while people were sleeping, burying six villages in the isolated Enga province, 600 kilometres from the capital Port Moresby. More than 150 houses were inundated by piles of debris almost two storeys high.

        "content": "The match of the 18th round of the Turkmenistan Football Championship between the local \"Nebitchi\" and \"Energetik\" from Mary ended sensationally in Balkanabat. FC \"Energetik\" has been performing extremely poorly this season. Before this match, the team had suffered 13 defeats in 15 games played, without a single victory, firmly occupying the last place in the country's championship. Therefore, few doubted before the game that the outsider would be able to put up a real fight away against the bronze medalist of last year's national championship. Moreover, the first meeting of these opponents in Mary ended with a 3:2 victory for \"Nebitchi\". However, as events on the field of the \"Sport Toplumy\" stadium showed, the guests were resolutely determined for the game. Having scored a goal in the 40th minute thanks to the efforts of Abdyresul Abdyev, the players of Dovlet Bayramov kept their goal intact in the second half as well. Having won their first victory in the Turkmenistan-2024 championship with a score of 1:0, \"Energetik\" with 5 points is still at the bottom of the standings. And \"Nebitchi\", having suffered their second defeat in a row, missed the chance to overtake \"Ashgabat\" and remained in 7th place with 15 points. In the other three matches of the 18th round, as expected, the leaders won again. \"Arkadag\", reigning champion of Turkmenistan, was losing 0:1 in the match on their home field against \"Shagadam\" from Turkmenbashi during the course of the meeting – the score was opened in the 14th minute by Rovshen Begjanov. However, later Vladimir Bayramov's players scored three goals against the opponent and won a hard-fought victory – 3:1. The winners were marked by: Shanazar Tirkishov (20th minute), Abdy Byashimov (32nd) and Begench Akmamedov (88th). The Ashgabat \"Altyn Asyr\" also won a hard-fought home victory over \"Merv\" – 5:2, initially losing 0:1 after an accurate shot in the 10th minute by Shazada Byashimov. However, then Yazguly Hojageldiev's players seized the initiative and scored five goals against the opponent. The winners had a brace from Arslan Saparov (23rd and 52nd minutes) and one each from Zafar Babajanov (30th), Selim Nurmyradov (44th – from a penalty) and Rovshengeldi Halmamedov (68th). Ali Haydarov scored the second goal for \"Merv\" in the 77th minute. In another match of the round in Ashgabat at the \"Nisa\" stadium, the two-time participant of the AFC Champions League \"Akhal\" convincingly defeated \"Kopetdag\" – 4:0, taking revenge for the 2:3 defeat in the first round. In the team of the Main Department \"Turkmennebitonumleri\", Alibek Abdyrakhmanov scored a brace (44th and 45th minutes), while Elman Tagaev (12th) and Gurban Annaev (54th) each scored a goal. Thus, based on the results of these matches, which completed the second round of the Turkmenistan Football Championship 2024, the leading trio looks as follows: in first place – \"Arkadag\" (48 points), in second – \"Altyn Asyr\" (37 points) and in third – \"Akhal\" (34 points). After the 18th round, there was a break in the national football championship due to the preparation of the Turkmenistan national team for the 2026 World Cup qualifiers against the teams of Uzbekistan on June 6 in Tashkent and Hong Kong on June 11 in Ashgabat.",

        "content": "New Delhi [India], May 27 (ANI): Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday congratulated Gitanas Nauseda on being re-elected as Lithuania's President. Nauseda was re-elected in the final round of the Baltic nation's presidential elections, as partial results showed him far ahead in the two-way race against his opponent, Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte. \"Congratulations to H.E. @GitanasNauseda on being re-elected as the President of the Republic of Lithuania. I look forward to working together to further strengthen the close cooperation between India and Lithuania,\" PM Modi wrote in a post on X. https://x.com/narendramodi/status/1795088401256919453 Notably, this is the second time Nauseda and Simonyte have competed in presidential run-off elections. Earlier in 2019, Nauseda beat Simonyte and bagged victory with 66 per cent of the vote. Ballots from nearly 90 per cent of polling stations on Sunday showed Nauseda, 60, winning roughly three-quarters of the vote, followed by Simonyte, 49, from the ruling centre-right Homeland Union party. Following his re-win, Simonyte conceded defeat while speaking to reporters and congratulated Nauseda. As president, Nauseda has a semi-executive role, which includes heading the armed forces, chairing the defence and national security policy bodies, and representing the country at NATO and European Union summits. The former senior economist with the Swedish banking group SEB, who is not affiliated with any party, won the first round of the election on May 12 with 44 per cent of the votes, short of the 50 per cent he needed for an outright victory, reported Al Jazeera. Moreover, Simonyte was the only woman out of eight candidates in the first round and came in second with 20 per cent. (ANI)",

        "description": "Study: GPT-4 can potentially make you more money on your trade investments by Paul Hill A new study freely published in the SSRN journal has found that large language models (LLMs) with large context windows, such as GPT-4 and Claude 3, can perform successful financial statement analyses to help determine the direction of future earnings. The study found that AI exhibited “a relative advantage over human analysts in situations when the analysts tend to struggle.” In addition, the researchers found that general LLMs were able to perform just as well as narrowly trained state-of-the-art machine learning models that had been trained to read financial statements. They also found that LLMs were able to make predictions that yield a higher Sharpe ratio which compared the return of an investment with its risk – the higher the Sharpe ratio, the better. Given these results, the researcher found that LLMs may be able to have a central role in decision-making when it comes to choosing investments. Interestingly, GPT-4 was able to outdo human investors just based on the financial statements alone, devoid of any context, which the human investors would have been aware of. The researchers also said that the LLM predictions do not come from its training memory but rather “generates useful narrative insights about a company’s future performance.” For investors out there who think this work sounds interesting, the researchers have created a ChatGPT bot which is available to ChatGPT Plus subscribers so they can submit financial statements and get an analysis. For anyone interested in analysing financial statements for free, Claude 3 allows you to upload documents and you can ask questions about the data too. While the researchers may be wondering if LLMs can replace human investors, another qualitative change with the availability of these tools is that hobby investors who may not know the ins and outs of financial documents, can get a better idea of what’s going on with various companies.

        "content": "Egypt is considering adjusting the price of subsidized bread to better reflect the soaring cost of production, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly announced on Monday. However, he reassured the public that bread subsidies “will continue.” Speaking during a tour of industrial projects in the Borg Al-Arab area of Alexandria Governorate, Madbouly emphasized the need for action. “There must be a move to make the selling price of bread commensurate with the tremendous increase in cost,” he said. “Egypt produces 100bn subsidized loaves annually, and we sell the loaf for only 5 piasters, meaning that we collect EGP 5bn from total sales.” This move comes as the Egyptian government grapples with a significant financial burden. Finance Minister Mohamed Maait revealed in March that Egypt has allocated over EGP 125bn to subsidize bread in the 2024-2025 budget. The current subsidy benefits approximately 70 million Egyptian citizens, constituting about 65% of the population. Addressing the Electricity Crisis In related news, Madbouly addressed the ongoing electricity outage crisis, stating, “We asked the Ministries of Petroleum and Electricity to stop load shedding by November or December at the latest.” Egypt experienced an electricity crisis last July, its first since 2014, which the government attributed to a heatwave. Officials promised to resolve the issue by increasing gas pressure and ensuring the availability of petroleum materials for electricity networks. However, these promises have not been fully realized. Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, Tarek El-Molla, stated on Monday that strategies are being developed to close the gap between available resources and the actual cost of providing electricity. The goal is to achieve this by the end of the year, though a specific timeframe remains uncertain due to its dependence on broader economic reform measures. El Molla acknowledged the negative impact of this gap on both citizens and the state, noting that electricity was not cut off during Ramadan or Eid. He emphasized that the government is working towards complete and sustainable solutions. The minister also highlighted the financial strain on the petroleum sector, which provides fuel supplies worth $55bn annually at actual costs of $20-22bn. This figure includes extraction and production costs borne by international companies, as well as an annual import bill of $10-12bn, which fluctuates with exchange rates and global Brent crude oil prices.",

        "content": "A new study freely published in the SSRN journal has found that large language models (LLMs) with large context windows, such as and , can perform successful financial statement analyses to help determine the direction of future earnings. The study found that AI exhibited “a relative advantage over human analysts in situations when the analysts tend to struggle.” In addition, the researchers found that general LLMs were able to perform just as well as narrowly trained state-of-the-art machine learning models that had been trained to read financial statements. They also found that LLMs were able to make predictions that yield a higher Sharpe ratio which compared the return of an investment with its risk – the higher the Sharpe ratio, the better. Given these results, the researcher found that LLMs may be able to have a central role in decision-making when it comes to choosing investments. Interestingly, GPT-4 was able to outdo human investors just based on the financial statements alone, devoid of any context, which the human investors would have been aware of. The researchers also said that the LLM predictions do not come from its training memory but rather “generates useful narrative insights about a company’s future performance.” For investors out there who think this work sounds interesting, the researchers have created a which is available to subscribers so they can submit financial statements and get an analysis. For anyone interested in analysing financial statements for free, Claude 3 allows you to upload documents and you can ask questions about the data too. While the researchers may be wondering if LLMs can replace human investors, another qualitative change with the availability of these tools is that hobby investors who may not know the ins and outs of financial documents, can get a better idea of what’s going on with various companies.

        "content": "Steve Blake, one of Calgary’s best golfers, had a tee-time booked on that mid-September day. Except he had promised his wife that if his nagging cough worsened, he would go the emergency room for further examination of what doctors initially suspected to be a case of pneumonia. Instead of teeing it up at his home club, he drove to the hospital instead. After a series of tests, Blake received devastating news. He was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer, a complete shock for an active family man and non-smoker in his mid-50s. It is, unfortunately, inoperable. “My oncologist, the day we met him and he sat down and went through everything with us as far as the diagnosis, he asked, ‘Would you like to know your prognosis?’ ” Blake said, choking up as he recounted this moment. “I looked at my family and said, ‘Yeah, I do.’ We knew it wasn’t going to be good. He said 12 to 24 months, and I really grabbed onto that. I said, ‘I just want this to be the starting point. I’ll see you in 24 months ... ’ ” In August, at roughly the 11-month mark, you will see Blake inside the ropes at the 2024 Rogers Charity Classic at Canyon Meadows Golf & Country Club. Tournament officials announced Monday, on his 56th birthday, that the Calgarian has been granted an exemption to compete alongside the legends on the PGA Tour Champions circuit. This will be his second appearance at the award-winning and record-setting tournament, set this summer for Aug. 16-18. “The opportunity, it kind of leaves you speechless,” said Blake, who works as a financial advisor and is a member at Hamptons Golf Club. “In 2018, it was, ‘Let’s just not embarrass myself while I’m out here.’ This time, it will be different. I’m maybe playing for something a little bigger than me. I hope people see the message and see that somebody with an illness like this can still get out there and still pursue their dreams. “You may be handed a death sentence, but it doesn’t mean life is over,” he added, fighting back tears as he credited his family — wife Kelly, son Connor and daughter Brooklyn — and friends for helping him to remain upbeat. “You still have a lot to give, so get out there and give it. The more you do that, the more I have something like this tournament to look forward to, the more alive I feel. I don’t feel like I’m sick. I feel like I’m just this normal guy who is going to practise for this tournament coming up and hopefully I will be around for the next one and so on and so on.” Blake, who has completed chemotherapy and is now receiving a weekly round of targeted treatments, is the first confirmed entrant for the 2024 Rogers Charity Classic. There will be bigger names added to the tee-sheet, dudes with major titles and World Golf Hall of Fame credentials, but you won’t likely find a more heartwarming and inspiring story. Regardless of his score or his spot on the leaderboard, you can bet Blake will be a fan favourite during the three-round senior shootout at Canyon Meadows. As he put it: “If I can make a positive difference, even to one person that is struggling with this terrible disease, then I would consider any result in the tournament a total success.” “The patron group and Rogers continue to bring this event to Calgary to showcase the stars of the PGA Tour Champions to Canadian golf fans and to make a positive impact on the people in our community,” said Sean Van Kesteren, the executive director for the Rogers Charity Classic, in Monday’s announcement. “Giving one of Calgary’s top senior golfers, who needs the support of our entire community right now, this opportunity to play in front of his friends and family is not only extremely rewarding but supports this mission.” Blake admittedly wrestled with whether to request an exemption, which allows him to skip a two-part qualifying process. As he wrote a letter to tournament officials, he was asking himself: “Do you want to put yourself out there, with the illness, in front of everybody?” So why take this shot? Because Blake, who recently switched to senior shafts in his clubs as he tries to generate some of the speed that he’s lost in his golf swing, is a big believer in the power of positivity. During the 2024 Rogers Charity Classic, he wants to be proof of it. “You really have to believe that you can get past this or at least live as long as you can with it,” Blake said. “Unfortunately, too many people have that meeting with their oncologist. Too many family members have sat in on meetings like that. The devastation that you feel for the first period — it might be a week, two weeks, a month, two months, whatever — it can bury you. You just can’t allow it to bury you. You can’t allow it to define you. “I’m fortunate to have very positive people around me, always pulling for me, so it was a little easier to dig out of that initial hole. You just can’t let it beat you down and keep you down. If you do, chances are that prognosis is going to come true.”",

        "description": "Netanyahu denounced pressure, both internal and external, that he said his government has faced since the war began.",
        "content": "JERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on May 27 that a deadly strike that hit a displacement camp in Gaza’s Rafah was a “tragic accident” which his government was investigating. “In Rafah, we evacuated a million uninvolved residents and, despite our best efforts, a tragic accident happened yesterday,” Netanyahu told parliament. He added that “we are investigating the case and will draw the conclusions” after Gaza’s health ministry reported 45 dead as the strike late on May 26 sparked a fire that tore through a tent city for displaced Gazans. The ministry in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip also said that 249 people were wounded. Israel faced a wave of international condemnation on May 27 over the Rafah strike, including from across the region as well from the European Union, France and the United Nations. The Israeli military said it had launched a probe into the strike which it said was carried out based on “precise intelligence information” about two Hamas militants who it said were killed. It also said “the strike did not occur in the humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi, to which the IDF (army) has encouraged civilians to evacuate” since the ground operation began in Rafah. Netanyahu struck a defiant tone in his Knesset address while being heckled by relatives of hostages held in Gaza, and vowed to keep up the battle to destroy Hamas. “There is no substitute for absolute victory” in Gaza, he told the chamber. Netanyahu denounced pressure, both internal and external, that he said his government has faced since the war in Gaza began. “They pressured us then,” said Netanyahu, before listing calls to refrain from military operations which Israel carried out anyway. “Don’t enter Gaza. We entered! Do not enter Shifa! We entered! Do not enter Khan Yunis! We entered! Do not enter Rafah! We entered!” he said. “I don’t give up and I won’t give up! I stand up to pressures from home and abroad.” The Gaza war broke out after the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.

        "description": "The News Mill",
        "content": "Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday said that the clearing out of the mafia from the state has resulted in large-scale investment flow into the Purvanchal region of the state. He added that the projects being set up in the region will facilitate jobs for a large number of youths from the region. Addressing a public meeting in Mohammadabad in favour of party candidate Neeraj Shekhar from the Ballia Lok Sabha seat, the Chief Minister took a dig at the Samajwadi Party, pointing out that while the party vowed to kill the poor, he has resolved to eliminate the mafia from Uttar Pradesh and has succeeded in this pursuit. He added “After Ayodhya and Kashi, we are preparing to head towards Mathura.” While paying heartfelt tribute to the revolutionaries, he emphasized the numerous aspirations of the late Krishna Anand Rai for the Mohammadabad region. “Rai was deeply concerned about the area’s development and consistently working towards achieving this goal. Yet, whenever leaders like Krishna Anand Rai endeavoured to foster development, they fell victim to mafia violence. Rather than expressing condolence on Krishna Anand Rai’s tragic demise, these people protected murderers. And now, they are lamenting the death of the mafia,” he remarked. “Along with Krishna Anand Rai, Shyam Shankar Rai, Ramesh Rai, Ramesh Patel, Munna Yadav, and others were brutally murdered. At that time, the state was under the SP government and the central government was led by the Congress. Whenever these two parties come together, chaos follows. We cannot afford to let such chaos happen again,” CM said. Yogi said that the SP and Congress should be reminded whether Munna Yadav and Ramesh Patel, who were killed by mafias like Mukhtar, were not from backward castes. “Was Pooja Pal’s husband Raju Pal and Jaya Pal’s husband Umesh Pal in Prayagraj not from backward castes? Their resolve was to kill the poor’s sons, and ours is to eradicate the mafias”, he quipped. Yogi Adityanath said that people should be proud of living in an environment that was envisioned by the first freedom fighters of the country, Mangal Pandey and Chittu Pandey. “PM Modi is making efforts to realise the dreams of Krishna Anand Rai, who was concerned about the development of Mohammadabad. PM Modi is also fulfilling the aspirations of former Prime Minister Chandrashekhar regarding the region”, he remarked. “Today, wherever we go in the country, we encounter the same sentiment and determination. People are saying, ‘Fir Ek Baar Modi Sarkaar, Abki Baar, 400 Paar’. It’s a cause of concern for the SP, which is contesting only 60-62 seats. Furthermore, they have given tickets to Yadavs from a single family”, he added. The Chief Minister said that he brought Nirahua from Mumbai and entrusted him with the responsibility of Azamgarh. Since Nirahua became an MP, Azamgarh has witnessed the establishment of an airport, a university, the Purvanchal Expressway, a medical college, a nursing college, and a music college, Yogi asserted, pointing out that wWhen competent individuals are elected, development naturally follows. Hitting out at the opposition, Yogi stated that the Congress, in its manifesto, declares that if they come to power, they will implement personal law. “This means daughters would be deprived of education, women wouldn’t be able to go out, and they would have to remain confined to their homes in burqas. However, we will not allow India to be governed by Sharia law or permit a Taliban-like regime to take over”, he remarked. Yogi remarked that the Congress promises to impose an inheritance tax if they come to power, proposing a survey of our ancestors’ properties and allocating half to infiltrators from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. He likened this to Aurangzeb’s ‘Jizya’ tax. “Today, even a civilized Muslim would not name their son Aurangzeb because he imprisoned his father, denied him water, and killed his brother. Aurangzeb imposed the Jizya tax, demanding conversion to Islam or payment of the tax. We will not allow a return of Aurangzeb’s practices”, CM Yogi asserted. He concluded, “Today, India’s respect has grown on the global stage, and our borders are secure. Terrorism and Naxalism have been eradicated. If even a firecracker goes off loudly, Pakistan feels compelled to offer an explanation. They understand that the new India does not provoke, but it does not hesitate to retaliate. During the SP regime, the ration meant for the poor was consumed by the mafia. Now, 80 crore people receive free rations. PM Modi has lifted more people out of poverty than the entire population of Pakistan.” (ANI)",

        "content": "by: Cameron Kiszla Posted: May 27, 2024 / 11:01 AM PDT Updated: May 27, 2024 / 11:01 AM PDT A new front in the legal war over Arrowhead bottled water’s access to natural springs in the San Bernardino Mountains has opened up, reports the Los Angeles Times. While previous legal wrangling has sought to answer the question of whether Arrowhead parent company BlueTriton Brands is legally allowed to use water from the springs — bottled water has been taken from the creek and sold since 1906 — environmental activists are now petitioning the state to say the company’s use of water is hurting wildlife. According to Rachel Doughty, lawyer for the environmental nonprofit Story of Stuff Project, BlueTriton has “dewatered” Strawberry Creek. Doughty explained to the Times that if the company weren’t siphoning water in its network of pipes, Strawberry Creek “would be habitat for endangered species, it would be providing a downstream water supply, it would support fish, and it can’t do any of those things without water.” In an email to the Times, BlueTriton Brands said the company will “partner with people in our communities, governments, policy makers, businesses, and consumers to sustainably protect and shape our shared future.” “Responsible and proactive water stewardship is central to everything we do,” the company said. “We’re proud of the work we’ve done and continue to do in Strawberry Canyon, studying, reporting, and managing our operations to help protect the land and natural resources. We will continue to operate in compliance with all state and federal laws.” The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is evaluating the activists’ petition.

The video begins with a shot of the team bus being mobbed by supporters on its way to the stadium. The rest of the clip largely features highlights from the club’s 2023-24 season, with a motivational track being played underneath. Whatever was said in the dressing room ahead of kick-off clearly had some sort of effect, as the team escaped relegation in the final game of the season. They had been trailing Frosinone on points heading into the final day, and required a victory to leapfrog them out of the relegation zone. Cannavaro joined the club on a short-term deal until the end of the season back in April, having been called in as a replacement for Gabriele Cioffi. 🎥 Il video preparato da Mister Cannavaro e dal suo staff visto dai ragazzi prima della partita contro il Frosinone🔥🎯 🎥 The video prepared by coach Cannavaro and his staff which was shown to the players before the match against Frosinone🔥🎯 ⚪️⚫️ — Udinese Calcio (@Udinese_1896)",

        "content": "This year's cohort, which includes Samantha Barry from US Glamour and artist Oliver Jeffers, is honoured to serve as an inspiration to the university's graduates. It occurs amid a year of festivities honouring the university's 175-year history as the Belfast School of Art. Mr. Jeffers expressed his pride at having the opportunity to return to Belfast School of Art this summer. An institution that is “intrinsic to the city's artistic and cultural heritage” is the Belfast School of Art, where he formerly studied design for visual communication. “Now dividing my time between Belfast and New York, this award strengthens my connection with the place where I grew up and I am grateful to Ulster University for the honour,” he stated. “However, I do hope I'm never on a flight when they ask if there's a doctor on board,” he said. Ms. Barry, who is originally from County Cork and is currently residing in New York City as Glamour's global editorial director for the Americas, is being honoured for her accomplishments in journalism. She changed the publication's yearly Women of the Year awards to support diversity. “I am delighted to have been recognised by Ulster University for my work and so excited to be visiting this summer to join the occasion with thousands of graduates as they celebrate after years of hard work and prepare to embark on their careers,” she stated. Betty Carlisle will be honoured for her work advancing shared education and empowering women from underprivileged and deprived areas; Eamonn Mallie will be recognised for his significant contribution to journalism and broadcasting; and Sister Nuala Kelly will be honoured for her outstanding service to the community following her transformation of St. Louisa's College in west Belfast. Professor Paul Bartholomew, vice-chancellor of Ulster University, stated that the institution wants to honour remarkable locals who are having an international influence. “Graduation is a special time of year as we celebrate our outstanding graduates as they come together with friends and family to mark their wonderful achievements,” he stated. According to Professor Bartholomew, “We are dedicated to fostering the next generation of leaders who will, in the years that follow their time at Ulster University, go on to make a significant impact in their communities and respective professions.” “With that future in mind, it is a joy to celebrate the work of those inspirational and acclaimed local faces already making a global impact, and we are thrilled to bestow these honorary doctorates.” He went on to say, “these individuals are leaders in their fields and demonstrate great talent, creativity and integrity.” According to Professor Bartholomew, the institution is hoping that “they will be an inspiration to the whole Ulster University community.” The summer graduation ceremonies in Belfast, Coleraine, and Derry, which take place from July 1 to July 9, will award the honorary doctorates.",

        "content": "The fire broke out because of a short circuit and a probe into the fire incident is under way. The education department and district administration will submit a report regarding the blaze. New Delhi : It was a close shave for around 1,400 girl students who luckily escaped a blaze that swept through their school building in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Monday. According to rescue officials, the fire ripped through the Government Girls Higher Secondary School in Haripur district’s Sirikot village when students were studying inside the building. The fire brigades took some time to reach the site as they had to make their way through a treacherous mountainous terrain. Faraz Jalal, Haripur’s rescue 1122 spokesperson, said that all the students were safe after they were evacuated from the school building in time. Jalal added that there was massive damage to the entire school due to the blaze. The school building was built partially with wood. Fortunately, no loss of life was reported following the incident. Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry, Chief Secretary Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said that the fire broke out because of a short circuit. A probe into the fire incident is under way. Chaudhry said the school would be made functional soon. Timely evacuation Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur pointed out that timely action by rescue officials in evacuating the students averted a huge tragedy. He added that the education department and district administration will submit a report regarding the fire. Gandapur said a review of all educational institutions would be undertaken to prevent such fire incidents in the future. The provincial government will compensate for the losses caused by the blaze, he added. School buildings in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have often faced attacks by militants. On May 8 night, unidentified militants blew up a private girls’ school in Tehsil Shewa of North Waziristan district. The militants tortured the watchman and later blew up two rooms of the school, the police said. In May last year, two government schools for girls in Mirali had been destroyed by the militants. Luckily, there were no casualties in the incidents.",

        "content": "Surprisingly, bamboo is a grass, and there are many varieties that can be ‘clumpers ‘or ‘runners’ – all to do with their root growth and structure. Once fully grown, some of the larger species resemble trees with a thick trunk. Much more sustainable than hardwood trees, they are also one of the fastest-growing plants in the world, growing up to 90cm or more a day. Despite bamboo not being native to a lot of countries, Europe’s growing interest in bamboo has paved the way for a new generation of farmers, ecologists, and landscape designers who are introducing bamboo into their plans, and there are at least 5 European countries that are currently growing bamboo – starting with here in Portugal at Bambu Parque, plus La Bambouseraie en Cévennes, France - Labirinto della Masone - Italy, Oprins Nursery - Belgium, and lastly of all unlikely places, Scottish Bamboo in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. In less developed countries, unemployment has often resulted in conflicts and social unrest, but the production and manufacturing of bamboo products can contribute to a more socially and economically stable environment by creating job opportunities. Bamboo is an easy-to-grow crop that provides annual income to some of the poorest rural communities in tropical and subtropical regions, and its rapid establishment and growth allows for frequent harvesting that can be converted into an increasingly wide variety of products for sale, providing a year-round source of income. Strength It is incredibly strong, and an amazing number of things are made from bamboo, from flooring to furniture and worktops, kitchen equipment, and even sports equipment, plus reusable items such as coffee cups, drinking straws, plates, and bowels. Even clothing such as t-shirts, underwear, and socks can all be made with bamboo, and the companies who make them are proud to produce these sustainable products. Eco-friendly? Compared to wood from trees, bamboo wood is more stable, and because it is nearly always laminated or compressed, it has a higher density than most wood types, plus the bonus of being more fire resistant. Processing certainly creates work for those that need it, where the culms (the hollow part of the stem) are split lengthwise into strips and the outer bark is removed. The material is planed and treated (bleached or caramelised) before drying. The strips are then glued and stacked and pressed to form a laminated material. For manufacturing a bamboo fabric, leaves, and shoots are cooked in strong chemical solvents such as sodium hydroxide and carbon disulphide, both being highly toxic and risky for human health. Once cooked, the resulting liquid is pushed through tiny holes directly into a chemical bath of sulfuric acid (dangerous again) where it hardens into fine strands. But are any of the processing procedures so eco-friendly? Credits: envato elements; Bamboo Torture Less talked about is its more gruesome use during WW2. ‘Bamboo torture’ was apparently used on prisoners-of-war, where multiple sharpened shoots of this innocent ‘grass’ were placed beneath the back of a horizontal prisoner, like a bed of nails, and these would start piercing through the body and growing through, causing a slow and painful death. Despite this theory having never been confirmed, there is a huge possibility that it may have really been used. Panda Food I have always associated bamboo with pandas in an adorable way. I mean come on, look at them. Cuteness overload or what? Despite conservation projects, there are still less than 2,000 on our planet. A panda's daily diet consists almost entirely of the leaves, stems, and shoots of bamboo, and because it contains very little nutritional value, pandas must eat 12-38 kg every day to meet their energy needs. They lack the digestive enzymes necessary to break down other plants, thus making bamboo their only food source, and they have adapted bamboo into their diet over time due to its abundance in their mountain forest habitats. This adaptation has been aided by the evolution of specialized jaw muscles that allow them to easily chew through tough stalks of bamboo. They say they’re living proof that you can eat just vegetables and still be fat, so don’t start thinking being a vegetarian is all good!

        "content": "Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) National President JP Nadda on Monday lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi for bringing improvement in the lives of weavers in India and called him the “best ambassador of artists, weavers, and craftsmen of India.” JP Nadda also asserted that the weavers and artisans have witnessed a change in their lives under the leadership of PM Modi. “The change that has come in the lives of weavers after 2014 has been possible due to the strong leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 10 years ago, people thought that nothing was going to change in this country, such a mentality had developed. People had become indifferent.” He added, “But under PM Modi, the hopes and aspirations of the people have changed... Today, they feel that a leader can change the country. PM Modi has worked to encourage the weaver community in every way.” JP Nadda also said that PM Modi tried to infuse new energy in every sector, take it forward and fulfill even its smallest needs. “The weaver community has also not remained untouched by these efforts of Modiji. Many works have been done for their encouragement too,” he said. The remarks of the BJP National President came while he addressed the Bunkar Karigar Sammelan organised in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh. Addressing the conference, Nadda said, “PM Modi is the best ambassador of artists, weavers, and craftsmen in India. Whenever he meets any head of state, he presents art, craft or clothing made in any state of our country with its full explanation. During the G20 also, the commodities prepared by the weavers and artisans of India were given to the delegates.” Nadda also took a jibe at Congress and slammed it for forgetting Khadi. He said, “The slogan of Khadi was given by Mahatma Gandhi but in the last 70 years, the Congress had forgotten Khadi! In the last 10 years, under the leadership of the Prime Minister, many works have been done to empower the traditional skilled people like weavers, artisans, craftsmen etc.” Praising the ‘One District-One Product’ programme, Nadda said, “The ‘One District-One Product’ programme has given encouragement to this sector and has provided it with a global market. PM Modi’s efforts have brought positive changes in the lives of our people who are preserving our skills. Today, this society which is preserving our traditional art and culture is with the BJP.” The BJP National President also talked about Vocal for Local and called it the mantra of India’s economy. “I can say that Vocal for Local isn’t just a slogan or line, this is a mantra of India’s economy. It is the soul for making India ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat.’ And that is why, PM Modi worked to promote Vocal for Local,” Nadda said. JP Nadda in his address also asserted that the PM has taken care of every area of the country and as a result, those states which were considered as backward in the country are today among the leading states. “On June 4, PM Modi is going to become the Prime Minister for the third time and this will be a big news for the world... Nobody can stop India from moving ahead now,” he said",

        "description": "Suzi Walsh says using puppies in yoga classes raises concerns about consent, exploitation and animal welfare.",
        "content": "PUPPY YOGA CLASSES are increasingly popular around the world, enticing people with the allure of puppies as a unique attraction. Although new to Ireland, the experience around these classes and the welfare of puppies has in other jurisdictions. You can see why people might think it a good idea to go along, what’s not to love about a nice yoga class, complete with the cutest, softest and playful puppies? No harm, right? Well, maybe we should all stop here and ask ourselves: Are the puppies there because it’s good for them? What are they getting from it? Do they have a choice? What about their welfare? Am I satisfied they’ve made their way here today because this is ultimately for their good, or is this just for my entertainment? Let’s look at what exactly puppy yoga is and why it should be avoided... Puppy yoga is worryingly emerging as a new fitness trend where members of the public engage in yoga while interacting with puppies. Much of the time, in various locations around the world, organisers can be found claiming there are benefits to both the participants and the puppies. Some providers of this global craze contend that interaction with animals reduces stress and anxiety while helping with well-being (presumably for the yoga participants). While this holds true in theory, the reality is that all of this relies on the animals themselves being relaxed, calm and content. Additionally, the idea that there are benefits for the puppies here, that it allows them to strengthen their confidence and learn to behave out in the world really doesn’t stack up. My view is that socialising puppies in this manner is likely to have the opposite effect. Using puppies in yoga classes raises concerns about consent, exploitation and animal welfare. Exposing young, often untrained puppies to unfamiliar environments and handling by numerous strangers can be stressful and potentially harmful to their physical and emotional health. Puppy yoga has been designed to entice the public into booking expensive spots in what is essentially a standard yoga class. An investigation recently uncovered some disturbing truths about puppy yoga classes in the UK. The growing trend comes on the back of the rise of social media, where posts to Instagram and TikTok help raise the profile of many influencers. When the investigative reporter questioned if the puppies had access to water during classes, the response was that it would only cause the pups to urinate more. Dogs should never have restricted access to water, they have the inability to sweat or store water in the way that humans do and therefore they can overheat fast leading to potentially fatal consequences. During this investigation, it was discovered that some pups were as young as six and a half weeks old, barely weaned and unvaccinated. It found that some users would pay up to £40 British pounds for a session. In a commercial environment, dog yoga classes should adhere to the same standards as other enterprises involving animals. They should require a welfare officer or veterinary specialist to be on-site at all times. This is a standard practice in the TV & film industry, and yoga classes should be no different. The welfare of the pups should be a priority but that cannot be the case if the participants’ needs are prioritised over that of the puppies. In my opinion, such investigations demonstrate that yoga class is not an appropriate setting for young puppies. In my long experience as a dog behaviourist and trainer, socialisation is about introducing a young animal to something in a way which is gradual and calm, they must have the freedom to choose to move away. At such a young age, it is crucial for their confidence development to experience the world at their own pace without being overwhelmed. Negative experiences during the can impact their behavioural development. Introducing new experiences — such as meeting people, encountering other dogs, and exposure to various noises and objects — should be gradual, controlled and occur when the puppy is relaxed. While we often discuss the lack of socialisation for dogs, but I have learned in my many years of this work that overexposure or flooding a puppy with stimuli for their well-being. A poorly socialised puppy may become fearful of new people, animals, environments and experiences. This can result in chronic anxiety and stress. For example, some have criticised the practice of repeatedly handling a pup over the course of a yoga class, and having the puppy passed from one person to the next. This is likely to create an aversion to people as well as an avoidance of handling. There’s a significant distinction between a puppy genuinely enjoying being handled and one that is merely tolerating it. Fear and insecurity can manifest as aggression towards people, or unfamiliar situations. Without proper and gentle socialisation, a puppy may struggle to cope with changes or unexpected events, leading to overreaction or avoidance behaviours. Other criticisms include concerns that a yoga class is long for a puppy. They have short attention spans and need lots of rest. Puppies need plenty of food and lots of undisturbed sleep. This is very difficult to achieve if they are participating in several classes in addition to being transported to and from a venue. So where do the pups come from for this yoga? Certainly, the UK investigation that the craze can be ‘a sort of marketing tool for puppy sales’ and lead to ‘irresponsible puppy sales’. The obvious fear is that unscrupulous breeders will step in. Responsible and compassionate breeders should never subject their young puppies to these environments if they aim for them to grow into confident and content adult dogs. I should make it clear, however, that puppy yoga is new to Ireland and there is no evidence of the involvement of any puppy farm animals. Regrettably, there are always irresponsible breeders who prioritise profit over the welfare of dogs, leading to numerous victims of illegal puppy farming each year. Last year, there was a record number of surrender requests, highlighting the urgency to stop supporting the unnecessary breeding of dogs. Puppy yoga only makes the breeding of pups that bit more attractive to those looking to make a quick buck. The answer is, “we don’t.” Instead, I would encourage anyone seeking positive interactions with puppies and dogs to volunteer with their local rescue centre, where teams work tirelessly to help animals in Ireland. There, you can walk a dog, transport a puppy, or simply lend a hand, knowing you’re aiding dogs rather than supporting puppy farmers and backyard breeders. While puppy yoga may appear harmless and enjoyable on the surface, a closer examination, particularly of experiences abroad, reveals numerous ethical, environmental and societal concerns. Yoga is a massively beneficial class to take in its own right, and there are some terrific studios offering amazing classes all around Ireland. I encourage you to do it for yourself without the need for an additional gimmick.",

        "content": "Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday said that Bharatiya Janata Party has nothing to show for the work they did in the last 10 years of their tenure, adding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is asking the public to vote for his party in the name of Gods and Goddesses. Addressing an election rally in Kangra, Priyanka Gandhi said, “The BJP tries to topple the elected government with its money power. MLAs were being lured with Rs 100 crore offers each. The Prime Minister of the country has the responsibility of maintaining democracy and building morality. PM Modi asks for votes in the name of Gods and Goddesses.” She further said that government is working to reduce the import tax on the apples being imported from America but here taxes are being increased on the fruit. “Adani is deciding the prices of apples. Taxes are being reduced for the apples coming from America but here it is being increased. BJP government only wants to remain in power in the name of religion for the last 10 years and is using money power extensively to stay in power,” Priyanka Gandhi said. Regarding the Lok Sabha elections, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said that in 2022, the people of Himachal Pradesh have elected a true and honest government. “Similarly, they should bring an honest government at the Center also”. Polling in all four seats in Himachal is scheduled for June 1. It will not only pit candidates vying for Lok Sabha membership from four seats but also elect members for six assembly seats that fell vacant following the resignation and switchover of dissident Congress lawmakers",

        "description": "Using some of the same technology found in America's Cup winning sailing vessels, marine tech company Vessev has launched a premium tourism electric hydrofoil ferry.",
        "content": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Vessev VS-9 electric hydrofoil. The 10-seater vessel is being tested and will go into commercial ... [+] service later this year through Fullers360 in New Zealand. Once an engineering program lead for the original Apple Watch, Eric Laakmann has morphed into a sort of ferry godfather, as CEO of marine tech company Vessev . With Laakman at the helm, The New Zealand-based company unveiled the VS-9, what it terms the “world’s first premium tourism electric hydrofoiling vessel,” on Monday. After an initial test period going on now out of Aukland, once certified later this year, Vessev expects the VS-9 to go into commercial service through Fullers360 , New Zealand’s largest ferry operator. “It’s our intention for Fullers360 to be 100% electric or hydrogen operated by 2040 and foiling is absolutely a part of that vision for us,” said Mike Horne, Fullers360 CEO, in a statement. The 29-foot long VS-9 can carry up to 10 passengers plus a skipper at a top speed of about 30 knots, or 34.5 miles per hour, with a cruising range of between 40-50 nautical miles, or 46-57 miles.

Unlike a conventional vessel floating on the water’s surface, a hydrofoil hovers just above the surface, typically providing a more comfortable ride since it’s not affected as much by pounding waves. In the case of the VS-9, the company touts construction of the actual foils as a key differentiator enhancing control and passenger comfort even further while improving energy consumption. The VS-9 uses what Vessev describes as ultra-high authority hydrofoil systems, where the foils change shape using high precision flaps under the water to optimize efficiency, based in part, on technology used in America’s Cup sailing vessels. Vessev worked with Fullers360 and the ferry operator’s “decarbonization” partner NetZeroMaritime to develop the VS-9. Eric Laakmann, CEO, marine technology company Vessev. “The ability to remove the foils from the water completely is a design element we’re particularly proud of. We were told it would be impractical, but we’ve delivered a system which makes it easy for operators to maintain pristine foils for maximum efficiency. To our knowledge, the VS 9 will be the only certified passenger electric hydrofoil in the world capable of this,” said Laakmann in a statement. The Vessev VS-9 is not the first electric hydrofoil to be used as a ferry. Tech startup Navier launched a hydrofoil transit program with financial platform company Stripe in ... [+] the San Francisco Bay Area to transport Stripe employees from Marin County to company headquarters in South San Francisco. This past March, San Francisco, Calif.-based startup Navier began providing a water taxi service using one of its high-speed electric, six-passenger, N30 hydrofoil boats to ferry employees of financial infrastructure platform company Stripe to and from Larkspur in Marin County to Oyster Point near the company’s South San Franciso headquarters, about 22 miles each way. The N30, however, is largely being marketed as a recreational vessel for private use. Acknowledging the fact there are what he termed a “handful” of recreational hydrofoiling electric vessels in the marketplace, Laakmann maintains in email responses to our questions, “there are no vessels of this type which have passed survey for use in commercial passenger applications. Laakmann bases Vassev’s claim to be the “first hydrofoiling tourism vessel to operate in the world” on both the VS-9’s features and the arrangement with Fullers360, explaining, “We will be the first in the world to certify a vessel of this type for passenger use in commercial applications (tourism and point to point marine services). The VS—9 will be the first electric hydrofoiling vessel to be operated in commercial service by a private operator (Fullers360).” Laakmann points out the VS-9 contains additional attributes for commercial use that include: · Full battery structural fire protection and safety systems. · Designs reviewed and approved by regulators (load cases, structural design, electric system, etc) · DNV-GL design standards. “Far more significant safety systems.” Several VS-9 have already been sold with a starting price of $620,000, according to Laakmann, declaring, “We are calling it the \"Rivian of the Sea,” referring to the U.S. brand of electric pickup trucks and SUVs. Vessev is now developing the 100-passenger capacity VS-18. Indeed, just as the auto industry is moving more towards electric vehicles to improve the environment and reduce fossil fuel consumption, the marine sector is following suit for certain boating segments, in particular, electric hydrofoils. “There are 33 million vessels in the world today with sustainable vessels representing the smallest fraction,” said Laakmann. “Through significant enhancements in efficiency, hydrofoiling will play a key role in this once-in-a-generation shift.” Editorial Standards Print Reprints & Permissions",

        "content": "Expressing concerns over his weight loss, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said that he filed a petition in the Supreme Court for the extension of his interim bail for seven more days as he might be facing some serious medical condition for which he needs time to get the medical tests done. The Supreme Court has granted interim bail to Arvind Kejriwal until June 1. Addressing a press conference in Bathinda, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said, “My weight has fallen a lot. If a person’s weight falls by 7 kg in a month without any reason, then it is a very serious problem. So the doctors have prescribed several tests. I have asked for 7 days so that I can get all my tests done within a week. There could be some serious disease going on inside. The doctors said that if all the tests are done, then at least we will know whether some serious disease is going on inside or not.” Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking an extension on medical grounds of his interim bail by seven days in connection with the alleged liquor policy, the Aam Aadmi Party said on Monday. Kejriwal was released from Delhi’s Tihar Jail on May 10, 50 days after he was jailed on corruption charges linked to the alleged liquor policy scam and hours after the Supreme Court granted him bail until June 1. According to the party, the Delhi Chief Minister has lost 7 kilograms weight after his arrest and his ketone level is high which could signal some serious disease.The party further informed that the doctors had advised the AAP convenor to undergo a Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography (PET-CT) scan and some other medical tests due to which Kejriwal has sought the extension of his interim bail. After being released from jail, Kejriwal has been engaged in campaigning for the INDIA bloc for the ongoing Lok Sabha polls. Kejriwal was arrested by the Directorate of Enforcement in an excise policy case on March 21, days after the election schedule for the general elections was announced. The bail is applicable until June 1 and Kejriwal has to surrender to authorities on June 2. Arvind Kejriwal also accused Union Home Minister Amit Shah of threatening to topple the AAP government in Punjab after the Lok Sabha polls. “People of Punjab want to ask Amit Shah, what are your plans? We have 92 MLAs out of 117 whereas you have only 3. Will you send ED and CBI and try to bribe the people of Punjab? I want to tell the people of Punjab that if you want to receive free electricity then give all 13 seats to AAP,” he said. Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday targeted the Aam Aadmi Party for not living up to the promises assured to Punjab and criticised Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for making the state a hub of corruption. Slamming the government of AAP, Amit Shah claimed that AAP is a government that is known for breaking promises. “This is the government of the AAP party, it is a government which breaks promises. Rs 1000 were not given to every mother and sister, Punjab was not made drug-free in a month, and 16 medical colleges were not opened up in the state,” Shah said. Punjab is witnessing a four-corner fight in the state. In Punjab, voting for its 13 seats will take place in a single phase, with the seventh and final phase on June 1 seeing voting in Gurudaspur, Amritsar, Khadoor Sahib, Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Nandpur Sahib, Ludhiana, Fatehgarh Sahib, Faridkot, Firozpur, Bathinda, Sangrur, and Patiala constituencies",

        "content": "Tom Brady is ready to kick off summer. On Monday, the retired NFL star shared a video on Instagram featuring him enjoying some splashy good times with two of his kids, Benjamin, 14, and Vivian, 11 , whom he shares with his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen. “You guys okay if we get summer started? Hope everyone is having a great MDW!☀️🇺🇸🏄‍♂️,” he captioned the clip, which was overlapped with Post Malone and Morgan Wallen’s “I Had Some Help.” In it, the 46-year-old showed off his buff physique while driving a speedboat, jet-skiing and wakeboarding. His kids also joined in on the fun as they went tubing. The outing comes on the heels of Brady’s Netflix roast that poked fun at his personal life. The Super Bowl champ — who also has a son, Jack, 16 , with ex-Bridget Moynahan — admitted he “didn’t like” how his kids were “affected” by jokes made about his exes. “I loved when the jokes were about me,” he shared on “The Pivot” podcast. “I thought they were so fun. I didn’t like the way that affected my kids.” Brady shared that he initially signed up for the roast because he didn’t mind jokes being made at his expense but confessed he hadn’t thought the decision through. “It’s the hardest part about like, the bittersweet aspect of when you do something that you think is one way and then all of a sudden you realize, ‘I wouldn’t do that again,’ because of the way that affected actually the people that I care about the most in the world,” he explained. “So it makes you in some ways a better parent going through it because sometimes you’re naive you don’t know or you get a little like, ‘Oh s–t!’” During the roast, comedian Nikki Glaser made fun of Brady for breaking up with Moynihan while she was pregnant with their son. And Kevin Hart teased the Patriots player about his ex-wife, Bündchen, and her new romance with her jiu-jitsu trainer, Joaquim Valente. Start your day with Page Six Daily.

Page Six exclusively reported that the Brazilian model, 43, felt hurt because Brady “once again put football before his family” during his comedy roast. And, Moynahan, 53, shared cryptic messages on social media about being “kind” and “loyal.” Glaser then clapped back at Brady’s comments , saying it’s “impossible” he didn’t know what would happen during the roast. “I also think Tom Brady does not do anything without doing his research and knowing exactly what he’s getting into,” Glaser, 39, claimed on the “Today” show. Following the drama, Brady paid tribute to the “Blue Bloods” actress, Bündchen and his mom in a sweet Mother’s Day post . “Happy Mothers Day to these kind, caring, compassionate and POWERFUL moms that I’m lucky to have in my life. None of this would be possible without your love ❤️❤️❤️,” he captioned the post.",

        "content": "LAGU Garuda Pancasila merupakan salah satu lagu yang dikumandangkan dalam perayaan Hari Lahir yang jatuh pada 1 Juni. Selain itu, lagu Garuda Pancasila sering kali dinyanyikan di upacara pengibaran bendera. Garuda Pancasila diciptakan oleh Prohar Sudharnoto yang saat itu merupakan kepala seksi musik di RRI pada 1956. Sebelumnya lagu itu diberi judul Mars Pancasila lalu diganti dengan Garuda Pancasila untuk menggambarkan lambang Pancasila, yaitu burung garuda. Lagu Garuda Pancasila diciptakan untuk menggambarkan Pancasila dalam bentuk seni dengan menumbuhkan rasa cinta Tanah Air dan semangat persatuan melalui lagu. Ini karena lagu merupakan bahasa universal, bahasa rakyat. Saat itu masyarakat tidak akan bisa menyatakan Pancasila dengan terang terangan pada saat upacara. Kehadiran lagu Garuda Pancasila bisa menanamkan dasar negara di hati rakyat dengan media yang disukai oleh seluruh orang. (OL-14)",

        "content": "Three adorable peregrine falcon chicks hatched this month in a purpose-built nest atop the nearly 700-foot-tall tower of the Verrazzano Narrows Bridge. The three chicks hatched in early May in a special box containing their nest atop the Brooklyn tower of the Verrazzano, said the MTA, which administers the bridge. The box was purpose-built for the peregrine falcon, which is the fastest animal in the world, capable of flying at 200 miles per hour while hunting for prey. Peregrine falcons were nearly wiped out in New York in the 1960s owing to the widespread use of deadly pesticides like DDT, which infected their food supply. In the 70s and 80s, the state released captive falcons into the wild, hoping they would breed and restore the species, which is still listed as endangered. The chicks are banded for research and safety purposes but otherwise are left alone. Marc A. Hermann / MTA Marc A. Hermann / MTA DEP scientist Chris Nadareski climbs the Verrazzano each year to band the chicks. Marc A. Hermann / MTA Falcons prefer building their nests in high places, like atop bridges or skyscrapers, but they do not build secure stick nests for their young like other birds, so the eggs are in danger of falling. As such, state agencies have built boxes filled with gravel in popular nesting areas atop bridges and in other high perches, aimed at keeping the falcon young safe at the most vulnerable time of their lives. Aside from the Verrazzano, falcon nests sit atop the Marine Parkway-Gil Hodges Bridge and on every crossing of the Hudson River south of Albany. On May 24, Department of Environmental Protection scientist Chris Nadareski climbed to the top of the Brooklyn tower to affix identifying bands on the birds, for research purposes and to monitor for sickness or injury. Nadareski returns to the site each year for banding, as peregrine falcons tend to lay their eggs in the same nesting spot over and over. Other than banding, the state generally leaves the birds alone. Peregrine falcons like to build their nests on high perches, like atop bridges or skyscrapers. Marc A. Hermann / MTA Peregrine falcons are the world’s fastest animal, capable of flying at 200 miles per hour. Marc A. Hermann / MTA Peregrine falcons predominantly feast on a diet of smaller birds like pigeons, which are (obviously) in plentiful supply in New York. As of 2019, there were 25 breeding pairs of peregrine falcons living in the city, which according to state officials may be the largest number of falcons in any city on Earth.",

        "description": "The Tineco Floor One Stretch S6 is a smart wet-dry vacuum that includes some revolutionary features you're going to want to know about! Here's why.",
        "content": "Tineco A huge challenge with cleaning your home and living spaces is that the tools you use, like a vacuum, don’t always stretch or reach everywhere you want to go. For example, under a couch or a reclining chair, where dust and debris might have built up over time. The Tineco Floor One Stretch S6 changes all of that. For starters, it has a 5.1-inch compact design, making it super low-profile. But it also lays flat, up to 180 degrees, so you can get under those hard-to-reach spaces. It’s a marvelous piece of machinery that can take your cleaning to a whole new level. Of course, there’s so much more it has to offer, so we thought it best to call out the top features for you. Contents 1. 180-degree lay-lat design 2. Two-stage self-cleaning system 3. Triple-sided edge cleaning 4. Wet-dry vacuum with three-chamber dirty water separation 5. Long-lasting runtime 6. Lightweight and maneuverable design 7. Five-minute air drying 8. The price is right Show 3 more items 1. 180-degree lay-lat design Tineco With a height of just 5.1 inches and its 180-degree lay-flat design, the vacuum is easy to reach under furniture or small spaces. Just recline it and slide it under—it’s that simple. You’ll learn a little later, but its intelligent, lightweight design makes it easy to maneuver, too, so you’ll never be fighting against the vacuum to do the work. 2. Two-stage self-cleaning system When you’re all done vacuuming and mopping, the Floor One Stretch S6 utilizes a two-stage self-cleaning process. First, it flushes the necessary components with fresh hot water, and then it undergoes a five-minute flash dry, using hot air to dry the brush roll and damp components. Keeping the system dry also helps prevent mold and mildew build-up, so it’s clean and ready to freshen up your floors every time you use it. 3. Triple-sided edge cleaning Tineco With most vacuums, the size makes it tough to get right up below baseboards, into corners, and other tight edges. The Floor One Stretch S6, on the other hand, offers what’s called Triple-Sided Edge Cleaning. It reaches 0.20 inches away from walls and corners, meaning you can get right up in there and get all the dust and debris once and for all. 4. Wet-dry vacuum with three-chamber dirty water separation Generally, wet and dry vacuums are a pain to manage. Keeping the fresh water filled and the dirty water cleaned is quite the hassle. That’s not so with the Floor One Stretch S6, thanks to a three-chamber water system that separates the dirty and freshwater tanks. More importantly, it also separates solids, liquids, and air to better protect the motor and maintain full cleaning power no matter how long you’re using it. Plus, the 0.72-liter large-capacity water tank holds enough fresh water to clean most, if not all, of your home in one go. 5. Long-lasting runtime Speaking of cleaning your whole home in one go, the large-capacity rechargeable battery lasts for up to 40 minutes on a single charge. That’s plenty of time to clean even large homes and get into all the nooks and crannies that need freshening up. You can cover both all the visible floors and spaces in your home, and the hidden corners and spaces in one session. That’s the kind of reliability and support that makes cleaning so much easier. 6. Lightweight and maneuverable design Tineco In combination with the lay-flat design and low profile, the Floor One Stretch S6 also incorporates mini assist wheels that help the vacuum glide effortlessly with minimal work from you and a repositioned water tank. That tank is now seated above the brush head, rebalancing the weight of the vacuum and making it more maneuverable and lightweight overall. Even with a full freshwater tank, it’s not too heavy to push, pull, or glide over your floors and throughout your living spaces. 7. Five-minute air drying The self-cleaning features keep you hands-free even after all the main cleaning is done, with a two-stage hot water wash and flash dry, plus 720-degree bi-directional brush rotation — which rotates the brush forward and backward to deep clean the brush roll. But the real star of the show here is the flash drying. In just five minutes, the wet brush and all the related components are dry again. That prevents mold, mildew, and nasty odors from building up over time, but it also helps to ensure that no matter how many times you take out the vacuum and clean it, it’s always ready to deliver a fresh, spotless experience. 8. The price is right Tineco Normally, vacuums of this caliber with advanced technology are expensive, so much so that they’re inaccessible unless you have money to burn. The Floor One Stretch S6 is priced reasonably, and in many cases, it’s one of the best features overall. The standard price is $599, and if you’re able to capitalize on a deal, it’s even better.",

        "content": "Kolkata (West Bengal) [India], March 27 (ANI): Announcing she would skip the INDIA bloc meeting scheduled to be held on June 1, Trinamool Congress Chairperson and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee stressed that providing relief to the people of the state after the cyclone Remal is her foremost priority along with the seventh phase of Lok Sabha elections. Banerjee said, \"The INDIA team is holding a meeting on June 1. I have told them I can't join as we have an election on 10 seats in West Bengal on the same day. Punjab, Bihar and UP also have elections on June 1. On one side is the cyclone, and on the other side, it is elections - I have to do everything. Cyclone relief is my priority right now.\" She said that her priority was to provide relief to the victims and take care of them. \"My priority is to take care of the victims, provide shelter to them and help them. I am speaking here but my focus is on the relief work. This is an emotive issue,\" she added. She further hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and alleged that being a Prime Minister of the country he was advertising at his public rallies which is setting a wrong precedent. \"Tomorrow PM Modi will conduct a rally in Kolkata. I don't have any objection but PM will do a rally after advertising and use party symbol, is that correct? He can tell that he is doing it as BJP leader and not as Prime Minister. He said that he has given gas connections free of cost but is it true? Did he give Rs 15 lakh in every account? Did he bring back the black money? Even an ITI student is not getting a job,\" she further added. Earlier Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit had confirmed that the INDIA bloc has called for an all-party meeting on June 1, ahead of the declaration of Lok Sabha results on June 4. West Bengal is voting in all the seven phases of the Lok Sabha polls with the last phase scheduled on Saturday. The counting of votes is on June 4. (ANI)",

        "description": "Imperatriz could go for an estimated price of between A$4 million and A$7 million.",
        "content": "Champion New Zealand mare Imperatriz may not be allowed to go to her own public auction on the Gold Coast today but will be allowed to watch. The 10-time Group 1 winner will be offered for sale at the Magic Millions sale around 6.30pm (NZ time), with an estimated price expected of between A$4 million and A$7 million. Imperatriz was retired in April after a stunning 15-month burst in which she developed into one of the world’s best sprinters, dominating Victorian sprinting like no New Zealand speedster ever before her. Her post-campaign veterinary examination showed signs of wear and tear, and while she could race again, Te Akau racing boss David Ellis decided to call time on a career that needed no more embellishment. Being a syndicate-owned mare, Imperatriz was going to have to be sold at a public auction to establish the market price for her owners, but today’s offering comes with a twist, as Imperatriz won’t be on the Gold Coast. She will instead be in her home paddock in Waikato, where she has been visited by most prospective buyers in recent weeks, with the appropriate veterinary due diligence undertaken. “We’ve had a lot of people to the farm to look at her, so while we will be over here, she will be in her usual paddock back home,” said Ellis from the Gold Coast last night. But that doesn’t mean Imperatriz will miss out on the historic remote sale and the huge numbers being thrown around 2300km away. “We have a young lady who looks after her named Faith Pollock who is going to go down and give her a cuddle around the time she is being sold,” Ellis told the Herald. “She’s going to take her iPad, too, and let Imperatriz watch the sale so she can see what all the fuss is about,” said the Te Akau boss with a laugh. While Imperatriz may care more about the cuddles than the cash, many in the racing industry can’t wait to see who pays what to secure the superstar speedster. “I’m thinking somewhere between A$4m and A$6m,” Ellis said. “But as everybody who goes to horse sales knows, it only takes two people determined to buy the same horse and things can change quite quickly.” While any thoroughbred breeder who would love to buy Imperatriz to breed from, or even race again, the reality is there are only a handful thought to be in the market. The major Australian breeding operations such as Yulong and Coolmore are obvious potential buyers who have previously paid huge money for trophy mares. North American newbie John Stewart has been spending and tweeting up big in the past six months and has said he would consider paying A$6m for Imperatriz and then even putting her back in work if she was deemed sound and healthy enough. Japanese breeders led by the Shadai Group, who own the giant Northern Farms operation, have dabbled successfully at the top end of the Australasian broodmare market, so are another massive player who could buy Imperatriz without surprising. Yulong would be favourite in any potential buyer market but they already own Imperatriz’s dam Berimbau, as well as a weanling full brother to Imperatriz (I Am Invincible), paying A$1.8m for the pair in Sydney last year. Whether that increases their appetite to own the great mare, or they think they have that bloodline covered could be a key price driver. Those who want to join Imperatriz in watching her sale live can do so via the Magic Millions website. Selling the champ ●Champion New Zealand mare Imperatriz will be offered for sale at public auction on the Gold Coast today. ●She won’t be at the Magic Millions sale complex as she is stayed in New Zealand. ●Educated industry estimates range from A$4 million to A$7 million for Imperatriz, who is likely to be put on foal rather than race again. ●The sale should be around 6.30pm (NZ time).

        "content": "300 exhibitors from five continents will be taking part in this year’s Food & Beverage West Africa International Trade Exhibition, the largest edition yet. More than 300 exhibitors representing brands and businesses from more than 50 countries will be on show from June 11 to 13, 2024 at the Landmark Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos. Nine countries will have exhibitor pavilions – Turkey, Dubai, China, India, USA, Indonesia, Italy, Egypt, and Tunisia. In addition, sizeable delegations from UAE, UK, Thailand, Ukraine, Ghana, Algeria, Malaysia, Netherlands, and many more will use the show to launch new products into Nigeria and West Africa as well as to meet new business partners. Now in its fifth edition, Food & Beverage West Africa is the continent’s largest food and beverage trade show. More than 6,000 visitors are expected to attend over the three days. The exhibition is organised by BtoB Events. Exhibition Manager, Brad Smith, said: “This year’s exhibition is featuring more exhibitors, more countries, and more products than ever. If you are seeking new and exciting products that have yet to be seen in the West African market, then FAB is simply unmissable. “FAB 2024 is bringing even more countries and exhibitors than ever before. Our brand-new USA, China and Italy pavilions are joining our regular pavilions from Turkey, Dubai, India, Indonesia and Egypt. We are also welcoming exhibitors for the first time from countries such as Mexico, Korea, Hong Kong, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Iran, Libya, Turkmenistan, and Nepal.” The event is recognised for the number and range of overseas exhibitors, which attract visitors from the West African region and beyond. “We pride ourselves on the international standard quality that our exhibition represents. It is a unique exhibition where we are bringing the global food and beverage industry to Nigeria, with both exhibitors and visitors attending and all looking to do business within the West African region,” said Mr. Smith. One of the international exhibitors, Xena’s Food Group is a Platinum Sponsor of FAB West Africa. Based in London, Xena’s is a wholesale food distributor specialising in premium-grade fresh condiments, oils, and ingredients. The company sees huge potential with the Nigerian market, noting the growing demand here for high-quality ingredients. “FAB West Africa offers a unique opportunity to connect with key players in the food industry specifically within the West African region,” said Mr Kochhar, Head of International Trade. “We believe that this targeted approach aligns perfectly with our goal of expanding our presence in Nigeria and neighbouring countries. We see this event as a strategic platform to showcase our offerings. “Our primary objective is to establish Xena’s Food Group as a trusted supplier of premium food products in the African market. We aim to forge partnerships with distributors, wholesalers, hotels, and restaurants, showcasing our extensive range of high-quality mayonnaises, ketchups, flours, cooking oils, poultry, eggs, and grains.” Another of the international exhibitors is Linc Drinks, also from London, and a manufacturer of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Zoryana Slater, Linc Drinks’ Export Manager, is delighted to be coming to Food & Beverage West Africa. “We recognize the immense potential of the African market, particularly Nigeria, and view FAB West Africa as a strategic platform to showcase our premium beverages. We aim to establish strong connections with industry stakeholders, distributors, and consumers, fostering brand recognition and market penetration. “We aim to forge strategic partnerships, secure distribution channels, and generate substantial interest in our products, including our private label options,” said Zoryana Slater.",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal has all but ruled himself out of competing at Wimbledon next month. The 37-year-old Spaniard bid an emotional au revoir to the French Open on Monday after losing in the first round to Alexander Zverev. Nadal, a 14-time winner at Roland Garros, plans to be back in Paris for this summer’s Olympic Games and has not entirely ruled out a return next year. But he believes the quick turnaround from clay to grass and back again means he is almost certain not to return to the scene of his 2008 and 2010 Wimbledon triumphs. “It looks difficult, honestly,” he said. “For me now I can’t confirm what’s going on, but it looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay. “So I cannot confirm anything. I need to talk with team. I need to analyse so many facts. “But I don’t think it’s going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay. “Today I feel that’s not a good idea, but I can’t confirm. But my feeling is even if I am booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don’t think it’s a positive idea right now.” Unseeded after his long injury absence and still way below the peak of his powers, Nadal was unfortunate to run into the in-form world number four Zverev in the opening round at Roland Garros. But Nadal gave the 27-year-old, 10 years his junior and a favourite for the title, a serious match before going down 6-3 7-6 (5) 6-3 in front of an adoring and emotional Philippe Chatrier crowd. The Spaniard had told tournament organisers last week that he did not want a farewell ceremony as he would not “close the door” on a return to the Paris showpiece. 🫶🧡 pic.twitter.com/7DApnv0rxD — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) May 27, 2024 It seemed no one had got the memo, though. The seats behind the players’ boxes were crammed with current stars including Carlos Alcaraz – Nadal’s heir apparent – long-time rival Novak Djokovic and women’s number one and three-time champion Iga Swiatek. Nadal added: “I didn’t see them, but I think in some way it’s normal, no? I think if that’s the last time that I’m gonna be playing here and if I know that Novak is the last time playing in Wimbledon or in Australia and I was there, it’s normal. “I mean, happy that that happens, you know, because that means that I had a positive legacy here and positive legacy my career.” Also in attendance were Nadal’s wife Xisca, who rarely watches his matches, baby son Rafael Jr and uncles Toni – his former coach – and Miguel Angel, the ex-Spain footballer.

But a slow start had cost Nadal a break in the opening game which he never retrieved, while Zverev was too strong in the tie-break and held his nerve down the final straight. So Nadal’s astonishing Roland Garros record now reads played 116, won 112, as Zverev added his name to Djokovic and Robin Soderling as the only players to beat him here. Zverev, a gracious winner having left the same court in a wheelchair two years ago after hurting his ankle in his semi-final against Nadal, said: “Thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world. Today is not my moment, it is Rafa’s moment.”",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal has all but ruled himself out of competing at Wimbledon next month. The 37-year-old Spaniard bid an emotional au revoir to the French Open on Monday after losing in the first round to Alexander Zverev. Nadal, a 14-time winner at Roland Garros, plans to be back in Paris for this summer’s Olympic Games and has not entirely ruled out a return next year. But he believes the quick turnaround from clay to grass and back again means he is almost certain not to return to the scene of his 2008 and 2010 Wimbledon triumphs. “It looks difficult, honestly,” he said. “For me now I can’t confirm what’s going on, but it looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay. “So I cannot confirm anything. I need to talk with team. I need to analyse so many facts. “But I don’t think it’s going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay. “Today I feel that’s not a good idea, but I can’t confirm. But my feeling is even if I am booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don’t think it’s a positive idea right now.” Unseeded after his long injury absence and still way below the peak of his powers, Nadal was unfortunate to run into the in-form world number four Zverev in the opening round at Roland Garros. But Nadal gave the 27-year-old, 10 years his junior and a favourite for the title, a serious match before going down 6-3 7-6 (5) 6-3 in front of an adoring and emotional Philippe Chatrier crowd. The Spaniard had told tournament organisers last week that he did not want a farewell ceremony as he would not “close the door” on a return to the Paris showpiece. 🫶🧡 — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) It seemed no one had got the memo, though. The seats behind the players’ boxes were crammed with current stars including Carlos Alcaraz – Nadal’s heir apparent – long-time rival Novak Djokovic and women’s number one and three-time champion Iga Swiatek. Nadal added: “I didn’t see them, but I think in some way it’s normal, no? I think if that’s the last time that I’m gonna be playing here and if I know that Novak is the last time playing in Wimbledon or in Australia and I was there, it’s normal. “I mean, happy that that happens, you know, because that means that I had a positive legacy here and positive legacy my career.” Also in attendance were Nadal’s wife Xisca, who rarely watches his matches, baby son Rafael Jr and uncles Toni – his former coach – and Miguel Angel, the ex-Spain footballer.

        "content": "Belfast-based shipyard Harland & Wolff warned that the company might not survive if a £200 million (€233.09 million) loan guarantee from the government failed to materialise owing to state aid rules. This could put at risk a £1.6 billion (€1.86 billion) contract to build Royal Fleet Auxiliary support ships. Brussels asked the Spanish government for proof that it had introduced effective systems to prevent China’s Huawei accessing the 5G network. This was one of the reforms and conditions that Madrid had to comply with by 2022 in order to receive a fourth payment of European Union funds worth €10 billion. Cambridge-based Raspberry Pi, whose low-cost computers help children to learn about IT, has sold 60 million units worldwide since 2012 and now intends to list on the London stock market. The business could be valued at £500 million (€582.72 million) the Sunday Times said on initially reporting the float. Most Read on Euro Weekly News Construction and infrastructure group ACS posted a first-quarter net profit of €177 million, an 8.4 per cent increase on 2023. The firm headed by Real Madrid president Florentino Perez had a turnover of €8.70 billion during this period, prompting a “minimum” net profit forecast of €600 million for the entire year. Boots’ US owner Walgreens Boots Alliance is increasing efforts to find a buyer for the British pharmacy chain and working with experts to establish discussions with likely firms, according to Bloomberg reports. Insiders said that Walgreens would want £7 billion (€8.16 billion) for the 174-year-old company. Brussels increased its 2024 growth prediction for Spain to 2.1 per cent thanks to domestic demand and a strong labour market, Economy commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said. Implementing the Recovery and Resilience Plan (RRP) would underpin investment growth, he added. Archie Norman, Marks & Spencer chairman, maintained that police had little interest in dealing with shoplifters and many store thefts were never solved. Retailers had to spend “a lot of money” on tackling the problem and although shoplifting in M&S stores had been reduced, this was mainly due to measures the retailer had introduced, Norman told LBC Radio. A recent survey by economic think-tank Fedea found that 83.7 per cent of employees working in Spain’s hospitality industry were overqualified for their jobs, compared with 68 per cent in other European countries. Fedea also found that 76.6 per cent of Spain’s agricultural workers and 73.1 per cent employed in logistics were also overqualified. Former UK Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi, who announced he would not run as a Tory MP in the next election, was named chairman of Very Group, owned by the Barclay family. Expected to take over on June 1, he will be replacing. Aidan Barclay. Thank you for taking the time to read this article.

The music star, who is known for the songs Starships, Super Bass and Anaconda, livestreamed her arrest on social media and claimed drugs found in her luggage did not belong to her.

        "content": "Nicki Minaj has released a new date to perform at the Co-op Live arena in Manchester. The rapper and singer, 41, had to be reschedule the gig after her arrest in the Netherlands on Saturday. “OK guys, I was JUST RE-ADVISED that we actually CAN NOT do any other date for the make up #gagcityMANCHESTER date besides JUNE 3rd,” she said on X. “So JUNE 3rd is the new official date for all ticket holders who originally had tickets to the MAY 25th #Manchester show. OK guys, I was JUST RE-ADVISED that we actually CAN NOT do any other date for the make up date besides JUNE 3rd.

I apologize for all the... — Nicki Minaj (@NICKIMINAJ) “I apologise for all the inconvenience this has caused. I really hope you can make the #JUNE3rd show. It’ll be really special. Ticketmaster will contact you to advise officially.” Minaj said she spent around six hours in custody at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport on Saturday before being able to fly to the UK. Fans were let into the newly-opened Manchester venue at around 7pm on Saturday for her show, before promoter Live Nation announced at around 9.40pm that it was to be postponed. Dutch police said a woman aged 41 was arrested on Saturday after allegedly trying to take what it described as “soft drugs” from Schiphol Airport to another country. A later update from the force said it had released the “suspect and she can now move on” after paying a fine. It marked the latest postponed gig at the Co-op Live arena which has been plagued with issues since trying to open in April. Minaj had praised fans for being a “class act” during the last-minute postponement, and invited them to her hotel in the centre of Manchester before speaking to the crowds outside. The music star, who is known for the songs Starships, Super Bass and Anaconda, livestreamed her arrest on social media and claimed drugs found in her luggage did not belong to her. She performed at Birmingham’s Resorts World Arena on Sunday.",

        "description": "Your first sexual experience can shape your emotions and attitudes around sex and self-image throughout your life.",
        "content": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Your first sexual experience can shape your emotions and attitudes around sex and self-image ... [+] throughout your life. A person’s first sexual experience is often regarded as a significant milestone in their lives. It is an event loaded with emotional, social and psychological weight. Research shows that it is highly common to have mixed or conflicting emotions about this experience, including happiness, fear and indifference. The reverberations of your first time can be felt for years after, influencing self-esteem, relationship dynamics and sexual and psychological well-being. Adding to this complexity are the various perceptions of “virginity”—as a gift, a rite of passage or even a burden— that deeply affect how people feel about their first time. Here are two primary ways your “first time” can affect you years later, according to research. 1. Feelings About The Event Impact Long-Term Well-Being A positive first sexual experience—characterized by mutual and enthusiastic consent, emotional intimacy, respect and emotional readiness—can foster positive emotions and a healthy sexual identity. In contrast, research shows that negative experiences, such as those involving regret, coercion, emotional unpreparedness, peer pressure and drug or alcohol use can lead to poorer psychological and physical health outcomes in adulthood and long-lasting feelings of guilt, shame, anxiety and sexual difficulties . Apple Brings Back iPhone 14 Pro For First Time—At Lower Price, Refurbished The Birkenstock Memorial Day Sale Features Styles For Over 50 Off The 82 Best Memorial Day Sales To Shop Now Before They re Gone Such experiences can also fuel beliefs that sex is inherently shameful or dangerous, which can impede healthy sexual development and future relationships. Additionally, a 2022 study published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior found that consenting but just “going along with it” in a first-time sexual experience, without feeling much desire for it, can become a life stressor and lead to greater psychological distress and poorer physical health outcomes in later life, even post-retirement. Importantly, the most positive first-time encounters involve having the agency to form your own definition and context of what pleasure means to you and engaging in sex only when it is something you completely desire throughout the process. Research also shows that women are less likely to have a highly satisfying first-time experience compared to men, as they are comparatively less likely to achieve orgasm . However, being in a committed relationship with one’s sexual partner enhances psychological satisfaction for both partners, highlighting the importance of feeling safe and connected to each other. Socio-cultural norms also play a crucial role in shaping an individual’s perception of their first time. In societies where virginity is heavily stigmatized or highly valued, there can be immense pressure surrounding this event. The fear of judgment or shame associated with losing virginity outside of culturally accepted contexts can also exacerbate long-term psychological distress. 2. Your First Time Influences Your Future Sexual Identity Research shows that the average American loses their virginity at about 17 years old. Researchers found that this initial experience influences one’s “sexual self-efficacy,” which in turn affects one’s current level of sexual adjustment. Sexual self-efficacy refers to an individual’s confidence in their ability to make their own decisions about their sexuality, practice safe sex, initiate sexual activity, communicate sexual needs, desires, boundaries and preferences with a partner as well as advance and navigate sexual relationships. Adolescence and early adulthood are critical periods for cognitive and identity development. One’s first sexual experience often coincides with these developmental stages and consequently shapes sexual identity and cognitive schemas about sex and relationships. A positive or negative first experience can influence how individuals perceive themselves as sexual beings and how they approach future sexual encounters. Research shows that positive first-time experiences can lead to greater levels of sexual satisfaction and lower sexual depression years later, in one’s current sexual interactions. Additionally, the disparity between societal or personal expectations and the reality of the first sexual experience can also have long-term psychological effects. Unrealistic expectations around sex, often fueled by media portrayals, can lead to disappointment, disillusionment and a sense of inadequacy, affecting sexual satisfaction and confidence in the years that follow. A 2021 study also found that if men believe they have not lost their virginity at an appropriate age, they tend to have more negative experiences and face sexual performance anxiety, lowering their sexual self-efficacy in the long run. Further, a 2016 study found that being a sexual “late bloomer” or engaging in sex for the first time after most of one’s similarly aged peers already have, can impact future romantic relationships. “We observed that sexually inexperienced adults perceived themselves to be stigmatized due to their inexperience and were not highly desired as relationship partners. Even sexually inexperienced adults themselves did not find other inexperienced adults to be attractive relationship partners,” the researchers explain. However, it is essential to remember that there is no “right time” to have this experience and it is best to follow what aligns with your own needs and values. Reflecting on your first sexual experience, regardless of when it happened, can provide important context for understanding how you feel about yourself and your relationships today. If it did not occur as you envisioned or desired, it is possible and essential to heal and redefine what sexual experiences mean to you on your own terms. The importance of safety, consent and readiness in any sexual experience cannot be overstated. Encouraging younger people to recognize the importance of positive initial sexual experiences is also crucial. Comprehensive sex education can enhance sexual self-efficacy by providing accurate information about sexual health, safe practices and communication strategies for the generations that follow, allowing us as a society to feel empowered in our sexual identities and establish more fulfilling relationships with ourselves and others. Understanding attitudes towards sex is an important aspect of self-awareness.

        "content": "Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday both have interesting summers ahead, with the Blades needing to overhaul their squad, while the Owls will want to strengthen to avoid any kind of relegation battle next season. With Danny Rohl signed up to a new contract, Wednesday fans will be excited about next season, but Blades fans will want to see some of those much-needed changes to their squad before they can look to next season with true excitement. In the meantime, we have rounded up all the latest news surrounding the Steel City clubs. Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with a Digital Subscription to The Star, you can get unlimited access to the website including our premium content, as well as benefiting from fewer ads, loyalty rewards and much more. Former Leeds United star Luke Ayling has completed his move to Middlesbrough after a successful loan spell. The full-back was loaned out by Leeds during the January transfer window, and with his contract at Elland Road this summer, that was always going to prove a goodbye as far as he and Leeds were concerned. He was a regular for Boro in the second half of the season, and he has now penned a permanent two-year deal to remain on Teesside. “We’re delighted that Luke is staying with us,” Boro manager Michael Carrick said of the deal. “After coming in on loan in January, he settled in very quickly and made a big impact, bringing his character and personality to the group. He knows what it takes to be a success in this league. The club has got under his skin and the supporters have really taken to him as well, so it’s great to have him on board permanently.” Finance expert Kieran Maguire has claimed Leeds will have to settle a historic transfer fee bill before they can spend money on new players. He wrote last April: “Leeds owe other clubs a Jesus, Mary, Joseph and the wee donkey £190m in transfer fee instalments on player purchases but only due to receive £2m on player sales. Outstanding transfer fee creditors of £190m mean that Leeds will have to pay for old player acquisitions before they can spend this summer.” Leeds have a number of players out on loan, most of which they will look to sell, and it will be a case of assessing the bill they have left after they sell the players they no longer want, and indeed can no longer afford to keep. Advertisement Advertisement Sheffield Wednesday have reignited their interest in highly-rated Arsenal youngster Mika Biereth as their summer plans begin to take shape, The Star understands . The London-born Danish youth international was a January target for the Owls, who ultimately lost out to Austrian outfit Sturm Graz - his planned season-long loan with Motherwell was cut short by the Gunners as they sought to offer the striker a different experience. It is understood that Wednesday had at one stage had confidence they would claim the January signing of Biereth. A very successful stint in Austria only appears to have strengthened the Owls’ interest in the Arsenal prospect, who scored nine times and claimed four assists in his 22 appearances for Sturm Graz. A run of three goals in four matches in the Europa Conference League proved a highlight alongside their post-season run to the Austrian Bundesliga Championship. Biereth also won the Austrian Cup in his time there. Biereth started every game for the Austrian side and with the prospect of Champions League football to contend with, it is understood they will once again seek to bring him back on loan for next season in competition with Wednesday and a host of other clubs in the UK and in Europe.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON ( ) — When a Purple Heart recipient named Pat reached out to U.S. Sen. Patty Murray in November to inform her that he couldn’t transfer his GI bill benefits to his children, he wasn’t expecting congressional action to solve the problem. He simply just wanted to let the Washington state Democrat know, he told States Newsroom in an exclusive interview. With a child about to head to college, Pat, who didn’t want his last name used, had recently been told by the Army that he couldn’t transfer his education benefits to them because he received the Purple Heart after he was medically discharged. This rule does not apply to those who receive the medal while still in service. Murray and Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, introduced a bipartisan bill Thursday aimed at closing that loophole. The legislation, titled the , would permit retroactive award recipients who served on or after Sept. 11, 2001, to transfer their education benefits to one or more dependents. It was unveiled just ahead of Memorial Day, when the nation honors its deceased service members. “As the daughter of a Purple Heart recipient, I’ve seen firsthand the enormous sacrifices Purple Heart veterans make to defend our freedoms, and I feel strongly that we should be doing absolutely everything we can to help all veterans and their families thrive,” Murray said in a statement Thursday. “It doesn’t make any sense that service members who are awarded a Purple Heart after their service can’t transfer their GI benefits to their dependents, while those who receive it during their service can — and I am grateful to Pat, my constituent in Washington state who brought this gap in the law to my attention,” continued Murray, a senior member of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs. “Our legislation will close this loophole and allow more children of Purple Heart veterans to further their education. I want to thank Sen. Tillis for joining me on this legislation, and I’ll be working hard to get it passed into law.” Pat was medically discharged from the U.S. Army and retroactively received a Purple Heart for his actions during Iran’s retaliatory missile barrage in January 2020 on an Iraq airbase, after a U.S. drone strike killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani. The Army later approved 39 Purple Hearts for service members who experienced the attack, to a December 2021 report by the Army Times. As his teenager looks to enroll at Central Washington University next year, Pat found out that by law his education benefits would only be available for transfer if he had received the award while still in service. “My thought was, ‘I doubt that legislators would have done that intentionally.’ I just thought, you know, people probably just didn’t think about how that happens — that some people are going to get retroactive Purple Hearts, or for whatever reason in evaluating them, they’re delayed. So it’s not like an unusual thing,” Pat said in a phone interview. “I wasn’t thinking much was going to happen, but I just wanted to write Sen. Murray, who is my local senator, and let her know the issue. They responded by saying, ‘That’s an oversight on our part, and we want to make good on that.’” Pat said he’s “grateful for Sen. Murray” and hopes his action is able to help other Purple Heart veterans. For now, his family is moving forward with the college enrollment process for his child, he said. Among the provisions in the legislation, Murray and Tillis’ bill would also allow veterans to split up 36 months worth of benefits to each of their dependents. For example, they could transfer 20 months to one and 16 months to another. The bill, if enacted, would also prohibit the benefits from being treated as marital property or a marital estate asset. And, the bill would permit dependents to access unused benefits if their veteran family member has died. “Purple Heart recipients are heroes who honorably served our country at great costs, and this oversight that prevents servicemembers who received this distinguished award after their service from transferring their GI bill benefits to their dependents needs to be corrected immediately,” Tillis said in a statement Thursday. “I am proud to co-introduce this commonsense legislation with Sen. Murray to close this loophole and ensure every Purple Heart recipient and dependents are able to further their education,” continued Tillis, who also sits on the Senate’s Veterans’ Affairs Committee. The number of veterans who retroactively received the Purple Heart after their post-9/11 service is unclear. The bill is estimated to cost $500,000 in mandatory spending over 10 years, according to an informal analysis provided to Murray’s office by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The bill has received praise from veterans groups, including the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. “Unfortunately, not every veteran’s service and sacrifice on behalf of the United States of America is fully recognized while they’re still in uniform,” IAVA CEO and Iraq War veteran Allison Jaslow said in a statement Thursday. “The Purple Heart Veterans Education Act ensures that those veterans who’ve endured bodily harm on behalf of our nation, but weren’t recognized for it until their service concluded, are able to turn that recognition into an investment in the education of their loved ones.” The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have “greatly increased” the number of Purple Heart recipients as the Department of Defense has added some traumatic brain injuries as a recognized condition for the award, to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. It wasn’t until a that Purple Heart recipients were able to receive full post-9/11 GI Bill benefits regardless of their length of service.

The two-day event, set for June 1-2 at the Napa Valley Expo in downtown Napa, features such popular acts as Grammy-winning pop-rock group Mana, corridos tumbados specialist Junior H, multimillion-selling vocalist Alejandro Fernandez and chart-topping San Bernardino band Fuerza Regida. The party is being thrown by the same people behind the massively popular BottleRock Napa Valley, which finished up its 2024 run over Memorial Weekend with Stevie Nicks, Pearl Jam, Ed Sheeran, Megan Thee Stallion and many others. Oh, and Mana — the Day 2 (June 1) headliner at La Onda — was also set to perform at BottleRock.

        "content": "Scottish football has seen its share of deadly attacking duos in the past where two players find themselves on the same wavelength more often than not and are able to contribute with goals. This season has been no different with many clubs having two players who combined more than any other in their team throughout the campaign. Celtic, Rangers, Hearts, Hibs, Aberdeen, Kilmarnock, Motherwell and Ross County all feature on this list of deadly duos. According to data from football statistics site WhoScored, these pairs all linked up on three occasions each last season and although it was a Celtic pair who clearly had the best connection there were plenty of link-ups elsewhere: The central midfielder and the striker combined for six Premiership goals with O'Riley assisting Kyogo three times The Japanese attacker returned the favour to his teammate and assisted the Dane for three of his own goals Miovski was Aberdeen's star man once again and although Duk didn't hit the heights of his first season at Pittodrie he still combined well with his attack partner when they played together Kilmarnock clearly wouldn't have reached the heights they did this season without these two and it was Armstrong who provided the most assist to the Welsh forward",

        "content": "BOISE— Memorial Day weekend is shaping up to be a busy travel time in the Gem State. Idaho is about to enter the 100 Deadliest Days on Idaho roads- the time between Memorial Day and Labor Day when there is a spike in fatal and serious injury crashes. Seventy* people have been killed in crashes on Idaho roads so far this year — including the recent crash on US 20 in Bonneville County that tragically killed six people in one vehicle. The Idaho Office of Highway Safety (OHS) is imploring drivers to be vigilant and drive engaged this Memorial Day weekend and all summer. “We call this period the 100 Deadliest Days, but it would be great to be proven wrong. Make it safer out there for yourself and others by slowing down, putting down distractions, buckling up, and planning a sober ride home,” said OHS program manager Josephine Middleton. While it would seem like winter is the most dangerous time to drive, driving is more dangerous in summer. This seems paradoxical. Why would roads be more dangerous in summer when weather conditions are better? During the summer more people are out of school or work, on vacation, and celebrating leading to higher rates of risky behavior behind the wheel like impaired driving, distracted driving, and speeding. This summer OHS and its partners across the state will work together to remind people to make safer choices whenever they are on the road. Some of these activities will include partnering with law enforcement agencies to get dangerous drivers off the road, public awareness campaigns, and community outreach events. “We have a lot of wonderful partners who help us make Idaho’s roads a safer place, but we can’t just rely on them,” Middleton said. “We can all do a better job of looking out for each other on our roads and make it safely through this summer.” 2024 Fatality information*: 70 people killed in traffic crashes to date 2024 Fatalities by county: District 1 District 2 District 3 District 4 District 5 District 6 *All 2024 data is preliminary and subject to change.

        "description": "‘Our marriage is a partnership, we are equals who are figuring it out on the daily,’ the former NFL star writes",
        "content": "As an event consultant and mother-of-three, Kylie Kelce is much more than the keeper of the household, just ask her husband, NFL icon Jason Kelce . In response to recent criticisms aimed at his wife, the former Philadelphia Eagles took to X, formerly known as Twitter, defending her honor and their marriage with a firm message. “I don’t think of Kylie as a homemaker, I think of her as my wife. I think of her as a mother,” he stated in a 27 May post. “She has an occupation, as do I, and we keep our house the best we can. Our marriage is a partnership, we are equals who are figuring it out on the daily,” he continued. “The only expectation is that we love each other, support one another, and are committed to our family, that comes first. We both raise our kids, we both work, We both keep our home.” On 26 May, Kylie was the target of one internet sleuth’s crude comment, labeling her an inadequate “homemaker”. The blunt X user felt inclined to verbally attack Kylie after she publicly denounced Harrison Butker’s controversial Benedictine College commencement speech , arguing stay-at-home mothers should be celebrated more for their commitment and achievements rather than women in the workforce. “Your wife is a homemaker. But you can’t support Butker. And your wife is a homemaker whose home is a mess. Sorry but it is dirty and messy on television. Seems you’re a bit hypocritical. Y’all are going to be left with nothing but swifties. You just ruined your gig. It’s a shame,” the online user wrote. Jason quickly shut down the judgment, adding that when their house is “messy” it’s not his wife’s fault. “It is both our faults it is messy, but such is life with 3 young children, busy schedules, and neither of us being neat freaks,” the professional athlete said. While the 36-year-old father doesn’t consider Kylie the “homemaker”, he acknowledged that some families prefer a dynamic where one person is responsible for the house upkeep. The now-retired NFL player addressed Butker’s 11 May comments with his brother Travis on their podcast, New Heights . “A lot of the things he said in his commencement speech are not things that I align myself with, but he was giving a commencement speech at a Catholic university and – shocker – it ended up being a very religious and Catholic speech,” Jason noted to Travis, one of Butker’s teammates on the Kansas City Chiefs. Meanwhile, Travis admitted he didn’t agree with “just about any” of Butker’s points. Fourteen days after Butker, 28, gave his graduation speech, the football kicker spoke out to support the message he delivered. During Nashville’s “Courage Under Fire” event, Butker said: “If it wasn’t clear that the timeless Catholic values are hated by many, it is now. “Over the past few days, my beliefs, or what people think I believe, have been the focus of countless discussions around the globe,” he added. “At the outset, many people expressed a shocking level of hate. But as the days went on, even those who disagreed with my viewpoints shared their support for my freedom of religion. “Our love for Jesus and thus our desire to speak out should never be outweighed by the longing of our fallen nature to be loved by the world.” Apart from Butker’s shared thoughts on a woman’s role in the household, the young competitor characterized Pride Month as a “deadly sin” to Benedictine’s graduating class of 2024 and their families.",

        "content": "Smoke Justis is hosting an event designed to honor those battling Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or ALS. The event, Q4A Cure, will take place on Saturday, June 1—the same weekend as Major League Baseball’s ALS Awareness Game. The goal of Q4A Cure is to bring people together to raise money and awareness of the progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Currently, there is no cure. Smoke Justis’ founder, Richard Dickmann, has a personal connection with ALS. Get the morning's headlines right to your inbox with our newsletters Every Weekday Morning (The Daily LINK) Saturday Morning (The Weekend LINK) “In 2005, after a seven-year-long battle with ALS, I lost a good friend to the disease and another close friend is battling it right now, so for me, this cause is near and dear to me,” Dickmann said in a press release. “Over the past 30 years, I have had countless friends, relatives and customers that have had loved ones also fight this horrible disease, so, this is why we decided to host Q4A Cure. We want to bring as many people together as we can to support the mission of The ALS Association.” Starting at 11 a.m., Ben Maile and the Zack Attack band take the stage, followed by the Marty Connor Band at 3 p.m., with the Derek Alan Band closing the evening at 7 p.m. Marking the 10th anniversary of the Ice Bucket Challenge, Q4A Cure will be honoring this challenge that meant so much to the ALS community. Meals will also be provided with a minimum donation of $25 for adults and $12 for children, and pork barbecue will be included with a collection of classic sides and desserts. “On behalf of The ALS Association, I would like to express sincere gratitude to the Northern Kentucky community and everyone at Smoke Justis who have made this event possible,” said Drew Keelin, development manager of The ALS Association Kentucky Chapter. “This groundbreaking event, the first of its kind, will not only elevate awareness but will generate substantial funds for individuals bravely battling ALS.” Proceeds from Q4A Cure will be presented to The ALS Association on Sunday, June 9 during the Cincinnati Reds’ ALS Awareness Game against the Chicago Cubs.

        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS — The Boston Celtics are on the brink of advancing to the NBA Finals as they face the Indiana Pacers in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals on Monday night on ESPN. Holding a commanding 3-0 series lead, the Celtics have a chance to complete a sweep and secure their second Finals appearance in three years. You can watch the game for free on (free trial) or (free trial). (half off first month) also has promotional pricing for new customers. The Celtics’ resilience was on full display in Game 3, where despite trailing by 18 points at one stage, they clawed back to snatch a 114-111 victory. The hero of the night was Jrue Holiday, who despite battling a fever, played over 38 minutes and made a crucial steal in the final seconds to preserve the win. Holiday’s defensive play, stripping Andrew Nembhard of the ball with just 1.7 seconds left, was hailed as one of the biggest in franchise history. Now, the Celtics are one win away from the NBA Finals. Jayson Tatum had one of his best playoff performances with 36 points, 10 rebounds, and 8 assists, highlighting his capabilities as a star in the NBA. As they prepare for Game 4, the Celtics are aware of the potential pitfalls. Last season, they were on the opposite side of a 3-0 series, nearly allowing the Miami Heat to come back before winning in Game 7. Head coach Joe Mazzulla emphasized the importance of staying focused and not underestimating their opponents. “We know for one second we can’t relax,” Tatum said. “This is the playoffs, and anything can happen.” On the other side, the Pacers are fighting to keep their season alive. Despite missing their star point guard Tyrese Haliburton in Game 3 due to a hamstring injury, the Pacers showed remarkable tenacity. Andrew Nembhard and T.J. McConnell stepped up, combining for 55 points, 15 assists, and 13 rebounds. Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner also delivered strong performances, each contributing 22 points. Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle struck a defiant tone in his post-game press conference, urging his team and fans to believe in a comeback. “We have to look at what’s in front of us,” Carlisle said. “We have the best fans in the NBA here. We have the greatest basketball building on the planet and we have another game in front of them to go after these guys. And believe me when I tell you, we are going after them.” The Pacers have demonstrated resilience throughout the season, bouncing back from losses and fighting through adversity. They will be hoping for Haliburton’s return to bolster their chances, but regardless of his status, they are determined to extend the series and push it back to Boston for Game 5. “We have to give everything we have,” Siakam said. “Obviously, to this point, we’ve had an incredible season and nobody wants to see it end. We’re going to fight to the end. For us, it’s just, ‘Let’s get one game.’ We can’t look ahead. Whatever is in front of us doesn’t matter. We have to focus on the next game and give everything we have to win that game.” The Pacers’ ability to bounce back from adversity will be crucial. They have a strong track record of responding after losses, going 23-12 following defeats in the regular season. This resilience will be tested as they aim to avoid a series sweep and keep their playoff hopes alive. As the Celtics and Pacers prepare for what could be a decisive Game 4, the stage is set for another intense battle. The Celtics will look to close out the series and move on to the Finals, while the Pacers will fight to extend their season and defy the odds. Here’s more information on how you can watch the Indiana Pacers vs. Boston Celtics Here is some further background on Saturday night’s game, courtesy of the Associated Press. INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Coach Rick Carlisle expects the Indiana Pacers to punch back Monday night. Yes, he realizes no NBA team has ever rallied from a 3-0 deficit to win a best-of-seven series, and, of course, his players understand a Game 4 victory only assures them of one thing — another trip to Boston for another elimination game. And yet, Carlisle believes his players are ready to continue the fight. “We’re going to come at these guys harder on Monday,” Carlisle said Saturday after losing their first home playoff game this season. “Our fans need to come out and they need to get louder than they’ve ever been, and we’ve got to extend this series. We’ve got to get back on that plane for Game 5.” Clearly, that will be easier said than done. The Pacers have blown winnable chances in the final minute of Games 1 and 3 and hung close in Game 2 — until a left hamstring injury sent All-NBA guard Tyrese Haliburton to the locker room in the third quarter. He didn’t return that night and sat out Saturday, against his wishes. Carlisle did not say Sunday whether Haliburton might play in Game 4. Regardless, the Pacers season comes down to this — win or go home. “There’s no guy in this locker room that’s packed it in,” Pacers guard T.J. McConnell said. “We’re going to have to get one here and extend the series, then go back to Boston and try to make things difficult. But there’s no guy in this locker room that’s going to quit.” The Celtics know how this works, too. They’ve appeared in six of the last eight Eastern Conference finals and they’re now just a win away from advancing to the NBA Finals for the second time during that span. Five wins would give the franchise its first championship since 2008. But a year ago, Boston found itself facing an even trickier proposition after losing the first two games at home before getting blown out at Miami. The Celtics responded to the 3-0 deficit by winning the next three before enduring a rare Game 7 loss at home. It’s a lesson that could serve them well Monday night when they’ll try to improve to 6-0 on the road in these playoffs. “It’s huge,” All-NBA forward Jayson Tatum said after Boston’s sixth straight playoff win. “We’re in a great position right now, one win away from the finals. But we know we can’t relax for one second. A year ago, we were down 0-3 and figured out a way to force it to seven, so we’re not looking past Monday.” Tatum has been the Celtics catalyst in this series, scoring a playoff career-high 36 points twice in the first three games. The big lead also gives Boston the potential luxury of resting injured players a bit longer. Starting center Kristaps Porzingis has not played since April 29 because of a strained right calf. Backup center Luke Kornet sat out Saturday with a sprained left wrist, and coach Joe Mazzulla has no reason to rush either back now. Plus, if the Celtics pull off their first series sweep since beating Brooklyn 4-0 in the first round of the 2022 playoffs, they could get even more rest depending on the twists and turns in the Dallas-Minnesota series. The Mavericks took a 2-0 lead into Sunday night’s game at Dallas. First, though, Boston is focused on closing out the Pacers. “I believe these past few years we’ve had some battles and I feel like our group, we’ve been through it, we understand it, we’ve had some grueling, tough series and this one is no different,” said Celtics center Al Horford, who made seven 3-pointers in Game 3. “This team, it’s a very good team. They’re very dangerous, there’s a reason they’re here, and I know we’re up three, but it could easily be very different.” The Pacers know it, too, and that’s why they intend to show the basketball world just how much fight they still have left Monday night. “We’ve got to give everything that we have,” said Pacers forward Pascal Siakam, who won an NBA crown with Toronto in 2018. “Obviously, to this point we’ve had an incredible season and nobody wants to see it end. So we’re going to fight to the end, and I think it’s like let’s get one win and give everything we have to win that game.”",

        "content": "EDMONTON, Alberta, Canada – The Western Conference Finals shifts north of the border as today – Monday, May 27 – at Rogers Place in Canada. The matchup is available on multiple streaming services. Tonight’s game will broadcast live on TNT and truTV with the puck dropping at 8:30 p.m. Eastern (6:30 p.m. Mountain). Fans who have parted ways with their local cable provider can catch the game by utilizing streaming alternatives like , which offers a free trial. is also offering promotional discounts for new customers. Dallas’ Mason Marchment broke a 1-1 stalemate at 3:41 of the third period when he deflected a shot attempt, which sent the puck through the legs of Vincent Desharnais before it bounced across the ice and snuck between the sights of Oilers goalie Stuart Skinner. A massive moment by mere inches. With Edmonton gambling without their goalie in the final minutes, The Stars tacked on insurance with an Esa Lindell empty-netter with 2:03 left. Jamie Benn added the assist on the dagger, his seventh dish of the playoffs. Benn nabbed the game’s first goal and his fourth of the postseason back in the opening frame. The Stars’ Wyatt Johnson notched two assists in the strong showing. He has tallied seven goals and six assists in the playoffs. Dallas goalie Jake Oettinger was sensational under duress, garnering 28 saves, including 16 in a dangerous first period where the Stars were outshot 17-4. He was tested to his limit on a reaching save to deny Mattias Ekholm’s shot with just under four minutes left. Oettinger has saved 63 of 67 shots in the series. He has also notched above a .920 save percentage in five of the last six playoff games. He has earned 28 or more saves in three straight games. Skinner recorded 22 saves in the loss. He has allowed seven goals on 89 shots in his four starts since returning in Game 6 from being briefly benched in the Vancouver Canucks semifinal series. Connor Brown tallied Edmonton’s equalizer in the opening period, which came just 44 seconds after Dallas’ first strike. Neither team has been able to convert on their power plays, but that might change back in Canada. The Oilers are 8 of 21 (38.1%) on the power play at home in the playoffs, which is the best mark for any remaining team. They went 0 of 3 in Dallas while the Stars went 0 of 6 at home. Edmonton star Leon Draisaitl came up empty on the night, ending his remarkable 13-game streak with at least one point. It fell one game short of matching Mark Messier’s franchise record set in 1988. Draisaitl has nine goals and 16 assists in the playoffs. It was the seventh consecutive time the Stars came into Game 2 of a playoff series coming off a loss, including all three this season. Dallas is 5-1 on the road this postseason. Their defense continues to reign. The Stars have limited the opposition to just a single goal four times in the past six playoff games. Dallas’ power play and penalty kill piece, Roope Hintz, who has missed the past four games with an upper-body injury, could return for the crucial road game. He has two goals and four assists in 11 postseason games. Hintz is being considered a gametime decision. Below is a highlight recap of Dallas’ big win to even the series.

A missed opportunity at the start of the game and later a missed penalty shot didn't put off the Saints, with Zane Haywood scoring the first goal for the team. \"The boys were very... ready after all the rain that we had and we could train for a couple of weeks,\" said. \"Every single [player] played with the right intensity [and] they gave the best of themselves.\" Coming into the second half, the Saints maintained their control of the game with Chaichote Panasampon, Josh Gardner and Travis Pascoe scoring the remaining goals of the team. Paolacci said he was happy with the 4-0 victory. \"The Rangers never gave up,\" he said. \"Even when they were 4-0 down, they pushed hard. \"But the boys- every single one played their best...I don't think the Rangers could do much more than that.\" It was a special start of the game for the Macleay Valley Rangers with life member and n celebrating his 80 birthday. Rangers players and club members formed a guard of honour as Morn walked the first grade game ball out. \"We had a reveal day where we named the bar area Keith's Corner,\" Rangers coach Jason Coleman said. \"To have him carry the match ball and stand with First Grade was an honour to pay homage to a true legend of the club.\" The Rangers suffered having key players away for the match with additional team mates having to withdraw during the game due to injuries. But the team won't have long to rest. An upcoming game to make up for the first round that was cancelled due to wet weather is scheduled to take place against the Camden Haven Redbacks on Wednesday, May 29. But Coleman said getting the games were good for the team. \"We need to be getting game time,\" he said. \"We've been getting washed out or we're having byes- we need to be playing.\" Coming into the Redbacks game, Coleman said his team will need to improve in areas. \"I think what we need to bring to the table is we need to...work on our intensity,\" he said. \"What it came down to on the weekend, they [the Saints] wanted the game more than we did. \"Obviously when you're going to a everyone wants to knock you off.\" The Saints will also be facing the Redbacks later in the week on Saturday, June 1. \"It's another game,\" Paolacci said. \"It's not easy to play them but I think winning against the Rangers will give some confidence to the boys.\" Reporter at Macleay Argus and Port Macquarie News.

        "description": "A year and a half on from the devastation of her namesake, Gabrielle Mei can return home.",
        "content": "More than a year after her namesake took nearly everything away, Wairoa resident Gabrielle Mei’s house is almost ready for her to move back into. The heavy rain hitting northern Hawke’s Bay last week had been an unpleasant reminder of Cyclone Gabrielle for the 89-year-old as it pelted her temporary “pod” abode in the backyard of her property. Shortly after 8am on February 14, 2023, the banks of the Wairoa River broke and Mei’s home where Crarer St turns into Ruataniwha Rd was one of just over 100 properties in Wairoa hit by 1.5 metre flood waters. The mother of six had no whānau living in Wairoa and lived alone, but she was whisked away by a neighbour who came to warn her before the flood waters arrived. “I wasn’t sure what she was talking about when she came to get me, because the sun was shining,” Mei said. In the whirlwind aftermath of the following days, between 20 and 50 fellow residents waded in to help clean up her property. “I was really grateful for that. People I didn’t even know, I had seen a few around town but I didn’t know personally,” Mei said. Mei avoided saying Cyclone Gabrielle when answering questions about that time. It still feels strange to call the cyclone by her name. “I’m a bit frightened of what people might say when they hear what my name is,” she laughed. From her backyard which was once again under water 15 months later, Mei laughs again as she describes the only memento she still kept from before flood waters tore through her home - an old bath plug she found embedded in the mud. “When everything is washed away you’ve got no shoes, no gumboots, no raincoat. You struggle to get clothes and stuff,” Mei said. “I found the bath plug. I thought ‘Oh my goodness’.” Her home is finally in the last stages of the repairs and she said it will likely be ready for her to move back into next month. “I think the last stage is the painting, then they will do the flooring and the carpet and all that.” She has lived in Wairoa for most of her life, outside of a 20-year stint in Wellington during which she missed the impact of Cyclone Bola on the region. “I didn’t realise what a cyclone was really because I had never been in a flood like Bola,” Mei said. She did remember flooding in Wairoa during the North Island storm of 1948 when she was about 12 years old. The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa) NZ Historic Weather Events Catalogue noted “extensive flooding” on the Wairoa River from Frasertown downstream, silt and heavy stock losses at the time. Highways and country roads suffered damage and all parts of the Wairoa district, except the Wairoa borough, were without power anywhere from one evening to three days and Wairoa was without water for a week. “It was a lot of water, it came through the same way as it did for Bola and [Cyclone Gabrielle],” Mei said. James Pocock joined Hawke’s Bay Today in 2021 and writes breaking news and features, with a focus on the environment, local government and post-cyclone issues in the region. He has a keen interest in finding the bigger picture in research and making it more accessible to audiences. He lives in Napier. james.pocock@nzme.co.nz Share this article",

        "content": "Prime Minister James Marape is cautiously confident he has the numbers to beat the Vote of No Confidence and remain in power. At last count yesterday, Marape had 49 MPs on Loloata with him while challenger Rainbo Paita had the support of 39 MPs at the Sanctuary Hotel in North Waigani. However, today is a normal sorting out day as Parliament resumes at 2pm. No Vote Of no Confidence (VONC) will be entertained today as the Paita Alternate Government will need to submit a new motion to Parliament. Marape said any moves by the Alternate Government led by Rainbo Paita will be defeated as lobbying intensified last night. There were several MPs who have been notably absent from both camps and are expected to make their move today or in the week. Parliament meets for its May sitting at 2 pm today and the numbers will become clearer when the MPs take their seats. Parliament has also advised that the sitting arrangements have not been arranged as they are waiting on the list from both camps. Marape and team will head to Parliament today with six ministerial seats vacant including the Leader of Government Business, since the defect and decommissioning of ministers. Leaders from both camps will be advised today of the list from either side for sitting arrangements. In response to questions asked by Post-Courier, Parliament stated that the motion was to be submitted and the Private Business Committee (PBC) would sit and go through for vetting. The notice when submitted must include the name of the alternative PM. Once the PBC is satisfied that the required procedures have been followed, the motion is then listed on the notice paper. The next day the Speaker announces to Parliament that a vote of no confidence has been moved against the PM. Parliament is adjourned for a week and then proceeds with a vote of no confidence. This process can be delayed if government MPs dominate the PBC. Alternate Prime Minister Rainbo Paita said that what happens in Parliament is the prerogative of all members on the floor of parliament",

        "description": "Rafael Nadal is unsure if he will be back next year at Roland-Garros – the tournament he won 14 times – after bowing out in the first round.",
        "content": "Fourteen-time champion Rafael Nadal has cast serious doubt on whether he will play the French Open again after suffering his earliest exit ever at Roland-Garros. This year’s Olympic Games will be played at the home of the claycourt major, so Nadal will be back for that – assuming his battle-weary body lets him – but there is every chance he has contested his last match at his favourite tournament. Rafael Nadal remains unsure if he will return to Roland-Garros next year. Credit: Getty Images Nadal conceded as much after Alex Zverev played the party-pooper in a 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 first-round triumph across three-plus hours under Roland-Garros’ new retractable roof as the German bids to win his maiden grand slam title. “It’s difficult for me to talk. I don’t know [if] it’s going to be the last time that I’m going to be here in front of all of you, honestly. I am not 100 per cent sure,” Nadal said. “But if it’s the last time, I enjoyed it. The crowd have been amazing during the whole week of preparation, and the feelings that I have today are difficult to describe in words, but for me, it’s so special to feel the love of the people the way that I felt in the place that I love the most. “It’s difficult to say what’s going on in the future. It’s a big percentage that I will not be back playing here at Roland-Garros, but I can say 100 per cent I enjoy a lot playing here. “I am travelling with family, and I am having fun, and the body is feeling a little bit better now than two months ago. I think maybe in two months, I [might] say it’s enough, I can’t give anything else, but it’s something that I don’t feel yet. I have some goals in front. “I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics – that motivates me, that’s going to be another chance. I really hope to be well-prepared [for that].” The Parisian crowd did everything they could to get Nadal across the line. Credit: Getty Images There was enough doubt for the likes of world No.1s Novak Djokovic and Iga Świątek, plus Nadal’s Spanish successor Carlos Alcaraz, to cram into a frenzied Court Philippe-Chatrier just in case this was it. The lion’s share of the crowd, from Nadal’s wife Maria Francisca Perello to his father Sebastian, long-time coach Carlos Moya and Spanish Tennis Federation boss Miguel Díaz Román, were left disappointed as he lost in the first round at Roland-Garros for the first time. Handed a painfully difficult draw against Rome champion and world No.4 Zverev in a rare visit to Paris as an unseeded competitor, Nadal produced some of his best tennis of the year. The 37-year-old legend played well enough to be up a break on Zverev – whose domestic violence trial in Germany will be held mid-tournament, without him needing to attend – in the second and third sets, but could not hang on. Zverev quickly reeled Nadal in each time he fell behind and looked every bit the title contender he is being billed as. The roof on Court Philippe-Chatrier, under which back-to-back women’s champion Świątek earlier breezed through to the second round for the loss of only three games on a rainy Paris day, was another reminder of the changing times. Even so, Nadal’s ability to still challenge one of the sport’s best players off an abbreviated preparation might be why he is finding it so hard to let go. There was mutual respect between Nadal and Alex Zverev. Credit: AP This was a much more pleasant experience for Zverev than their last meeting on this court. That epic, high-quality semi-final stoush two years ago ended prematurely when the German rolled his right ankle and tore three lateral ligaments before leaving in a wheelchair. “I have to congratulate Sasha [Zverev] for this great match and last week, [his] victory in Rome, and I really wish you all the best for the rest of the tournament,” Nadal said. “2022, I know was a super tough moment for you, so you deserve more, so many congratulations and all the best. “I have been going through a very tough two years, in terms of injuries. I went all through this process with the dream to be back here at Roland-Garros. It’s true that the first round [draw] hasn’t been the ideal one ... I was competitive, I had my chances, but it was not enough against a great player like Sasha.” Zverev spoke briefly, and graciously, before Nadal but quickly stepped aside to let the 22-time grand slam winner take centre stage. “To be honest, I don’t know what to say. First of all, thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,” Zverev said. “It’s such a great honour [to share the court with you]. I’ve watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court, and I don’t know what to say – today is not my moment, it’s Rafa’s moment.” Nadal took his time deciding whether to contest this year’s claycourt slam as he struggled to play anywhere near his imperious best on the red dirt, a surface he was nigh on invincible on for most of his hall-of-fame career. The former world No.1’s mind remains willing, but his ailing body stopped him making his much-anticipated return at this year’s Australian Open despite him playing in Brisbane and there were several other withdrawals after that, even throughout the clay season. Once Nadal finally did play, he was suddenly a mere mortal. Alex de Minaur became the first Australian to beat Nadal on clay in Barcelona, but conceded moments afterwards that the result would have been different in the Spaniard’s prime. Nadal recovered to exact revenge on Australia’s top player a week later in Madrid. However, he failed to reach even a quarter-final in any of the four clay tournaments he contested in 2024. Nadal fought hard but could not overcome title contender Zverev. Credit: AP He walked on court at Roland-Garros as a significant underdog – another new feeling – but gave his army of admirers plenty to cheer. Nadal picked at his shorts, pumped his fist with vigour after winning clutch points, oozed energy in general and fought as doggedly as ever. There were outrageously good low volley winners, screaming down-the-line forehands – including one brilliant one on the run off a Zverev overhead – and fearless shot-making in moments others shrink in. But Nadal mostly struggled to match Zverev’s big striking from the baseline, and reverted to serve-volleying where he could to shorten the rallies. As de Minaur effectively said after beating him in Barcelona: this is not the same Nadal who reigned over France for more than a decade. The end is nigh, but the Paris crowd revelled in the chance to watch the master one last time. Sports news, results and expert commentary. Sign up for our Sport newsletter .",

        "description": "Even if your own family doesn't have any graduates this year, it's likely you will have at least one graduation party to attend this season for a family member, friend or neighbor.",
        "content": "Graduation season is a time of celebrating accomplishments and extending best wishes for life's next chapter, but it can also be a time of stress when juggling party planning and gift decisions. In the National Retail Federation's annual graduation gift survey from last year, feedback from more than 8,400 consumers found people expected to spend an average of $116.19 for graduation gifts, with 52% planning to give cash instead of shopping for an item. And for those hosting instead of attending grad festivities, organizing a celebration could involve a lot of money and time. Even if your own family doesn't have any graduates this year, it's likely you will have at least one graduation party to attend this season for a family member, friend or neighbor. Depending on your family's circumstances, you could have three or four different parties on the same day to juggle. If you need help figuring out how to survive this busy time of year, here's some expert advice to follow: Gifts required? ADVERTISEMENT Graduation parties might be largely informal, but there is still some etiquette to keep in mind, said Lizzie Post, co-president of the Vermont-based Emily Post Institute. Post is a great-great-granddaughter of Emily Post, who published the book \"Etiquette\" in 1922. Despite any social pressure you might feel about buying a gift, Post said it's not obligatory. \"You don't actually have to get a graduate a gift,\" Post said. \"The obligation shouldn't feel as heavy as a wedding. There is no registry for a graduation party.\" The same goes for joint graduation parties where siblings or friends might celebrate together. Post said you don't have to buy a gift for every honoree, especially if you only know certain graduates well. Money matters Post said it's become a trend for graduation party hosts to push \"money apps\" like Venmo for gifts, but she maintains: \"It's really rude.\" So don't feel you must participate in that. Cash itself remains a perfectly acceptable gift, even if it has disappeared from many corners of society. \"It's not uncommon to see actual paper money as a gift these days,\" Post said. After the event, Post said you should expect a handwritten thank-you note from the graduate if you gave a gift (not just a text or email). Call it an old-school gesture of gratitude. ADVERTISEMENT Potential products If cash or a check doesn't feel right for you, but you still want to give the grad in your life some token, a good ol' Google search can show you dozens of vetted options via lists from various publications. Forbes Vetted, a website connected to the business magazine focused on product recommendations, published its \"55 Best Graduation Gifts In 2024′′ in March. Forbes Vetted identified options for high school and college grads ranging from a stainless steel bookmark for $7 to a Chanel bag for $1,700. Many ideas were less than $100 and wide-ranging from cookies to footwear to a tote bag to an air fryer. Jenny Putnam, one of the owners of General Store of Minnetonka, said Enewton beaded bracelets are a popular item this year, particularly for mothers shopping for a gift for a daughter. Putnam also pointed to the book \"Dear Graduate,\" originally published in 2022, which poses questions about life values as students prepare to take a step forward. \"It's new on our shelves,\" Putnam said, calling the book \"something more universal\" as a gift option. Dress code If invited to a fancy restaurant for the party, you should make an effort to dress appropriately, Post said, so your clothes fit the occasion. But in many cases — like the ever-popular driveway buffet or park picnic — going casual works just fine. \"If it's a backyard barbecue, it's probably anything goes,\" Post said. ADVERTISEMENT Planning ahead Advance planning is essential if you're trying to hold an event-style graduation party, said event planner Kat Minks. Minks said the ideal time for mailing invitations is in March or April for parties held in June or July. So mark your calendars if you have a graduate in 2025. If you're just starting now, evites are a quicker route, or you could have a party later in the summer to avoid some of the rush. Once party season arrives, rental companies will have already rented out all of their chairs and tents for specific dates, making it tough to find those items on a last-minute basis for prime dates like weekends, Minks said. So again, sooner rather than later. For some, a do-it-yourself party is the best option. Minneapolis-based Litin's Party Value is one resource for finding DIY party supplies such as banners, balloons, decor, confetti, guest books, card boxes and more. \"Graduation is actually our busiest season,\" said Justin Alexander, general manager of Litin's Party Value. Alexander said people tend to underestimate how many people will show up to the graduation party, so he recommends shopping early and planning ahead. The store's most popular items, he said, have the graduation year \"2024\" emblazoned on them, while the second-most popular items feature the various school colors. Prices will vary depending how many supplies you buy, but Alexander said spending $2.50 to $3.50 per guest is a reasonable estimate. An event planner could also take on some of the stress, for a fee. Minks said her services are more in demand these days because parents are busier and don't have time for extensive party planning. ADVERTISEMENT \"It gets so overwhelming for the parents now,\" said Minks, who owns Bloomington-based Adore Productions. \"Their life is too busy to handle it.\" Minks said many event planners will charge $3,500 to $4,000 for the typical graduation party, which draws about 150 to 200 people through a two-to-three-hour open house. She added high school graduation parties are dominant, though she sees a few college graduation events, too. But she has noticed graduation parties in general are trending a little more upscale than a garage party with hamburgers and hot dogs. \"Now you're more likely to do catering,\" Minks said. Food for thought Food trucks have emerged in recent years as an increasingly popular option for graduation parties. \"It's easy to do a food truck for a graduation party because everybody's not showing up at the same time,\" Minks said. Woodbury-based grocer Kowalski's Markets offers food on wheels with its Joy of Good Food Truck used for community events, weddings and graduation parties. \"It's pretty popular,\" said Rachael Perron, culinary and branding director for Kowalski's Markets. ADVERTISEMENT Kowalski's charges $750 to book the food truck and requires a food order of at least $750, which brings the overall minimum cost to $1,500. Kowalski's catering team operates the truck, which has a menu including tacos, hamburgers, hot dogs, pulled pork sandwiches and side dishes. Ingredients all come from Kowalski's stores. \"It's a product that you can't get anywhere else,\" Perron said. \"It's a great convenient option. They just show up and serve everything.\" If a food truck seems like too much, Kowalski's stores offer a range of party trays for sandwiches, veggies, fruits and more. Popular restaurants also have catering packages. For example, Chipotle, likely to be a big hit among the graduating-age crowd, has premade burrito boxes and build-your-own setups for $8.75 a person. Activities first Some grads might not want just afternoon conversation and Bluetooth-speaker music, so explore a gathering at an entertainment venue. WhirlyBall Twin Cities, with locations in Bloomington and Maple Grove, will host events and parties, for example. WhirlyBall is a team sport combining elements of basketball, lacrosse and hockey where players ride in bumper cars and use scoops to toss a whiffle ball toward the goal. WhirlyBall Twin Cities owner Nick Lambrecht said it has hosted senior class parties, post-prom parties and graduation parties in a space that can hold up to 500 people. WhirlyBall also offers laser tag, bowling, escape rooms and food with private and banquet rooms for smaller groups. \"It's not the most typical,\" he said, \"but it can be a lot of fun.\" ADVERTISEMENT Lambrecht said booking WhirlyBall could cost \"in the thousands\" to more than $10,000 for a large group. Reserving a picnic shelter at a local park and supplying your own lawn games or heading to a lake beach for water sports are some other lower-cost options. Don't forget Whether you're going to a graduation celebration or putting it on, the one aspect to keep in mind is the graduates themselves. Make sure whatever gift you give, food you serve or party you plan suits the grad's personality. If the student is going to acting school, rent a screen to show recordings of his school performances. If your grad loves popcorn, serve all of her favorite kinds at the party. If this graduate is going on to study at the University of Minnesota, find stationery/card/gift wrap with maroon and gold colors (or maybe even a gopher) for your present. Make the event special and unique so it will remain a cherished memory for years to come. ©2024 StarTribune. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

        "content": "Bobby Green has a big fight coming up at UFC 304 , but there’s another name he’s added to his hit list. Green meets Paddy Pimblett on the July 27 pay-per-view event in Manchester, England. Speaking on The MMA Hour , “King” previewed the Pimblett matchup, but said another fighter has also been relentlessly talking smack to him in his social media DMs. That fighter? Dillon Danis . “I don’t even want to give this guy the f*cking clout or the shine ...” Green said. “It’s the guy who sucks clout like no other. That guy is looking to suck up clout anywhere he can find it. “The Logan Paul fight [with Danis], that was f*cking horrible. It was such a terrible representation of what he should put as his work of art. That’s a terrible representation of that, and so he’s been hopping in my DMs and trying to talk sh*t to me, to promote to fight this guy. I’m like Dillon, Dilly, I don’t know where you think we’re even on the same level. I’m a full-fledged killer, you’re just a talker. You [haven’t] even fought nobody real.” Green said it all began after Danis’ back-and-forth with former UFC fighter Paige VanZant , which saw VanZant light up Danis as a “piece of sh*t” and not a real fighter. Danis’ approach to trash talk and promotion is behavior Green would like to use as an example for young fighters — specifically, how not to act. “I was talking to the young guys saying, ‘Don’t be like those guys.’ Because why? You’re going to hate it when [someone like VanZant] tells you [that] you ain’t sh*t,” Green said. “He jumped his ass in there, and now he’s begging for a fight with me. Man, before, these guys wouldn’t pay attention to me. I would post sh*t, I would talk sh*t to them, and they wouldn’t even pay attention to me. And now Dillon, he can’t stop messaging me. “And I’ve been kicking his ass every f*cking time. Kicking his ass.” In his most recent outing, Green earned a lopsided decision win over Jim Miller at UFC 300 in April. Green said he’s been hoping to get the chance to fight Pimblett for quite some time, and now he has it. It’s no coincidence that Green sees Danis and Pimblett as similar when it comes to trash talk and accolades. “In real life, [Danis is] getting beat up by a Logan [Paul], he’s getting beat up by a podcaster,” Green said. “He’s getting beat up by a fake wrestler. In real life, you’re not one of us. It’s the cool kids versus the brats. And Paddy’s another one of the brats. Look how he talks. “Look at him acting spoiled and sh*t like he did some sh*t. You ain’t done nothing in this motherf*cker yet to be talking about, and thinking you’ve earned something. You ain’t earned sh*t yet.”",

Well, about six months ago we fell in love with a small-breed young dog and brought her home. It did not occur to us that this might create a problem. Cassie now seems stressed and unhappy all the time. She tries to hide from the younger dog, who has playfully nipped at her. We spoke with our vet, who suggested “rehoming” the younger dog. She told us that some animal dynamics just don’t work out. We don’t want our elder dog to spend her final years stressed and unhappy. We have learned that friends of ours would like to take the young dog, but we feel so guilty about doing this. We are reaching out for some of your compassionate common sense. – Guilty DEAR GUILTY: Assuming responsibility for the life, health, and happiness of an animal is an almost sacred stewardship. We owe it to our animals to make the hard choices in what we believe will be in their best interests. And yes, oftentimes guilt follows the hardest choices.

        "description": "It's all about missing teenager Lauren Bolton on the cobbles this week as Coronation Street fans will finally learn what happened to the troubled youngster when she vanished",
        "content": "Coronation Street fans will finally get to the bottom of Lauren Bolton's disappearance this week. Actress Cait Fitton, who plays Lauren in the soap, joined the Corrie cast back in 2022 and has since been part of some gripping storylines. Earlier this year, the youngster abruptly vanished and Roy Cropper has found himself arrested and charged as the number one suspect in her case. Away from the cameras, Cait lives a completely different life from her troublesome character and loves to dress up and get glam. Here, the Mirror takes a look at her career, co-star friends and incredible talent... ITV Coronation Street's special Lauren Bolton week: Killer revealed, shock arrest and Roy in danger Cait likes to dress up and feel glam away from the soap ( Image: Cait Fitton/Instagram) The 22-year-old loves music and sings as well as acts ( Image: Cait Fitton/Instagram) Cait is best known for her acting abilities, with her role in Corrie coming after appearances in Doctors and CBeebies show Gigglebiz - but she also has a gift for singing. The 22-year-old has previously shared a video of her singing on Instagram , wowing followers with a pitch-perfect rendition of Ben E. King's Stand By Me. The multi-talented soap star, who is originally from Middleton, Greater Manchester , captioned the post: \"I feel beyond privileged to say my professional showreel has been filmed by @olibogroup and I am mega excited to share it with you guys!\" As much as she loves music, it would appear that a part in Corrie has always been her greatest dream. Speaking with The Sun back in August, Cait recalled: \"The teacher asked us, 'What do you want to be when you're older?' Children were saying 'a fireman' or 'a nurse', and I said, 'I want to be in Coronation Street '. I remember all the teachers were amused, they couldn't believe it. I watched it religiously.\" She added: \"I loved Gail and Becky and Kylie and I'd think, 'This is my dream'. I spent so long dreaming about it and wanted it so badly. Sometimes I'd despair and think it was never going to happen, but it just shows that if you fight and you work hard for your dreams, you can achieve.\" Cait attended the British Soap Awards in 2023 ( Image: David Fisher/REX/Shutterstock) She has a real friendship with co-star Paddy Bever ( Image: @caitfitt0n/Instagram) Cait regularly updates her followers on social media with snaps from behind the scenes on the soap, and counts Paddy Bever, who plays Max on the show, as one of her best friends, alongside Julia Goulding , who she said \"took me under her wing\". \"Everyone's just been so nice. It's been amazing. Everyone's been so kind,\" she said of her beloved Corrie family. For life-long soap fan Cait, bagging the role of Lauren was a real 'pinch me moment', and her excitement was made clear in a celebratory Instagram post thanking her loved ones for their support. But sadly, not all were there to share her special news. Cait wrote: \"My younger self is screaming right now!!! I want to say a big thank you to all the cast and crew at @coronationstreet for inviting me in with open arms and making me feel so welcome! Thank you to my amazing agent Brooke Kinsella at @intertalentactors for constantly supporting me and always pushing me to achieve.\" Remembering family members who have passed on, she continued: \"Also a massive thank you to my family and friends who have supported me throughout this process and been with me along the journey so far! I dedicate this role of achievement to my family who were huge fans of the show but unfortunately are no longer with me, but I know if they were, they'd be bursting at the seams!\" Coronation Street airs every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 8pm on ITV and can be streamed on ITVX.

        "content": "Everyone knows is his practical effects. do actual stunts and capture them in-camera, and the results are masterful. But what maybe not everyone knows is that Miller’s films, in particular and the new , have a ton of visual effects. Like, . He just doesn’t use them only in obvious ways. “ , in [ ], there are hardly any shots that haven’t been manipulated digitally,” Miller told io9. “For instance, changing the sky. When , the sea was changing all the time. If you look at that film one moment it’s choppy, one moment it’s flat. You don’t need to do that anymore.” So basically every shot in both and has some kind of digital changes to it. But, for the most part, it’s subtle stuff. The scene Miller pointed to was “The Stowaway,” one of the film’s middle chapters and also its longest, most sprawling action sequence. In it, Furiosa (Anya Taylor-Joy) tries to escape the Citadel but instead finds herself in an epic battle versus a group of Wasteland pirates. “When you’re doing extended sequences like ‘The Stowaway’ sequence, that was shot over 78 days. It’s a 15-minute sequence but the skies are consistent,” Miller said. “So we took what we thought was a good sky and we can reproduce that sky right through the story. So some shots have the real sky because the real sky looked really good. But in the next shot, it might have been where it was a completely different sky so we were able to match that. You can do that.” The film clearly has other digital effects too but Miller is mostly a fan of the ones that are invisible and keep everything smooth and cohesive. It’s a huge game-changer. “If you were shooting again today, the sea would be consistent,” He said. “Even meticulous filmmakers, guys like David Lean when they shot —obsessively, meticulous with their camera and lighting and so on—you can see where they shot different times of day and so on. You can avoid it now to some degree. It’s a much smoother experience Visually, might be a smooth experience but the experience overall is anything but, in the best possible way. It’s now in theaters.",

        "description": "Brings 140 years of manufacturing at the site to an end",
        "content": "Dulux is to shut its paint manufacturing business on Cork’s Commons Road by the end of this year with the loss of 45 jobs and ending a 140-year history of manufacturing on the site. The company, owned by Dutch multinational AkzoNobel, confirmed the manufacturing site and warehouse is to shut with operations moving to the UK as part of a rationalisation programme. When contacted by the Irish Examiner, Dulux said the Cork site requires significant renovations, upgrades and investment in order to futureproof it in the short term and that longer term, a new plant would have to be developed. As a result, it has decided to shut it in a move that would result in 45 redundancies. Most of the site’s current manufacturing volumes will be moved to the UK which will supply Dulux paint for the Irish market. “We understand the impact this will have on our colleagues and know that the coming weeks will be really difficult for everyone in our Cork plant, many of whom have worked at the site for more than 30 years,” said Seamus O’Donoghue, managing director, Dulux Paints Ireland. “We have an outstanding team in Ireland. But, as a global business we have an obligation to continually look at ways in which we can improve our processes, ensuring our products are produced more efficiently while maintaining the highest standards of quality not just now but into the future,” he said. The company said it will concentrate its efforts on supporting workers impacted by the decision and arrangements are being made to meet and consult with employee and union representatives. It said the only operation to cease in Ireland would be paint production with the company planning further investment in its non-manufacturing operations in Dublin. Sales, marketing, warehousing and logistics as well as AkzoNobel’s Dublin location are not impacted. The company will also expand warehouse capacity in Dublin to supply the Irish market. Under the same rationalisation programme, AkzoNobel said it is also closing plants in Groot-Ammers in The Netherlands and Lusaka in Zambia as part of a multi-year efficiency plan. When the Cprk plant finally closes at the end of this year, it will bring to an end more than 140 years of continuous manufacturing operations on the site. The plant on the city’s Commons Road which straddles the River Bride, has been at the forefront of the Irish paint industry for over 14 decades, dating back to when it originally opened its doors in 1885 when it was established for the manufacture of chemicals. By the formation of the Irish Free State in 1922, it was the largest paint and varnish manufacturer in the country. In the 1930s HGW Paints, as it was then known, partnered with British chemical firm ICI in the production of special paints for the Henry Ford assembly plant in Cork. In the 1960s the facility took responsibility for the manufacturing and marketing of ICI’s Dulux brand in Ireland. ICI was acquired by AkzoNobel in 2008 and more than €2m was invested in the plant in 2010 to upgrade the facility. A collection of the latest business articles and business analysis from Cork.",

        "description": "Rafael Nadal is unsure if he will be back next year at Roland-Garros – the tournament he won 14 times – after bowing out in the first round.",
        "content": "Fourteen-time champion Rafael Nadal has cast serious doubt on whether he will play the French Open again after suffering his earliest exit ever at Roland-Garros. This year’s Olympic Games will be played at the home of the claycourt major, so Nadal will be back for that – assuming his battle-weary body lets him – but there is every chance he has contested his last match at his favourite tournament. Rafael Nadal remains unsure if he will return to Roland-Garros next year. Credit: Getty Images Nadal conceded as much after Alex Zverev played the party-pooper in a 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 first-round triumph across three-plus hours under Roland-Garros’ new retractable roof as the German bids to win his maiden grand slam title. “It’s difficult for me to talk. I don’t know [if] it’s going to be the last time that I’m going to be here in front of all of you, honestly. I am not 100 per cent sure,” Nadal said. Loading “But if it’s the last time, I enjoyed it. The crowd have been amazing during the whole week of preparation, and the feelings that I have today are difficult to describe in words, but for me, it’s so special to feel the love of the people the way that I felt in the place that I love the most. “It’s difficult to say what’s going on in the future. It’s a big percentage that I will not be back playing here at Roland-Garros, but I can say 100 per cent I enjoy a lot playing here. “I am travelling with family, and I am having fun, and the body is feeling a little bit better now than two months ago. I think maybe in two months, I [might] say it’s enough, I can’t give anything else, but it’s something that I don’t feel yet. I have some goals in front. “I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics – that motivates me, that’s going to be another chance. I really hope to be well-prepared [for that].” The Parisian crowd did everything they could to get Nadal across the line. Credit: Getty Images There was enough doubt for the likes of world No.1s Novak Djokovic and Iga Świątek, plus Nadal’s Spanish successor Carlos Alcaraz, to cram into a frenzied Court Philippe-Chatrier just in case this was it. The lion’s share of the crowd, from Nadal’s wife Maria Francisca Perello to his father Sebastian, long-time coach Carlos Moya and Spanish Tennis Federation boss Miguel Díaz Román, were left disappointed as he lost in the first round at Roland-Garros for the first time. Handed a painfully difficult draw against Rome champion and world No.4 Zverev in a rare visit to Paris as an unseeded competitor, Nadal produced some of his best tennis of the year. The 37-year-old legend played well enough to be up a break on Zverev – whose domestic violence trial in Germany will be held mid-tournament, without him needing to attend – in the second and third sets, but could not hang on. Zverev quickly reeled Nadal in each time he fell behind and looked every bit the title contender he is being billed as. The roof on Court Philippe-Chatrier, under which back-to-back women’s champion Świątek earlier breezed through to the second round for the loss of only three games on a rainy Paris day, was another reminder of the changing times. Even so, Nadal’s ability to still challenge one of the sport’s best players off an abbreviated preparation might be why he is finding it so hard to let go. There was mutual respect between Nadal and Alex Zverev. Credit: AP This was a much more pleasant experience for Zverev than their last meeting on this court. That epic, high-quality semi-final stoush two years ago ended prematurely when the German rolled his right ankle and tore three lateral ligaments before leaving in a wheelchair. “I have to congratulate Sasha [Zverev] for this great match and last week, [his] victory in Rome, and I really wish you all the best for the rest of the tournament,” Nadal said. “2022, I know was a super tough moment for you, so you deserve more, so many congratulations and all the best. “I have been going through a very tough two years, in terms of injuries. I went all through this process with the dream to be back here at Roland-Garros. It’s true that the first round [draw] hasn’t been the ideal one ... I was competitive, I had my chances, but it was not enough against a great player like Sasha.” Zverev spoke briefly, and graciously, before Nadal but quickly stepped aside to let the 22-time grand slam winner take centre stage. “To be honest, I don’t know what to say. First of all, thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,” Zverev said. Loading “It’s such a great honour [to share the court with you]. I’ve watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court, and I don’t know what to say – today is not my moment, it’s Rafa’s moment.” Nadal took his time deciding whether to contest this year’s claycourt slam as he struggled to play anywhere near his imperious best on the red dirt, a surface he was nigh on invincible on for most of his hall-of-fame career. The former world No.1’s mind remains willing, but his ailing body stopped him making his much-anticipated return at this year’s Australian Open despite him playing in Brisbane and there were several other withdrawals after that, even throughout the clay season. Once Nadal finally did play, he was suddenly a mere mortal. Alex de Minaur became the first Australian to beat Nadal on clay in Barcelona, but conceded moments afterwards that the result would have been different in the Spaniard’s prime. Nadal recovered to exact revenge on Australia’s top player a week later in Madrid. However, he failed to reach even a quarter-final in any of the four clay tournaments he contested in 2024. Nadal fought hard but could not overcome title contender Zverev. Credit: AP He walked on court at Roland-Garros as a significant underdog – another new feeling – but gave his army of admirers plenty to cheer. Nadal picked at his shorts, pumped his fist with vigour after winning clutch points, oozed energy in general and fought as doggedly as ever. There were outrageously good low volley winners, screaming down-the-line forehands – including one brilliant one on the run off a Zverev overhead – and fearless shot-making in moments others shrink in. But Nadal mostly struggled to match Zverev’s big striking from the baseline, and reverted to serve-volleying where he could to shorten the rallies. As de Minaur effectively said after beating him in Barcelona: this is not the same Nadal who reigned over France for more than a decade. The end is nigh, but the Paris crowd revelled in the chance to watch the master one last time. Sports news, results and expert commentary. Sign up for our Sport newsletter .

        "description": "At least 28 of the 153 people released after indefinite detention was declared unlawful have allegedly gone on to commit fresh crimes.",
        "content": "Nearly a fifth of former immigration detainees freed following the High Court’s landmark decision in November have since been charged with state offences, compounding pressure on the Albanese government to use new laws to lock up those at high risk of committing new crimes. According to March figures recently shown to the Senate by Home Affairs, at least 28 of the 153 people released into the community on strict visa conditions after the court declared indefinite detention unlawful have been charged with offences under state laws. Immigration Minister Andrew Giles is facing a deepening crisis over the High Court detention fallout. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen The revelation raises even more questions about Labor’s handling of the crisis after the government conceded last month it was powerless to intervene in state justice systems following a former detainee’s alleged involvement in a violent home invasion in Perth. Coalition home affairs spokesman James Paterson said the government had still not applied to a judge for an order to re-detain anyone who posed an unacceptable community risk more than six months after passing the tough new legislation with the help of the opposition. “At least 28 members of the NZYQ cohort have reoffended after being released into the community,” Paterson said. “How bad does the detainee crime spree need to get before they act?” This masthead revealed former detainee Majid Jamshidi Doukoshkan, 43, wasn’t wearing an ankle monitor at the time he was allegedly involved in the violent Perth home robbery on April 16. Coalition home affairs spokesman James Paterson has questioned when the government will make an application for preventative detention. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen It is not known how many of the 28 have been subject to electronic surveillance, but government figures released on May 10 said only 76 of the 153 former detainees were wearing the devices as part of their visa conditions. The March 24 figure was supplied by the department in answer to a question on notice from Senate estimates on March 27, and is a marked increase from the 18 former detainees who had been charged by state and territory police as of February 1. During the committee hearing, Australian Border Force commissioner Michael Outram, who is leading authorities’ supervision of former detainees alongside the Australian Federal Police, said the agency did not keep a “running tally” of people who had been charged with state offences. “What we need to know is whether there is somebody in the community who requires the visa conditions to be applied or not,” he said. “What they’re charged with, when they’re charged, when the state prosecutors change charges, which they do frequently, or drop cases or amend cases – we do not need to keep a running tally on all of that, and we don’t.” Asylum Seeker Resource Centre principal solicitor Hannah Dickinson said people released following the High Court decision were subject to minimal support “subjected to invasive and distressing conditions and to alarming vilification by politicians and the media, a maelstrom which prevented many from accessing employment, housing and other vital supports”. A spokesman for Immigration Minister Andrew Giles said the community protection board makes visa condition recommendations based on individual circumstances but “beyond this, the management of state crimes is a matter for state jurisdictions”. Giles is currently reeling from yet another detainee scandal after it emerged last week that a tribunal, acting partly in accordance with a ministerial direction he issued last year, had released a former detainee, Emmanuel Saki, who went on to allegedly commit murder. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal reinstated Saki’s visa on March 27, partly due to new rules introduced by Giles last year requiring the tribunal to consider the length of time spent in Australia when deciding if they would cancel a visa. Known as ministerial direction 99, it was issued on January 23, 2023, to assuage long-held concerns from the New Zealand government that its citizens were being deported in high numbers even when they had stronger ties to Australia than NZ. Home Affairs’ latest visa cancellation statistics show that, as of December 31, there was a significant reduction of visa cancellations on character grounds – particularly for New Zealanders – in the first six months of the 2023-24 financial year. Home Affairs is yet to clarify the role of direction 99 in those statistics. Former top immigration official Abul Rizvi said the direction would have influenced the drop in numbers, adding he viewed it as a correction to the policy under the Coalition, which cancelled 1015 visas on character grounds in 2019-20, of which 50 per cent were New Zealanders. That number dropped to 244 in the six months to December. Loading “I think what had happened under the Morrison government was a pretty extreme position,” he said. “If a person has grown up in Australia as a young child, it’s much harder to argue someone else should take them.” Official figures also show the number of people in immigration detention on character grounds has fallen steadily since early 2022. Following reporting by The Australian that the direction was used in determining a New Zealand child rapist should stay in Australia, opposition immigration spokesman Dan Tehan told reporters in Canberra on Monday the Coalition would scrap direction 99 if returned to government. “I don’t think that you could get a worse example that ministerial direction is clearly failing and that is why it needs to be rescinded,” he said. with AAP Cut through the noise of federal politics with news, views and expert analysis.

Live stream: DirecTV Stream Here’s a recent MLB story from the AP: ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list on Monday after the reigning NL MVP suffered a season-ending torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. Acuña suffered the injury in the Braves’ 8-1 win at the Pittsburgh Pirates on Sunday. After opening the game with a double, Acuña started toward third on a stolen base attempt. His left knee gave way when he stopped in an attempt to return to second base. The Braves announced Sunday night that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery. This is Acuña’s second season-ending knee injury. He tore his right ACL on July 20, 2021 . Acuña was named the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases, becoming the first player to have at least 40 homers and 70 steals in a season. The 26-year-old from Venezuela was hitting .250 with four homers, 15 RBIs and 16 steals this season. The Braves recalled outfielder J.P. Martinez from Triple-A Gwinnett and infielder Joey Wendle was designated for assignment. Catcher Sean Murphy, who suffered a strained left oblique muscle on March 30, was activated from the injured list.

        "description": "The new midwifery role at Dr Gray’s Hospital knits together in-person care and digital skills.",
        "content": "NHS Grampian has welcomed a new midwife to Dr Gray’s Hospital as part of the plans to return maternity services to Moray. Debbie McWilliam begun a new joint role at Dr Gray’s Hospital in Elgin in April, which will see her having time dedicated to digital projects as well as working on the ward. Debbie is passionate about putting women and families’ experiences at the heart of improving service delivery. She has led several quality improvement projects already and plans to use data collection and analysis to inform the way services, as well as midwifery education, are improved across Grampian. She said: “We’re streamlining digital services for women, for staff and for quality improvement and risk management purposes. This will help us provide seamless, multi-disciplinary and collaborative care, not only between our sites within NHS Grampian but also with our NHS Highland colleagues as well. “My post came about as part of the Maternity Collaborative between NHS Grampian and NHS Highland, and I’m part of a data and digital workstream alongside colleagues who work in both areas. I also teach knitting and crocheting locally and it’s not too different to that – as we pull together different threads, build up a picture and learn from each other. Teamwork is a valuable aspect of midwifery as we all work collaboratively to provide the very best care we can to families.” Debbie qualified as a midwife in 2010, worked in Australia for a year and gained her neonatal nursing qualification in 2015, after 17 years in banking. She was inspired to join the profession by the midwifery team in Elgin. “The team in Ward 3 and in the community made me want to be a midwife as they supported me so much when I was having my own kids. I am delighted to be part of that amazing team with some great colleagues and friends,” she explained. Debbie was “born and bred” in the North of Scotland, settled in Elgin in 1993 and now has two grown up children. She says she loves living in Elgin, which is “perfectly placed” for exploring the hills, coast and forest trails. She added: “One of my favourite things is discovering new walking trails and I’m currently on a mission to find all the Ordnance Survey Trig points in Moray and Nairn. I’m also grateful for the community spirit we have here and I enjoy teaching knitting and crocheting. I really love watching women make time for themselves and learn a new skill.”",

        "content": "“Bob Marley: One Love” was one of eight films nominated in the “Best Picture” category for the 2024 BET Awards. The biographical Marley film was released in theaters on February 14, 2024, and took in $51 million in its opening. Award winners will be announced on BET in a live presentation ceremony on June 30, 2024. The film’s story and reception The film follows Marley and his band, The Wailers, during the period in which they recorded their 1977 album, “Exodus” and performed at the One Love Concert. Directed by Reinaldo Marcus Green, the film stars Kingsley Ben Adir as Marley and Lashawna Lynch as his wife, Rita. According to Billboard magazine, the movie ranks as the fifth highest-grossing cinema music biography in history, and BoxOfficeMojo, a US website that measures box-office revenue, determined it had grossed nearly $97 million in the United States and just over $177 million globally as of May 2024. The film also attained a 92-percent audience approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes, a film and television review website. BET and the awards program Black Entertainment Television (BET), the first television network targeting Black audiences in the US, launched in 1980 under the leadership of Robert L. Johnson, who previously served as a lobbyist for the cable industry. The network is currently owned by Paramount Global via the CBS Entertainment Group and by 2015 was received in almost 76 percent of households that have television. The BET Awards, tagged as “Culture’s Biggest Night,” were established in 2001 to celebrate Black and other minority entertainers in film, music, sports, and philanthropy. BET has stated that in 2024 the awards will include more international and emerging performers. Voting for the Viewer’s Choice Award is slated to start in June 6, 2024. The other films nominated for “Best Picture” include “American Fiction,” “Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé,” “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” The Book of Clarence,” The Color Purple,” “The Equalizer 3,” and “The Little Mermaid.” Photos – Paramount Pictures",

Live Stream: DirecTV Stream (free trial), fuboTV (free trial) or Sling ($25 off any package for the first month or a three-month subscription for just $90) Here’s a recent NBA story from the AP: NEW YORK (AP) — LeBron James is now the youngest — and the oldest — player to make an All-NBA team. And Dallas’ Luka Doncic and Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander are in position to make around $1 million per game a few years from now. Denver’s Nikola Jokic and Gilgeous-Alexander were the only unanimous first-team selections on this season’s All-NBA team, which was revealed by the league on Wednesday night. They were joined on the first team by Doncic, Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo and Boston’s Jayson Tatum. On the second team: New York’s Jalen Brunson, Minnesota’s Anthony Edwards, Phoenix’s Kevin Durant, the Los Angeles Clippers’ Kawhi Leonard and James’ Los Angeles Lakers teammate, Anthony Davis. The third team had James, Golden State’s Stephen Curry, Sacramento’s Domantas Sabonis, Indiana’s Tyrese Haliburton and Phoenix’s Devin Booker. The NBA changed the rules starting with this season and All-NBA voting is now positionless — as opposed to having two guards, two forwards and one center on each of the teams, a formula that had been in place since the 1950s. Players also had to appear in a minimum number of games, in most cases, to be eligible for award consideration from the panel of 99 broadcasters and writers who served as the voting panel. For James, who was the youngest player to make All-NBA when he was voted onto the team for the 2004-05 season, another selection only added to his list of accomplishments. The 20 All-NBA overall picks extended his record, a total that’s now five more than Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. His 20 consecutive selections is obviously another record, and he’s the first player to be age 39 or older during what became an All-NBA regular season. Abdul-Jabbar and Duncan were both just a few days from turning 39 when the regular seasons ended in what became their final All-NBA campaigns, Abdul-Jabbar’s being 1985-86 and Duncan’s being 2014-15. James — the NBA’s career scoring leader — played in 71 games this season, the last 42 of those coming after he turned 39. And for Doncic and Gilgeous-Alexander, the All-NBA nods mean they are poised for supermax extensions that can be signed in 2025, both of which would set records. Doncic can sign a five-year deal worth about $347 million, starting at nearly $60 million in 2026-27 and ending at about $79 million in 2030-31. Gilgeous-Alexander will be eligible to sign a four-year extension worth about $294 million. His would start in 2027-28 at around $65 million — and the final year, 2030-31, would see him earning just over $81 million, or nearly $1 million per game. It would be the first time an NBA player’s annual salary has topped $80 million. Also seeing major financial boosts from their All-NBA selections were Edwards and Haliburton, both of whom agreed to extensions last summer that were to be worth about $205 million — and now will be worth about $245 million over the next five seasons. Durant made All-NBA for the 11th time, tying for the 12th-most in NBA history. MORE SPORTS COVERAGE Thank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

        "content": "Organisers of this year’s Inverness Loch Ness Classic and Vintage Car Tour say the door is still open for late entries ahead of its return this Saturday. The non-competitive event, held by the Rotary Club of Inverness Loch Ness, is set to welcome owners of classic cars and vintage sports vehicles for a 160-mile tour of roads across the north. Co-organiser Ormond Smith said: “We’ve lost about three of four entries thanks to a certain concert in Edinburgh held by one Taylor Swift. A few are dragging their kids off to see the concert, but having said that we have three or four new entries, so one compensates the other. “We had set a deadline for our entry list, but we’re happy to extend the date for late entries. We are hoping that we may attract a few more as it’s all money to charities at the end of the day.” Classic Car Tours in the north and organisers from the Rotary Club of Inverness Loch Ness are looking forward to greeting entries from many parts of Scotland for this one day event. The tour is being held to raise funds for two local charities as its principal recipients this year — CHAS (Children’s Hospices Across Scotland) and Highlands and Islands Blood Bikes. Mr Smith added: “What we decided back in 2017 was to concentrate on local, or local branches of charities who will benefit directly from funds raised. We have supported CHAS in the past, but this year we are also supporting Highland and Islands Blood Bikes, who do a very worthwhile job in the region.” The route for the 2024 event takes in Nairnshire, Speyside and Glenlivet, returning to the Inverness Ice Centre base via Strathnairn and Loch Ness side, covering around 160 miles on A and B class roads. Among the cars already entered are a 1950’s Austin A105 Vanden Plas, a Morris 1000 Van — also from the ‘50’s — and evocative sports cars of the 1960’s like the Lotus Elan and the mighty Austin Healey 3000, and a rare Bristol 412 model of which only 97 were ever built. Full information including and entry form can be obtained from the Tour website or from event organiser Nicol Manson on 07774 695640 (before 8pm) or by email to nicol.manson@btinternet.com. Cars can be viewed prior to the start at Inverness Ice Centre before the 10am start and again in the afternoon as the entries arrive back at the Tour finish around 4pm.",

        "description": "All councils have to review representation every six years. Now it's Wairoa's turn.",
        "content": "The Wairoa District Council, which was the first council in Hawke’s Bay to include a Māori ward , has begun its obligatory representation review which will decide how the currently six-member council will look at the next two local elections. The reviews are required to be carried out by all councils every six years, and will decided whether the 2025 and 2028 elections will see any change from the current structure of a mayor and two wards – a general ward and a Māori ward each with three councillors at the table. Councillors can be elected from wards (including district-wide), “at large” (by all electors in the district, irrespective of whether they are on the general or Māori roll), or by a mixture, and a key consideration is whether the number of councillors should increase, or whether there should be any community boards for specific areas of the district or council operation. The options are retaining the current structure, or expanding to eight councillors with one district-wide Maori ward (four councillors) and one district-wide general ward (four councillors), or one district-wide Maori ward (three councillors), one district-wide general ward (three councillors) and two councillors elected at-large by all voters. Ultimately sanctioned by the Local Government Commission, representation arrangements need to be fair, effective, and representative. Geographic wards should be divided so that each councillor represents roughly the same number of people while ensuring communities of interest, such as urban, rural, isolated, or centralised, are represented. The council is seeking early feedback on how many councillors there should be, whether they are elected from wards or return to the previous district-wide election or a combination of both, whether the district should have any community boards, and how general and Māori wards would be framed. It will help the council determine a preferred option which will go to public consultation in the district in July-August. There are currently no community boards in a district which at the last election in 2022 had seven candidates in the general ward and six in the Māori ward, and when 51.5 per cent of the 5563 on the rolls voted. In a referendum at the 2016 local elections, there was 45 per cent voter support for the establishment of Māori wards for the elections in 2019 and 2022. Of other councils in Hawke’s Bay, the Hawke’s Bay Regional Council and the Hastings and Tararua district councils introduced Māori wards in 2022, after the need for a referendum was withdrawn by a 2021 change of legislation. Napier and Central Hawke’s Bay have decided on incorporation of Māori wards at the next elections and are currently going through of how they will appear in their representation, but a bill now before Parliament could bring back referenda if required.

        "content": "The (ASX: XJO) share ( ) is a stalwart in my portfolio, and I expect to own it for the rest of my life. Soul Patts is an investment house that has been listed since 1903, making it one of the oldest companies on the ASX. It started as a chemist with 21 pharmacy stores, but it's now a very different business. Incredibly, Soul Patts has been managed by the same family from the start – Robert Millner is the fourth generation of the family to chair the company. Being old doesn't automatically make it a compelling investment, though longevity is a useful characteristic for a long-term investment. It means I can confidently hold the ASX 200 share for a long time. Three factors really matter to me about this business. is appealing because it lowers the risk to the Soul Patts portfolio if a particular investment goes wrong. The portfolio is invested in multiple industries and asset classes, including ASX shares, ASX shares, private businesses, property, and credit/ . In terms of individual ASX companies, some of its main investments include ( ), ( ), ( ), ( ), ( ), ( ), ( ), ( ) and ( ). Other areas it's invested in include agriculture, resources, financial services, retirement living, swimming schools, electrification and more. I like that the business has the flexibility to invest almost anywhere, opening up lots of opportunities for the company to find the best investment. One of the most substantial financial moves that can help an ASX 200 share deliver long-term returns is the re-investment of profit back into itself for more growth. With Soul Patts, there's a double layer of re-investment occuring. The investment house's portfolio of companies are re-investing inside their own businesses. Soul Patts doesn't need to do anything for Wesfarmers, Goodman and Brickworks to invest in and grow their operations. On top of that, Soul Patts receives dividends and distributions from its portfolio of assets. After paying for its costs and sending a majority of the net to shareholders as a dividend, Soul Patts re-invests some of that cash flow into more opportunities, adding more financial power to the snowballing effect of growth. The ASX 200 share has grown its annual ordinary every year since 2000, the longest streak of consecutive dividend increases on the ASX. Dividend hikes aren't guaranteed, but it's nice to know that there's a good chance next year's dividend payment will be larger than this year's. In the , Soul Patts increased its interim payout by 11.1% after its net cash flow from investments increased by 6.9%. It currently has a grossed-up dividend yield of around 4%. I like that I can own Soul Patts shares and receive dividends, meaning I don't need to sell shares to capitalise on the growth it's generating.",

        "content": "In Fort Thomas where North Fort Thomas Avenue, Waterworks Road and Burnet Ridge come together, you may notice a bronze statue of a little girl reading a book. While it’s a pretty addition to a small garden created on the median by the Fort Thomas Garden Club, there is more to the story. The bronze statue honors Amy Head Fennell, a longtime Fort Thomas resident and past president of the garden club who passed away in 2021. Fennell grew up in the city and raised her family there. She attended Fort Thomas schools and graduated from Highlands High before earning a degree from the University of Kentucky College of Design. After establishing a career at design agencies in the region, she opened her own business, Ahead Design, in the city. Fennell’s husband, Bill “Frell” Fennell, said he and Amy grew up very near each other in Fort Thomas. Their parents were friends and had a tight and active social circle. The children grew up playing together and spending summers together, including trips to Florida for spring break. Get the morning's headlines right to your inbox with our newsletters Every Weekday Morning (The Daily LINK) Saturday Morning (The Weekend LINK) The families spent those summers in what Fennell calls “old Florida” before the building boom of condos and businesses in the 1980s and ‘90s. “We had a really cool place. It was 1,500 feet of beach. It was kind of like the old Dirty Dancing type of resort. It was one large cabin and four or five small cabins. They chopped it all up between parents and kids. It was under the Florida pines, so you could get out of the sun. You could have a fire on the beach every night...We just had the time of our lives.” said Fennell. Fennell said he went to college at UK as well, and love blossomed between the two longtime friends. The pair married and established their own home in Fort Thomas and raised their sons there. Although she stayed in her hometown, Frell Fennell said his wife had a creative mindset and talent that sometimes took her far from home. She worked on projects throughout the Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky region, but her work also took her to Tennessee, Florida, New York and North Carolina. She designed homes, condos, restaurants and boutique hotels. She was always up for a challenge, he said. “She always did things that everybody said, ‘You can’t do that.’ She once accessorized an entire condominium in Ashville in one day including driving down and back. It was an empty industrial building with exposed brick and drywall...She installed all the furniture, window treatments, pictures on the wall, made the beds with sheets, lamps, books, everything, so it was ready to live in. It was just crazy,” said Fennell. Amy Fennell was an active community volunteer throughout her life, often drawing on her design and business skills in support of area schools and other projects in the city, said her husband. “She was always giving back, doing something for someone else,” he said. When their sons were in school, she volunteered to chair fundraising events. At Johnson, she volunteered for the school’s annual Hullabaloo fundraiser and later served as chair. While the record for earnings for the event had been around $25,000, as chair Fennell more than doubled the proceeds. “She was very talented and creative...and she always accepted a challenge by going the extra mile,” Fennell said. When their sons reached high school, Amy Fennell turned her attention to supporting her alma mater, where she served on and chaired committees to raise funds for sports teams and other school needs. It was this spirit of giving back, especially to the area schools, that the garden club wanted to celebrate with the little statue, said current club president Lori Wendling, a close friend of Fennell. “Amy was a lifelong member and a generational member of the garden club of Fort Thomas. After she passed, many friends donated to the garden club in her honor. It was decided that a permanent statue of the young girl reading a book would be the perfect memorial,” Wendling said. She said the location, near Johnson School, seemed fitting since Fennell supported the school in many ways for many years. “We chose that because Amy had a very strong connection to Johnson. She went there as a child. She’s always lived right in that community area. It was her home school. It was the elementary school for her kids. And she volunteered there a ton. And we thought, you know, that’d be a good memory,” said Wendling. Wendling and another club member Alison Murphy, owner of Branch Out Design, worked on the project and oversaw the purchase and installation of the statue. They planted rose bushes and a variety of pink flowers around it. Fennell’s friends and family wanted something permanent and something that would reflect her lifelong connection to the community.

        "content": "“Xavi will leave the club at the end of the season.” This is a sentence that would’ve made no sense last year, perfect sense three months ago, no sense again three weeks ago and three days ago would’ve felt inevitable. Feels like some sort of twisted riddle? Ask any Barcelona fan how this season has gone. The die has now been officially cast, and after the most tumultuous, topsy-turvy campaign in recent memory, culminating in arguably the craziest managerial saga of all time, the footballing legend that is Xavi Hernandez has been sacked. He will be replaced by Hansi Flick, whose CV includes becoming the second manager ever (we know the first) to win six trophies in a single season with Bayern. As far as the result, it must be said that this story did not end poorly for either party. Xavi performed a very commendable (and often under-appreciated) job in taking a beleaguered, dysfunctional Barca side languishing in ninth and rediscovering its identity. But at the same time, this past season has made it fairly clear that as much as he bleeds Blaugrana, he is probably not the man to take us to the next level, and while Flick is certainly a risk, we can be cautiously optimistic that he is an upgrade. Photo by Joan Valls/Urbanandsport /NurPhoto via Getty Images And for Xavi, he made it clear when announcing his departure in January that he is tired; he used phrases like “cruel and unpleasant” and cited mental health concerns, so he now gets some well-deserved rest and relaxation. Further down the line, maybe he finds his way home again. So all in all, Xavi’s departure and Flick’s impending arrival weren’t the worst case scenario by any means. With that said, the circumstances behind Xavi’s departure, the decision-making from top to bottom, and most importantly, the direction from the head of the snake, club president Joan Laporta, absolutely were. When Xavi first announced his departure in January following a shocking 5-3 defeat to Villareal, Laporta trusted Xavi’s decision was for the best because “he is an honest person, and he is a person who loves Barca”. And yet, Barca’s form took a turn for the better. Ten wins and 13 games unbeaten followed Xavi’s announcement, including an impressive quarter-final victory against PSG, as Laporta began working both publicly and privately to convince his manager to stay. Ultimately, though, this season was defined by a few key games where Barcelona capitulated under pressure, none worse than Ronald Araujo’s red card in the second leg against PSG. Nonetheless, recognizing strong improvement in 2024, Xavi announced shortly after that he’d be staying on for another year. Laporta was seemingly over the moon with what he called great news, expressing that Barca had no other talks with other managers, rather just “waiting for Xavi to change his mind”. But then came trouble. Photo by PIERRE-PHILIPPE MARCOU/AFP via Getty Images The infamous press conference occurred following an uneventful win against Almeria in May. Xavi said: “We are going to try to compete [with Madrid]. The fans understand that the economic situation is very difficult. We are not in the same conditions as other clubs that have far more favorable Financial Fair Play conditions. The fans must understand that we need time, but this does not mean that we are not looking to compete and fight for titles, we will do our best to try and compete.” And Laporta exploded. Reports came out immediately after that Laporta was furious, that he felt personally betrayed by Xavi, and that his continuation at Barca was no longer assured. Laporta began to negotiate with other managers, Flick included, without telling Xavi a word. In other words, Xavi was receiving information about his future the same way as everybody else: from Gerard Romero, Toni Juanmarti, and journalists like us. For all the talk of what a legend Xavi is, how he has always acted honestly and put the club first, etc. Laporta didn’t even do him the courtesy of a phone call asking him to explain his words. Xavi didn’t say anything incendiary, he clearly didn’t blame Laporta for anything, and most importantly, he didn’t say anything that even the least involved of Barca fans don’t already know: the economic situation is messed up. Maybe one could argue his comments were slightly pessimistic and not motivational. Did they need to be said? No. But were they bad enough to elicit a complete reversal from the man that publicly petitioned for him to stay? In the words of the great Jordan Belfort, absolutely f****** not. Laporta’s response is truly baffling: to ultimately sack him over these comments defies all logic and reason. About two weeks, and only three matches, passed between when Xavi announced he was staying and when the rumors came out that Laporta wanted him gone, but the season was basically over at that point anyway so a footballistic decision wouldn’t make sense in this timeframe. The Vitor Roque drama could have been a factor, but again, it’s hard to believe Xavi would be sacked over one player: there has to be more to the story. We arrive at a more challenging supposition, because what else defies all logic and reason? Ego. Laporta has always been as charismatic as he is enigmatic, and in his first stint with the club, history mainly saw the best of him: presiding over arguably the greatest team of all time (with Xavi as a staple) made results speak for themselves. Photo credit should read LLUIS GENE/AFP via Getty Images But what is often glossed over is that just before he made the life-changing decision to promote the Barca B manager in 2008, he had faced a vote of no confidence where over 60% of socios called for his dismissal (just below the two-thirds majority needed), and following the vote, eight members of his board resigned in protest. In 2005 he had also seen five board members, including his eventual successor Sandro Rosell, leave their post, reportedly calling Laporta a megalomaniac. While we should of course take anything Rosell says with a pinch of salt (his two years in jail on corruption charges dictate that), it remains true that Barcelona’s success in the latter half of his presidency papered over the cracks of some pretty heavy criticism leveled at Laporta. His second stint the club has been different; after being financially and morally bankrupted in large part by former president Josep Maria Bartomeu, Laporta inherited a Barcelona that was in shambles, and to his credit has taken it quite far. He is a successful lawyer, businessman, and politician, but every so often, the ego rears its ugly head. The way that Xavi, a true legend of the game and faithful servant of our club, has been treated these past few weeks has been nothing short of disgraceful. As a player, he left when he could no longer give his best to Barca, and as a manager he promised to do the same, hence why he announced his departure initially. Photo by Eric Alonso/Getty Images It’s no secret that Xavi should’ve done better with the squad at his disposal this season, but he was the first to take responsibility: he resigned, so Mr. Laporta, accept it and move on. Flick was available then, too. The million-dollar question remains, why would he beg Xavi to stay just to fire him? This is where the ego comes into play again. For Laporta, it is not the same look whether Xavi resigns or gets fired. One is a situation of control, while the other may feel like his employees are making decisions without his involvement. As far-fetched as this troubling theory may initially sound, there are more examples that support it. Starting with the most famous case, Messi wanted to leave Barca in 2020, but Bartomeu slammed the door in his face, and eventually he agreed to stay for one more season. When Laporta took over in early 2021, he pushed for months for Messi to reconsider, and once the Argentine finally did, Laporta independently announced that Messi had to leave. Sound familiar? Photo by PAU BARRENA/AFP via Getty Images After the various economic levers he pulled to sign a 35-year-old Robert Lewandowski on a high salary, among others, Laporta cannot hide behind the financial situation for the Messi saga. Gerard Pique left on bad terms with Laporta in the middle of the following season, too: how many club legends, especially Masia products, leave their teams in January? And while his sacking was deserved, what about Ronald Koeman, another legend that Laporta dragged through the mud? The last and most curious example is that of former sporting director Mateu Alemany, who is very highly regarded by all for his stellar work amid the financial crisis. He announced in May 2023 that he would leave at the end of the season, and he, too, was convinced by Laporta to stay. However, in August Laporta gave his friend and Raphinha’s agent Deco (with zero experience as a director, having simply facilitated this one transfer) full control of the sporting department, Alemany’s area of expertise, without negotiating at all or even informing him beforehand. Again, sound familiar? In every single one of these cases, Laporta faced the voluntary departure of important people within Barca and convinced them to stay, only to then unilaterally decide not to keep them. It could be to boost his image for the fans, to exemplify his role as an authority figure or any number of possible reasons, but the pattern is clear. It’s obviously not proof of anything, but it’s certainly not negligible either and not small enough to ignore. Equally striking is that he replaced Messi as the figurehead and major attraction at the club with Lewandowski, the client of super agent and close friend Pini Zahavi. He replaced Alemany with Deco, a friend and former player from his first stint as president. He then used his friendship with another super agent, Jorge Mendes, to sign Joao Felix and Joao Cancelo on loan, and despite neither of them doing anywhere near enough to justify a permanent transfer, there are concerns he will attempt to negotiate out of goodwill to Mendes, who also represents Alejandro Balde and Lamine Yamal. And now, he has replaced Xavi with Flick, client of who? Pini Zahavi. His backup option? Rafa Marquez, friend of both Deco and him, manager of the B team and a clear downgrade from Xavi. Photo by Alex Caparros/Getty Images Laporta has manipulated the exits of several notable club members to give himself the decision-making power, and each time has replaced them with friends or like-minded associates. These are two separate ideas, but they are interconnected: they both reek of an authoritarian leader, and with Laporta’s past, the accusation is not unjustified. The Barca president has managed to surround himself with an inner circle that largely consists of people he has pre-existing relationships with, which diminishes his sense of accountability and provides significant free reign in his direction of Barcelona, which has always prided itself on its democratic values. On top of that, he has shown no remorse, regard, or loyalty towards even the most important members of the club. He has been successful in many ways as president, but there are very worrying signs that key decisions of his are driven by his ego and desire for control, which could well come back to bite Barca one day. Xavi is just the latest example, but Laporta has burned a lot of bridges at the club, from players to managers and even directors, and all the stories seemingly come back to one simple, critical note: he can’t be trusted.",

        "content": "Tech stocks have been the needle-mover of the economy for the last two decades. Most can’t argue that the stock market has been supercharged by the sheer dominance of tech companies over this time frame. Calls for a bubble are proliferating, but I do not think we are in a tech bubble right now. The average person spends a significant amount of their time online, and that’s not going to change. So, it’s likely going to be a smart idea to continue buying tech stocks over time. These companies are simply much more likely to increase in value over the long-run, as key catalysts such as AI become ubiquitous. Funnily enough, you could search up almost any company right now in any sector (even agriculture), and more likely than not, you’ll hear their management team tout how they use AI. In my opinion, the tech revolution is far from over, as this is one of the mega trends I think can take the entire tech sector higher over time. This article isn’t going to be an AI pure-play article, though. I will focus more on tech startups with solid growth and a clear path to profits. Here are three tech stocks to consider that you likely haven’t heard of before. M-Tron Industries (MPTI) M-Tron Industries (NYSEMKT: MPTI ) is a drone technology company operating in the aerospace and defense sectors. This is a company that I’ve long believed has strong potential for significant growth in the coming years. In Q4 2023, M-Tron posted impressive 29% year-over-year revenue growth to $41.2 million . That’s outstanding, and is the kind of growth many tech investors are looking for. However, what really stood out to me is the company’s increasingly profitable business model. M-Tron’s gross profit margin jumped from 35.6% to 40.7% as the company benefited from higher sales volumes and an improved mix of products. And if you exclude a one-time stock compensation expense, their operating profit margin would have reached 14.6% compared to just 9.1% the prior year. That level of improved operational efficiency can really accelerate earnings growth over the long-term. Notably, M-Tron also has a solid order backlog of $47.8 million on its books, up 3.6% from 2022, and an order filling rate above 1-times. In my view, this shows the company has both near-term revenue visibility and ample potential for continued business expansion. The cash flow growth here is also solid. With M-Tron making smart financial investments in research and development, talent recruitment, and equipment upgrades, I expect its profitability to keep increasing over time. I believe MPTI stock is a hidden gem that is well-positioned to significantly increase in value. Turtle Beach (HEAR) Turtle Beach (NASDAQ: HEAR ) is a company in the gaming accessory industry that seems to be flying under the radar currently. However, this is also a company that appears poised for tremendous growth over time. Even though the stock is up nearly 133% from its trough in 2022, I think this smaller company has the opportunity to potentially see its stock price quadruple over the next two years alone. That’s partly due to Turtle Beach’s very impressive financial performance in Q1. The company reported an 8.6% increase in revenue to $55.9 million . The company also moved into the green, providing $1.4 million in adjusted EBITDA. That’s a stark reversal from the $2.8 million loss in EBITDA they experienced in the same period last year. However, perhaps even more notable is that the overall gaming headsets and controllers markets saw double-digit growth during this time. Accordingly, this company seems well-positioned to capitalize on this momentum, as they are launching a whole new lineup of products in the very near future. The company’s Stealth Ultra controller and VelocityOne simulation gear appear to be fueling gains in HEAR’s market share. For example, their portion of the flight simulation market increased from 20% to 25% over the past year alone. Analysts expect nearly 30% annual earnings per share growth over the next two years. In my view, HEAR stock is definitely one of the top tech plays in the market right now. Intellicheck (IDN) Intellicheck (NASDAQ: IDN ) is an identity verification company that I believe has great growth potential over the next few years. In Q1, the company was able to deliver solid results for adjusted EBITDA (though it was still slightly in the red), and Intellicheck’s management team continued to increase recurring software revenue over the previous 12-month period. Given the company’s current growth trajectory and profitability targets, management expects that by the end of 2024, Intellicheck will achieve positive net income and adjusted EBITDA. The size of the market opportunity Intellicheck addresses is huge. According to a report from Javelin Research , losses from identity theft increased 13% to $23 billion in 2023. Intellicheck’s innovative identity authentication solutions are perfectly suited to help businesses protect their customers without adding unnecessary hassles. Despite the company’s massive growth opportunity (especially in their finance segment), IDN stock currently trades around $3 per share. That translates into only 2.7-times forward sales, as of writing. In my view, that’s dirt cheap for a company that has the potential to surpass the $12 level by 2026. This is one company worth watching closely. On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Sciatica is a condition that causes nerve irritation. It usually affects one side, starting from the lower back or bottom and spreading down one leg. Symptoms of sciatica include shooting pain that starts in your lower back or bottom and runs down the back of your leg, often to your foot and toes. Common treatments for sciatica include exercises and stretches. Other treatments like injections or surgery may help if it does not get better. Sciatica can occur when something presses or rubs on the sciatic nerve. The most common cause is a slipped disc in your spine. Tyson retired from boxing in 2005 due to a back issue, while he also struggled with a knee injury late in his career. He revealed sciatica, which is a condition that causes nerve irritation, is the only health issue he suffers with. Despite that, he still thinks about his own mortality, saying on his podcast: \"We’re all gonna die one day of course. Then, when I look in the mirror, I see those little spots on my face. \"I say, 'Wow. That means my expiration date is coming close, really soon.'\"",

        "content": "Bill Walton , two-time NBA champion and Hall of Famer who went on to become an Emmy-winning broadcaster for ESPN and other networks, died Monday following a lengthy battle with cancer, the league announced. He was 71. “Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,” NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. “As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. Related Stories News Hollywood & Media Deaths In 2024: Photo Gallery & Obituaries News Johnny Wactor Dies: ‘General Hospital’ & ‘Siberia’ Actor Was 37 “Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton famously played for coach John Wooden and the UCLA Bruins, leading UCLA to NCAA championships in 1972 and 1973, along with an 88-game winning streak. In the 1973 NCAA title game between UCLA and Memphis, Walton shot a remarkable 21 for 22 from the field. He also won three consecutive national college player of the year awards from 1972-1974. As the first overall pick in the 1974 NBA draft, Walton was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers, leading the team to an NBA championship in 1977, and earning the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award that same season. He went on to win another NBC title in 1986 with the Boston Celtics. He also played for the San Diego and eventually LA Clippers. After retiring from the NBA, Walton moved on to a second career as a sportscaster, working both as a studio analyst and color commentator at several networks and teams. He earned an Emmy Award for his work in 1991. He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993. Walton joined ESPN in 2002 after 12 years at NBC as a lead analyst for NBA games, later shifting to college basketball in 2012. He was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all-time by the American Sportscasters Association in 2009. DEADLINE RELATED VIDEO:",

        "description": "TORONTO - Toronto FC fullback/wingback Richie Laryea, sidelined by a hamstring injury since the Feb. 25 season opener, is expected to return to action...",
        "content": "TORONTO — Toronto FC fullback/wingback Richie Laryea, sidelined by a hamstring injury since the Feb. 25 season opener, is expected to return to action Saturday at D.C. United. Coach John Herdman said Laryea will travel with the MLS team for Wednesday’s game in Philadelphia but won’t take the field until Saturday. With two away games this week, Toronto plans to stay south of the border after the mid-week game. Laryea, one of Toronto’s designated players along with Italian stars Lorenzo Insigne and Federico Bernardeschi, underwent surgery March 23 in London, England. At the time, his recovery time was said to be three months. Herdman said Laryea won’t be on the active roster for the Philadelphia game. “The expectation is Richie will play minutes against D.C. United,” Herdman said after training Monday. “That’s been the plan, so this week he’s ramping up. He’ll hit all his sort of final check boxes and put a real intense training week in but will travel with the team so he’s ready to go against D.C.” The 29-year-old Laryea and TFC captain Jonathan Osorio were included Monday in Jesse Marsch’s first roster selection as Canada coach for friendlies June 6 and 9 against the Netherlands and France. “I’m proud for those lads,” said Herdman, who stepped down in August as Canada coach to take over Toronto. “I know what it means to them to represent their country. “Richie’s had a tough run so I’m pleased Jesse put the trust in him, because he’s a guy who loves playing for Canada. He gives his everything and I’ve seen him reach special levels in that Canadian jersey. While he plays in MLS, when he plays for Canada he’s able to show he’s got world-class ability. And I’d say the same for Osorio.” While Toronto does not have any games scheduled while Laryea and Osorio are away for the friendlies, Herdman will feel the pain during Copa America, which runs June 20 to July 24. “(Copa America) comes at time for us in June where you’d love to have had that full squad available,” he said. “But having been the guy that took players away from MLS clubs and not worry too much about it, being on the other end you’ve just got to pat these boys on the back and wish them all the best.” Laryea, who has 48 caps, last played for Canada in November’s CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinal series against Jamaica. Osorio has 71 caps. Rookie wingback Tyrese Spicer, who came off in the 58th minute of Saturday’s 4-3 loss to visiting FC Cincinnati, is questionable for Wednesday’s game with a gastrointestinal issue. “We’re just learning whether it’s muscular or something different,” Herdman said. Forward Prince Owusu is being monitored for a tight calf. Midfielder Brandon Servania (knee) and defender Shane O’Neil (thigh) remain on the injured list. Bernardeschi returns this week after missing the Cincinnati game due to yellow card accumulation. Toronto (7-7-1) goes into mid-week play in sixth place in the Eastern Conference, two places and four points ahead of Philadelphia (4-4-6). TFC has won just one of its last four league matches (1-0-3). But it has won seven of its last 10 (7-3-0) in all competitions. — Follow @NeilMDavidson on X platform, formerly known as Twitter This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024 Neil Davidson, The Canadian Press",

        "content": "Boston Celtics legend and two-time NBA champion and Hall of Famer Bill Walton died of cancer at the age of 71, the NBA announced Monday. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. \"As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams.\" Walton had a prolonged fight with cancer. Walton was a beloved member of the Celtics from the moment he was traded to the team from the Los Angeles Clippers in 1985. In his first time in a Celtics uniform in the Boston Garden, Walton received a one-minute standing ovation from the Boston home crowd walking onto the court for his first exhibition game in 1985. Walton won an NBA title in 1986 as a member of the Celtics. Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, San Diego and eventually the Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Walton may best be remembered by younger fans for his broadcasting work during NBA games. \"Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans,\" Silver said in a statement.

North West's role in The Lion King has been criticised, but she's the latest in a long line of stars who got a leg up from their famous relatives North played Young Simba during The Lion King's 30th Anniversary concert READ MORE: North West's Lion King performance faces harsh criticism online By Gina Kalsi and Jessica Taylor For Mailonline Published: 15:47, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 18:58, 27 May 2024 e-mail 36 View comments Kim Kardashian and Kanye West 's daughter North has faced harsh criticism online following acting debut, with some slamming the 'nepo baby' advantage she's benefitted from. North played Young Simba during The Lion King's 30th Anniversary concert on Friday and took to the stage at The Hollywood Bowl to perform I Just Can't Wait To Be King. North joined other stars on the stage, such as Jennifer Hudson , Billy Eichner, Bradley Gibson, Ernie Sabella, Jason Weaver, Jeremy Irons and also Nathan Lane. Despite receiving a standing ovation from the audience, some social media users were less than impressed, with one noting : 'Nepotism is literally the best thing to be born with,' while another added, 'the worst case of nepo I have been witnessed.' North West made her acting debut while performing as Young Simba during The Lion King's 30th Anniversary concert on Friday (seen above) - but online trolls have since lashed out at the ten-year-old's nepo-baby advantage But she is not the only star to have faced criticism for nepotism, as many well-known singers, actresses and models have famous family members. Fans of Emma Roberts may not realise that she is related actress Julia Roberts, known for her roles in Pretty Woman and Notting Hill. Rising star Gracie Abrams - who toured with Taylor Swift and Olivia Rodrigo - has a famous father who directed several Star Wars films. Lottie Moss, the half-sister of Kate Moss, is now a model and faced backlash for hitting back at people calling her a nepo baby in 2022, leading to her deleting her Twitter account. Here, Femail takes a look at other big name stars with famous relatives who have ended up making a names for themselves. Sofia Richie The 25-year-old model is the daughter of Nicole Richie , a reality TV star and designer and singer Lionel Richie . Sofia has been featured in campaigns by a number of major brands including Tommy Hilfiger, Michael Kors, and Adidas. She began modelling in her early teenage years and featured in Teen Vogue at age 14 and got her first contract the following year. She has previously spoken about being a nepo baby to Town & Country and said : 'I spent a lot of time just trying to find my place in the world.

Above: Nicole Richie, Lionel Richie, Sofia Richie and Miles Richie are pictured in 2018 'I think everyone wants to be like their parents when they're growing up, and I admired my dad so much, and that drove me down a music path for a moment. But it didn't feel right for me. 'And then everyone told me, 'You should be an actor!' I tried that for a period, but that wasn't me either. 'I didn't have the experience, and I didn't want to be one of those kid celebrities that got the role because my dad is who he is.' She continued: 'So I was like, 'You know what? I know I'm not cut out for this. Let me just be myself'.' Gracie Abrams The 24-year-old American singer-songwriter is the daughter of J.J. Abrams, a filmmaker who is best known for directing some of the Star Trek and Star Wars films, including The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker. Gracie started her musical journey in 2019, posting covers and original songs on her YouTube channel.

Since then Gracie's career has really picked up, as she opened for for Taylor Swift on the Eras Tour in 2023 and Olivia Rodrigo on her 2022 Sour Tour. Two weeks ago, Gracie revealed the track list for her upcoming album 'The Secret Of Us' on social media. It comes out on June 21 and Swifties lovers will likely be tuning in, as one of the songs, labelled 'Us', features Taylor. Nicolas Cage The 60-year-old actor has been in many films such as Gone in 60 Seconds, Kick Ass and Ghost Rider. He is the son of August Coppola, whose brother is director Francis Ford Coppola . Francis is considered one of the leading figures of Hollywood films in the 1980s and directed iconic movies such as the Godfather and The Great Gatsby (1974). Nicolas Cage is the nephew of Francis Ford Coppola, who directed the Godfather films (both pictured in 2003) Nicolas Cage, Sofia Coppola and Francis Ford Coppola are pictured at an events ceremony in 2004 Nicolas initially studied theatre at Beverly Hills High School before dropping out at 17 years old. He shortly after got a part in Fast Times at Ridgemont High in 1982, but most of his scenes were cut. The star then got a job reading lines with actors auditioning for his uncle's film Rumble Fish in 1983 which landed him a role in that film. He then bagged another role in Valley Girl the same year, which helped Nicolas launch his career. He is also related to Sofia Coppola, an American film director and screenwriter, who is also a nepo baby because of her father Francis. She has worked on films such as Priscilla, Lost in Translation and Marie Antoinette. Matty Healy The lead singer of the band, The 1975 is known for his grungy style and rockstar-esque behaviour. But what many fans may not know is that the 35-year-old is actually a nepo baby, as he is the son of actress and TV personality Denise Welch and actor Tim Healy . Louis Healy, Denise Welch and Matty Healy, are pictured at Octagon Theatre, Bolton, in 2015 Matty Healy is the son of Denise Welch and actor Tim Healy (the family are pictured here with Matty as a child in 1994) Denise is a regular face on the show Loose Women and played Natalie Barnes in Coronation Street . Tim is known for his role as Les and Lesley Conroy in Benidorm and Dennis Patterson in the comedy-drama series Auf Wiedersehen. Last year the singer of the indie band was rumoured to be dating none other than Taylor Swift. But their alleged love soon fizzled out after lasting only two months from April to June last year. Lottie Moss The 26-year-old has broken into the same industry as her half-sister, world-famous British model Kate Moss. Growing up in Haywards Heath in England, Lottie was scouted at just 13 years old after pictures emerged of her at Kate's wedding to Jamie Hince were published in magazines. She said it sounded like a 'fun' and 'exciting' job and so took the opportunity because she wanted to 'make money for myself and for my parents'. Writing for Newsweek , Lottie said: 'I think a common misconception is that because Kate, who is 24 years older than me, is rich and famous, so were my family. Kate Moss and Lottie Moss attend the Topshop Unique show at London Fashion Week at Tate Modern in 2014 The 26-year-old has broken into the same industry as her half-sister, world-famous British model Kate Moss 'But obviously, that was her money and her fame, not ours. 'I honestly think the whole 'nepo baby' concept is so weird; there are so many people in the world that have had obvious advantages in their career because of who they know or who someone in their family is, not just famous people.' In 2022, the model deleted her Twitter account after she was criticised for a series of tweets about nepotism. At the time, she wrote: 'I'm so sick of people blaming nepotism for why they aren't rich and famous or successful – obviously it's not fair that people who come from famous families are getting a leg up because of that but guess what? 'Life isn't fair – if you put your mind to something you can accomplish anything! So instead of being negative about other people's success go and try and create your own!' In the outlet, she also claimed that she never got 'much love or attention' from her older sister Kate which 'upset' her. Lottie added: 'How do I say to people that I don't know her and that she doesn't reply to my texts?' Emma Roberts The 33-year-old actress was a familiar face in many films in the early noughties and 2010s, starring in romantic comedies such as Wild Child and Aquamarine. But many may not know that she is the niece of Hollywood superstar Julia Roberts and daughter of American actor Eric Roberts, who appeared in Suits. Emma Roberts used to watch her aunt Julie Roberts on film sets when she was younger. Above: The pair pictured in 2010 Emma is the daughter of Eric Roberts an actor who appeared in who appeared in Suits. Above: Emma pictured with father Eric and mother Eliza in 2004 Born in New York, Emma spent her childhood on sets of movies with Julia, which initially sparked her interest in acting. Her first movie role came in 2001, where she played the daughter of Johnny Depp 's character in Blow. She has since gone on to star in several films and series such as Scream Queens, American Horror Story, We're the Millers and Nerve. In 2011, she began studying English Literature at Sarah Lawrence College in New York but shortly put her studies on hold due to work commitments. Emma gave birth to her son Rhodes Robert Hedlund with her boyfriend Garrett Hedlund in December 2020. Benedict Cumberbatch Benedict has built up a name for himself as one of the most esteemed British film actors, earning a role as Dr Strange in the Marvel franchise. He also secured a role as the famed detective Sherlock Holmes in a BBC series and featured in the award-winning western The Power of the Dog . However, what many people do not know is that his parents are also huge names in the entertainment industry. His mother Wanda Ventham carved out a successful television career for herself after rising to fame in the 1950s, while his father Timothy Carlton is an actor. Pictured L-R: Wanda Ventham, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tracie Bennett and Timothy Carlton in 2012 Wanda, who married Timothy back in 1976, trained at the Central School of Speech and Drama before going on to star in a host of hit television shows. The actress is best known for portraying Colonel Virginia Lake in the 1970s, while she also secured roles in the original Doctor Who series and Emmerdale Farm. Despite her long list of acting credits, she is very well-recognised for her supporting role in Only Fools and Horses as Del Boy's mother-in-law Pamela Parry. Parents: However, what many people do not know is that his parents Wanda Ventham and Timothy Carlton (pictured) are also huge names in the entertainment industry Meanwhile, Timothy, now 83, was best known for his roles in 1968's mini series Cold Comfort Farm and 1998's Parting Shots. Career: Previously speaking about his upbringing, Benedict said his parents didn't want him to follow in their acting footsteps Wanda Ventham and Timothy Carlton (pictured) are also huge names in the entertainment industry Timothy, was best known for his roles in 1968's mini series Cold Comfort Farm and 1998's Parting Shots Timothy and Wanda even made an appearance in Benedict's smash hit series Sherlock as their son's on-screen parents. Previously speaking about his upbringing, Benedict, 46, said his parents didn't want him to follow in their acting footsteps . He told The Lady magazine in 2019 that his parents 'scrimped and saved' to send him to a prestigious £12,000-a-term Harrow school so he could become 'a doctor or a lawyer'. He explained: 'They scrimped and saved to get their only son the very best education possible. 'And I took that education threw it all in their face and became an actor anyway.' Timothée Chalamet The 28-year-old Wonka star's mother is Nicole Flender, a former Broadway actress and dancer. His uncle Rodman Flender directed Gilmore Girls, Ugly Betty, The Office and 10 Things I Hate About You.

He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in the Drama segement. Jennifer Aniston Many may not realise that one of the most well-known actresses in the world is in fact a nepo baby. Jennifer, 55, is the daughter of John Aniston, an actor who was best known for his role as Victor Kiriakis in the NBC drama Days of Our Lives. Jennifer, best known for her role as Rachel Green in the hit series Friends, started her acting journey aged 11 when she joined the Rudolf Steiner School's drama club. Jennifer Aniston is the daughter of John Aniston, an actor who was best known for his role as Victor Kiriakis in the NBC drama Days of Our Lives. Above: The pair pictured in New York in 1997 Nancy Dow and John Aniston are snapped with their daughter Jennifer Aniston in 1975 Jennifer Aniston, who was honoured with a star the the Hollywood Walk Of Fame, poses with her father John Aniston in 2012 She then joined the New York's School of Performing Arts and after graduating, appeared as a regular in the series Molloy in 1990 and had a recurring part on Herman's Head the following year. In 1994, she then auditioned for Friends. Her co-star Courteney Cox was originally offered the part of Rachel but she turned it down and ended up playing her roommate, Monica. During a night out in Hollywood, David Crane who is one of the co-creators of the series, stumbled across Jennifer and knew they found the perfect Rachel. But she was unavailable and signed onto another CBS sitcom Muddling Through. However it all worked out in the end, and Jennifer rose to fame after her iconic performance as Rachel and went on to star in several films such as Murder Mystery, Horrible Bosses, Bounty Hunter and Marley & Me. Hailey Bieber The 27-year-old American model and socialite is married to Justin Bieber and the pair recently announced that they are expecting a baby. Hailey is the daughter of actor Stephen Baldwin - who starred in the Usual Suspects, Fled and 8 Seconds - and graphic designer Kennya Baldwin. She included in an article listing nepo babies in 2022. But it didn't seem to phase her and she wore the title with pride, as she sported a white t-shirt with the slogan 'Nepo baby' in January 2023. In July last year, Hailey revealed why she decided to wear a 'nepo baby' crop top that caused headlines. Hailey Baldwin is pictured with her now-husband Justin Bieber and father Stephen Baldwin in New York in 2011 After she was called a nepo baby, Hailey sported a white t-shirt with the slogan 'Nepo baby' in January 2023 Hailey is the daughter of actor Stephen Baldwin - who starred in the Usual Suspects, Fled and 8 Seconds 'The nepo baby T-shirt was just meant to be my little comment on the whole discourse that had been going around,' she said in an interview with Bloomberg on Thursday. 'And, you know, my point to having worn the T-shirt was not to poke fun at it or be like, \"Yeah, I'm a nepo baby\" and ha ha type of thing.' 'It was more so to be like this is what everyone is saying, and I want you to know this is my way of responding to it and my way of acknowledging it. 'In a way that is so overly literal that it's like, \"I'm just going to call myself a nepo baby because I am one and I embrace that I am,\" she said. Hailey revealed she enjoyed wearing the controversial piece, since she had 'mixed' reactions to it. 'I'm like, \"So you're going to sit there and call me a nepo baby all day long but then I acknowledge it and then I'm not enough of a nepo baby?\" 'So, it's like, there is never any winning with the internet.' Mabel Mabel is without a doubt a successful artist and will no doubt continue to excel to great heights, but at an early stage in her career, she hasn't quite matched her mother's awards cabinet yet Mabel's mother is Neneh Cherry, a Swedish singer who has released six studio albums and has won two Brit awards Mabel Alabama-Pearl McVey's career is still in its infancy and her star will surely only continue to rise. However, as yet, she hasn't quite achieved the same number of accolades as her famous mother. Neneh Cherry is a Swedish singer who has released six studio albums; the first of which, Raw Like Sushi, reached number three in the UK Albums chart - just like her daughter's. She has been nominated for a Grammy Award and has two Brit Awards under her belt - and while her daughter Mabel is certainly catching up to her mother, the young singer hasn't quite reached Neneh's heights yet. Neneh Cherry's first album, Raw Like Sushi, reached number three in the chart - just like her daughter Mabel Her debut single Finders Keepers, released in 2017, reached number eight on the UK Singles Chart. This was followed up two years later with the release of her album High Expectations at number three in the Albums Chart - which later went platinum. In 2020, just three years after bursting onto the scene, she won a Brit Award for British Female Solo Artist. As Mabel's popularity continues to soar, she will no doubt overtake her mother - but she has a very successful act to follow. Willow Smith Willow Smith's singing career has earnt her thousands of fans among younger music lovers, but she hasn't quite reached her father's stratospheric fame Will Smith, who is known for both acting and music, has won several awards during his career, including an Oscar in 2022 for King Richard While she's had success with singles, films and appearances on Red Table Talk, Willow Smith (who goes by Willow) has yet to reach the heights of her father's fame. Perhaps a difficult task, give her father Will Smith, 55, is one of the most famous men alive and arguably the most successful rapper and actor of a generation. The 23-year-old started early. She hit number two in the UK charts with her debut Whip My Hair, when she was just ten. She's also starred alongside her dad in I Am Legend as well as a voice role alongside her mother Jada Pinkett Smith, in Merry Madagascar. Keeping it in the family, Willow also regularly joins her her mother and grandmother, Adrienne Banfield-Norris, on their hugely successful Facebook Watch show, Red Table Talk. Lola Lennox Lola Lennox released her debut single Wild in 2020 and has performed onstage with her mother on a few occasions When she was 18 years old, Lola Lennox won a place at the prestigious Royal Academy of Music. 'Classical singing is different from pop and I know more about it than my mother,' Lola told the Daily Mail in 2009 after being accepted into the school. 'I start at the academy in September and I've got there on my own. It was a tough audition and I'm really looking forward to the course.' As she stressed the point she had attained her place through her own abilities, she was perhaps referring to the fact her pop singing mother, Annie Lennox, is very successful and well connected in the music industry. First finding fame in Eurythmics in the 1980s, Annie released a string of top 10 hits throughout the decade including Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) and There Must Be an Angel (Playing With My Heart). Lola Lennox's mother Annie Lennox achieved huge success in Eurythmics and as a solo artist After taking a break from Eurythmics in the early 1990s, she also enjoyed a number one solo album, Diva. Alongside her music career, Annie has become a prominent voice in the campaign to eradicate AIDS through her work on Live Aid and Live 8. Lola has certainly enjoyed success in the music industry, but her career hasn't quite matched the stratospheric heights of her mother's. She released her debut single In the Wild in 2020 and has performed on stage with her mother a handful of times. Last year, speaking to Amazing magazine, she addressed the ' nepo baby ' row that scrutinised the careers of children in the entertainment industry who have famous parents. 'When you're looking at the music I feel really lucky to have been able to witness such a strong female role model in action and also see how much purpose it gave her,' she said, referring to her mother. Dhani Harrison George Harrison's son Dhani has dabbled in the music industry as a guitarist, following in the footsteps of his father Another member of The Beatles offspring is Dhani Harrison, son of guitarist George. Although he's a dead ringer for his rock and roll father, with long hippy hair and a goatee beard which harks back to George's 1970s look, his music career hasn't quite managed to emulate the success of the most popular British band of all time. He has struggled to make a success of his career in music, despite appearing alongside the likes of Eric Clapton and Paul McCartney at a tribute concert for George at the Albert Hall a year after his death from cancer in 2001. In 2006, he formed a band called thnewno2 in 2006. Four years later, he started another band, Fist full of Mercy. The guitarist has covered his father's songs, played on stage with Eric Clapton and Paul McCartney and joined several bands but never quite matched the success of The Beatles In 2013, he joined forces with Alexa Ray Joel, daughter of singer-songwriter Billy Joel to perform some of their father's top hits for a Gap advert. While Alexa Ray performed Just the Way You Are, Dhani gave a rendition of For You Blue. Speaking to the Daily Mail in 2012, Dhani revealed the nepo baby criticism was something he was acutely aware of. He said: 'Everyone's looking at me thinking, 'he's got it handed to him on a plate; he got that because of his dad.' However, despite having a very famous father, Dhani's career hasn't followed the same trajectory. This might be down to the fact he turned down lots of offers in his younger years, holding out for opportunities that meant something to him. He said: 'I've had every offer. But you've got to ask yourself, 'Why? What's this for'?' Kelly Osbourne Ozzy Osbourne's daughter Kelly Osbourne shot to fame in The Osbournes and is now hugely successful as a presenter, but her singing career didn't quite take off There's no one in the industry more rock and roll than Ozzy Osbourne. As the front man of Black Sabbath, he became widely known for his onstage stunts even more than for his music - having once beheaded a dove as well as biting the head off a bat during a performance. Although he was blighted by addiction for much of his music career, Ozzy managed to achieve enormous success in the industry both with Black Sabbath and as a star in his own right. In 2013 the band hit the milestone of selling 70 million records worldwide meaning they are one of the most commercially successful heavy metal bands of all time. After making a name for himself in the music industry, Ozzy later became a star of the small screen as he and his family were followed in one of the earliest reality TV shows, The Osbournes. The show followed Ozzy, Sharon, Jack and Kelly (but not oldest daughter Aimee) in expletive-laden episodes that showed their life at home. It paved the way for Kelly to become a star just like her father - but while she has achieved enormous success in the US as a presenter, Kelly Osbourne's music career hasn't quite panned out in the same way. She released her first studio album, Shut Up, in 2002 - the same year The Osbournes premiered. The album's sales were modest and reviews were mixed - however a duet with her father Ozzy, Black Sabbath cover Changes, released in 2003, drew in significantly more success and reached number one in the UK charts. Norah Jones Norah Jones, who has nine Grammys under her belt, previously said she didn't want people to think of her in association with her famous father Jazz artist Norah Jones's career has reached such heights that most people don't know she technically counts as a 'nepo baby'. As of 2023, she has sold more than 50 million records worldwide and has a whopping nine Grammy awards under her belt. She burst onto the scene in 2002 with the release of Come Away With Me, which reached diamond status and sold 27 million copies. It bagged her five Grammy awards alone including Best Album and Best New Artist. Norah's full name is Geethali Norah Jones Shankar. She is the daughter of Indian sitarist and composer, Ravi Shankar. Ravi Shankar died in 2012 after a successful music career that began in India and later saw him tour Europe and the Americas Ravi, who died in 2012, began his career in India where he was music director of All India Radio in New Delhi from 1949 until 1956. From there he started touring Europe and the Americas playing Indian classical music. Through touring, he became gradually more popular and met Beatles member George Harrison. Harrison's friendship with Shankar led to an increase of Indian instruments in Western pop music throughout the 1960s. Speaking to the Daily Mail about her father in 2012 shortly before his death, Jones said: 'I refuse to be defined by my famous dad. I hardly knew him when I was growing up and we only started a proper relationship when I was in my late teens.' However she added they now shared a 'close, very loving relationship' and added people don't tend to think of her in association with him. Miley Cyrus Miley Cyrus shot to fame on Disney series Hannah Montana and has since broken several records and won several awards Miley's father is Billy Ray Cyrus, a country singer who has also achieved firm success in his genre, but hasn't quite reached superstar status like his daughter Miley Cyrus might have had a leg-up in her career by being born into a country music family, but she has far exceeded the success of her father Billy Ray. Born Destiny Hope Cyrus, her name was chosen because her parents Billy and Tish hoped for her to succeed in life and achieve great things after she was born with an abnormal resting heart rate - and as one of the biggest pop stars in the world, she has certainly fulfilled their wishes. Miley's early success came at 13 years old when she was cast as the eponymous character in Disney's Hannah Montana, a hugely popular show about a schoolgirl living a double life as a pop star. The popularity of the show paved way for her own music career, first performing as Hannah Montana before embarking upon music released as Miley Cyrus. By the age of 16 she has become the youngest artist in history to have four albums on the Billboard 200 chart in the US. She has two Grammy Awards, one Brit Award and holds eight Guinness World Records for her success. Meanwhile her father Billy Ray, while a successful country artist, never reached the success his daughter Miley has managed to achieve. In 1992 his country album Some Gave All became the best-selling record of the year in the US, but as he became a father and his children embarked upon their own careers in the entertainment industry, his music exploits took a back seat. He starred alongside his daughter Miley as her father in Hannah Montana, which introduced him a much younger generation of fans - although, to them, he will likely always be known as 'Miley Cyrus's dad'. Mark Ronson Mark Ronson's stepfather is Mick Jones, the guitarist in rock band Foreigner who penned I Want to Know What Love Is, thought to be about Ronson's mother Ann Mark Ronson was born into a wealthy family, with his father Laurence working in real estate and his mother Ann Dexter-Jones in the TV industry. However, it's through his stepfather Mick Jones that Ronson became connected with the music industry. Jones was the guitarist in rock band Foreigner and has penned some of the group's biggest hits. Among them is I Want to Know what Love Is, which is thought to have been written about his relationship with Ronson's mother. Although he was born in north west London, Ronson spent most of his life in the US, and his DJ career began in New York City when he was a student at New York University. He has enjoyed enormous success as a DJ, producer and songwriter since becoming involved in the music industry, working on tracks like Amy Winehouse's Valerie (which became more widely known than The Zutons's original) and Bruno Mars's Uptown Funk. While his stepfather has penned one of the greatest power ballads of all time, his success falls just shy of Ronson's total 45 award wins, including an Oscar, seven Grammys - and a Guinness World Record. Enrique Iglesias Enrique Iglesias's father Julio is one of the most successful Spanish artists of all time, but his success never transferred to English-speaking audiences Enrique's career has managed to cross over from the Latin market to English-speaking audiences Enrique Iglesias's music career has seen him crowned one of the best-selling Latin artists of all time, as he spanned genres into dance music during his career. He began making music in the 1990s with Mexican label Fonovisa and quickly became one of its most successful artists. However, by 2000 he successfully crossed over into the English language music market and signed a record deal with Universal Music Group. Since moving into the world of pop and dance, he has released most singles in both English and Spanish, appealing to a wider audience - which has shown in his sales and success. He is now dubbed the King of Latin Pop and, in 2016, was named by Billboard as the 14th most successful male dance club artist of all time. Enrique's father is also a fairly successful figure in Latin music - Julio Iglesias. Julio has also achieved huge success in his career - however he didn't move into mainstream and English-speaking genres as his son did. He is recognised as the most commercially successful Spanish singer in the world and one of the top sellers in music history. While he has outsold Enrique, he hasn't quite reached out to the same broad audience. Whitney Houston Whitney Houston is one of the greatest artists ever to have lived and won eight Grammys during her career The late Whitney Houston was the daughter of Cissy Houston, a Grammy Award winner for gospel music The late, great Whitney Houston achieved great things during her career before her tragic and untimely death in 2012. Known for a once-in-a-generation voice with which she belted out anthems like Greatest Love of All and I Will Always Love You, she was one of the biggest pop stars in the world at the peak of her success. Her accolades include eight Grammy Awards, 22 American Music Awards, two Emmy Awards and an induction into several music halls of fame. In 2001, following enormous success with her first few studio albums, she renewed her record contract with Arista Records for $100 million, which to this day remains one of the biggest recording deals of all time. After becoming one of the biggest pop stars in history, the fact that Whitney Houston was technically a 'nepo baby' is somewhat forgotten. Not only was her mother Emily 'Cissy' Houston a singer, she also had two Grammy Awards to her name - although compared to her daughter's eight Grammys, it isn't quite so striking an accolade. Cissy was a member of The Drinkard Singers and the founder of The Sweet Inspirations, a vocal group that recorded background vocals for Aretha Franklin and Elvis Presley. After leaving The Sweet Inspirations, she embarked upon a solo career, for which she earnt her Grammys.

        "content": "On Monday at 1:46 p.m. a severe thunderstorm watch was issued by the National Weather Service in effect until 9 p.m. for Adams, Columbia, Cumberland, Dauphin, Lancaster, Lebanon, Lycoming, Montour, Northumberland, Perry, Snyder, Sullivan, Union and York counties. Lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times each year, with the bulk of these electrical discharges occurring during the summer months. Tragically, lightning claims the lives of about 20 individuals annually, as reported by the weather service. The risk of lightning-related incidents escalates as thunderstorms draw near, reaching its peak when the storm directly looms overhead. However, it gradually recedes as the tempest moves away. To guarantee your safety in the midst of a thunderstorm, take into account the following recommendations: 1. Lightning safety plan: When venturing outdoors, it's crucial to have a lightning safety plan in place. Monitor the sky for threatening signs and listen for the sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it's an indication that lightning is nearby. Seek a safe place to shelter, preferably indoors. 2. Indoors safety measures: Once you're indoors, avoid using corded phones, electrical devices, plumbing fixtures, and stay away from windows and doors. These precautions help reduce the risk of electrical surges, as lightning can follow conductive pathways. 3. Wait for the all-clear: After the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities. Lightning can strike even when a storm has seemingly passed, so exercise caution. When indoor shelter isn't available: If you find yourself outdoors without access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety: Avoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, as they expose you to greater lightning risk. Steer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In wooded areas, stay close to lower stands of trees. If you're in a group, ensure that individuals are spaced out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people. Camping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If no alternative exists, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. Remember that a tent offers no protection against lightning. Do not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. Although water and metal do not attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks. In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, preparedness and vigilance are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of lightning-related incidents and prioritize your safety. Heavy rainfall may lead to flooding if prolonged or if there is excessive runoff. Excessive runoff can be a result of saturated ground and/or rainfall intensity. Follow these recommendations from the weather service to stay safe in heavy rain: Beware of swollen waterways: In heavy rain, refrain from parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a grave danger. Maintain safe driving distances: Adhere to the two-second rule for maintaining a safe following distance behind the vehicle in front of you. In heavy rain, allow an additional two seconds of distance to compensate for reduced traction and braking effectiveness. Reduce speed and drive cautiously: On wet roads, reducing your speed is crucial. Ease off the gas pedal gradually and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding. Choose your lane wisely: Stick to the middle lanes to minimize the risk of hydroplaning. Outer lanes are more prone to accumulating water. Prioritize visibility Enhance your visibility in heavy rain by turning on your headlights. Watch out for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them. Watch out for slippery roads: The first half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mix of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period. Keep a safe distance from large vehicles: Don't follow large trucks or buses too closely. The spray created by their large tires reduces your vision. Take care when passing them as well; if you must pass, do so quickly and safely. Mind your windshield wipers: Overloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely impairs your vision, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or sheltered spots. If the roadside is your only option, pull off as far as possible, preferably past the end of a guard rail, and wait until the storm passes. Keep your headlights on and turn on emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position. In the face of heavy rain, these precautions can make a significant difference in ensuring your safety on the road. Remember to stay informed about weather conditions and heed guidance from local authorities for a secure journey.

        "content": "New Delhi [India], May 27 (ANI): Delhi's Tis Hazari Court on Monday dismissed the bail plea of Delhi Chief Minister's aide Bibhav Kumar in connection with the alleged assault of Aam Aadmi Party MP Swati Maliwal. The court said that the investigation is at an initial stage and that the chances of influencing witnesses and tampering with evidence cannot be ruled out. Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Sushil Anuj Tyagi said, \"The investigation is still at the nascent stage and the apprehension of influencing the witnesses or tampering with the evidence cannot be ruled out. Keeping in view the allegations made against the applicant, at this stage, no ground for bail is made out.\" \"The allegations raised by the victim have to be taken on their face value and cannot be swiped away. The mere delay in registering the FIR would not have much impact on the case as the injuries are apparent in the MLC after four days. There seems to be no pre-meditation on the part of the victim as if it would have been so, then the FIR would have been registered on the same day,\" ASJ Tyagi said in the order passed on May 27. The court while dismissing the bail plea noted that the victim is a sitting Member of Parliament from the Aam Aadmi Party and as per her allegations, she has been brutally beaten up at the CM's house by the applicant. The applicant was present at the CM's house even after his employment was terminated, the court further observed. The investigating agency has also reported that the applicant has formatted his mobile phone and has not provided the password for opening his mobile phone. The CCTV footage collected from the CM's camp office is also stated to be blank, the court noted in the order. The judge said that it has come on record that the complainant was medically examined on May 16, 2024, at AIIMS Hospital. Her statement under section 164 CrPC was recorded by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate. Her version as mentioned in the complaint finds corroboration from the MLC and her statement recorded under section 164 CrPC. The court stated that the applicant (Bibhav Kumar) was joined in the investigation, but as per the investigation officer, he did not cooperate in the investigation and was arrested to prevent him from tampering with crucial evidence. During the arguments, the counsel for the complainant argued that the victim is the sitting MP of the Aam Aadmi Party and earlier also, she has gone to meet the CM and she cannot be termed as a trespasser, rather it was the applicant/accused who was present in the CM office without any authority. It was further contended that no one reported the matter to the police from the CMoffice and it was the complainant who made the complaint to the police from the spot itself. It was also argued that the magnitude of the injuries was such that they were present even after four days when the medical examination was done. He contended that the complainant has an association with the CM since past nine years and she was brutally assaulted. She went to the police station but due to trauma, she did not lodge a complaint. It was further contended that the applicant made a complaint on May 17, 2024, at 3.34 pm through e-mail when the complainant had already reported the matter to the police. It was also contended that the complainant is receiving threats of death and rape throughvulgar messages on social media. It was contended that the applicant is not simply a PA of CM but he is a very influential person with whom the complainant is apprehending danger. It is therefore prayed that bail cannot be granted to the applicant. (ANI)",

        "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia – The International Organization for Migration on Sunday increased its estimate of the death toll from a massive landslide in Papua New Guinea to more than 670 as emergency responders and traumatised relatives gave up hope that any survivors will now be found. Serhan Aktoprak, Chief of the UN migration agency’s mission in the South Pacific island nation, said the revised death toll was based on calculations by Yambali village and Enga provincial officials that more than 150 homes had been buried by Friday’s landslide. The previous estimate had been 60 homes. “They are estimating that more than 670 people (are) under the soil at the moment,” Aktoprak told The Associated Press. Local officials had initially put the death toll on Friday at 100 or more. Only five bodies and a leg of a sixth victim had been recovered by Sunday. Around 250 additional houses have been condemned since the landslide because of still-shifting ground, leaving an estimated 1,250 people homeless, officials said. Crews have given up hope of finding survivors under earth and rubble 6 to 8 metres deep. “People are coming to terms with this so there is a serious level of grieving and mourning,” Aktoprak said. He said the new estimated death toll was “not solid” because it was based on the average size of the region’s families per household. He would not speculate on the possibility that the actual toll could be higher. Relief crews were moving survivors to safer ground on Sunday as tons of unstable earth and tribal warfare, which is rife in the Papua New Guinea Highlands, threatened the rescue effort. Convoys that have transported food, water, and other essential supplies since Saturday to the devastated village 60 kilometres from the provincial capital, Wabag, have faced risks related to tribal fighting in Tambitanis village, about halfway along the route. Papua New Guinea soldiers were providing security for the convoys. Eight locals were killed in a clash between two rival clans on Saturday in a longstanding dispute unrelated to the landslide. Around 30 homes and five retail businesses were burned down in the fighting, local officials said. Aktoprak said he did not expect tribal combatants would target the convoys but noted that opportunistic criminals might take advantage of the mayhem to do so. “This could basically end up in carjacking or robbery,” Aktoprak said. “There is not only concern for the safety and security of the personnel, but also the goods because they may use this chaos as a means to steal.” Australia, a near neighbour and Papua New Guinea’s most generous provider of foreign aid, along with the United States are among governments that have publicly stated their readiness to do more to help responders. Papua New Guinea is a diverse, developing nation with 800 languages and 10 million people who are mostly subsistence farmers.",

        "content": "It’s a challenge we encounter almost every time we sign up for a new website or service. One way to do this is via a CAPTCHA device, which is itself automated. CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart. Most Read on Euro Weekly News It is named after Alan Turing, who invented a test in 1950 that could assess a computer’s ability to mimic human behaviour. This was not so much about getting a series of questions correct but, moreover, exemplifying the same behaviour of a human being. Although sharing his name, a CAPTCHA is doing the opposite, ensuring that a user is a human, not a bot. To do this, the user is presented with jumbled-up letters and numbers that they must decipher and retype. The theory is that bots would be unlikely to be able to complete this task. Ironically, according to a recent study at the University of California, AI bots are actually more efficient at solving CAPTCHA’s than humans. What is reCAPTCHA, and how does it work? Google provides the reCAPTCHA alternative. The reCAPTCHA’s functionality is more advanced than the CAPTCHA’s and does not rely on distorted letters and numbers. Currently, three types of reCAPTCHA’s are in operation, and each behaves differently. An image recognition test asks the user to click on squares containing a specific object, such as street signs or vehicle parts. If their response matches that of the majority of other users, then the probability that they are, in fact, human is deemed to be high enough to ‘pass’. Some reCAPTCHA tests are even simpler, seemingly only requiring the user to tick a box confirming ‘I am not a robot’. However, this simple task is insufficient for Google to verify your human status. When you click, you permit Google to , determining whether you ‘pass’. This can include mouse movements, browsing history and even time to complete an online form. Finally, and most recently, CAPTCHA Enterprise requires no user interaction. Instead, Google takes a holistic view of a user’s website behaviour and applies a score. In effect, the lower the score, the more likelihood of a bot. So, next time you check that box to say ‘ I am not a robot,’ remember that it is not as magical as it might first appear. Over to you In today’s era of data transparency, should websites that use reCAPTCHAs be more open about how they work? Thank you for taking the time to read this article.

The Toronto-based model, who hosts Naked News ’ fitness segment “Flex Appeal,” will join other nude riders in the annual international event as they bare all for the environment. This year’s protest calls for the reduction of the use of oil, and the unclothed event is designed to put a spotlight on alternative transportation options. “I’m excited to be participating in Toronto’s World Naked Bike Ride to highlight the over-usage of oil and urban pollution while endorsing cycling safety on our streets,” Adams said in a statement. “There’s something incredibly liberating about cruising through the city on a bike, feeling the wind against my skin, and making great memories as we pedal through the heart of this incredible city.” Adams, an adult content creator who also co-hosts the show’s sex and relationship segment, The Bare Naked Truth , has been tied to the series for 15 years, making her the longest Naked News presenter since the series launched in 1999. https://www.instagram.com/p/Cz84rrUuEmF/ “Being a part of the Naked News team for 15 of its 25 years has been an incredible experience. When I started back in 2009, I never imagined that this role would become such a defining part of my life,” she recently told the Daily Star . “Here’s to 15 amazing years, and hopefully many more to come,” she added. The dress code for the World Naked Bike Ride is, as always, “as bare as you dare,” but protesting riders are welcome to wear clothing. It kicks off on June 8 at 1 p.m. at Toronto’s Coronation Park.",

        "content": "Jammu, May 27 (PTI) Heatwave has triggered a severe water and power crisis in several areas of the Jammu division, prompting authorities to set up control rooms and appoint nodal officers in each district to cater to public complaints. On Monday, authorities announced a four-hour load-shedding in urban areas and an eight-hour cut in rural areas on a daily basis. Over the past week, several places, particularly Jammu city, have faced major water and power shortages, leading to public protests, and the stopping of a Vande Bharat train at a railway station. In view of the mounting distress, Divisional Commissioner Ramesh Kumar has directed deputy commissioners to establish control rooms and appoint nodal officers in each district to handle complaints related to power and water supply. Kumar, who chaired a meeting to deal with the issue, emphasised the need to maintain a buffer stock of transformers and water tankers in each district to meet the public demand. He urged officials to augment water and power supplies to minimise public inconvenience during the summer. An official said it was decided that the chief engineers must ensure their teams are ready for timely repair of pipelines and replace public health engineering motors and damaged transformers. \"Engineers must be responsible and accountable for delivering services,\" the person said. Jammu has been reeling under an extreme heat for the past fortnight. Jammu city on Monday recorded its hottest day of the season at 42.8 degrees Celsius, 3.7 degrees above normal for this time of year, according to the meteorological department.",

The former President's hand barely left his head during Sunday's NASCAR Cup Series Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina. Trump Force One sent the crowds wild by flying over the track, then Trump got a warm reception as he waved to the fans in the stands. Trump snaps back at booing crowd as he's branded 'worst president in history' Republican governor faces backlash after pushing to get Biden on state ballot Wearing his famosu red MAGA cap, Trump walked down the pit lane as NASCAR fans shouted \"make America great again\" and \"you're our man, Trump.\" However, he was slammed for actually showing a lack of respect by saluting during the National Anthem and a rendition of Saving Grace. Taking to X, one person wrote: \"Serious question. Why is he saluting? He is not the President anymore--so not the Commander in Chief, and he was never in the military. He looks silly saluting.\" \"It should be hand over heart and that is one of the worst salutes I have seen,\" added another. A third said: \"He is saluting whom during the National Anthem? Most hold their hand over their heart.\" Technically, civilians should avoid saluting as a service member would and should place their hand or hat over their heart.

Trump was also seen saluting to a military fly-over that happened before the race. He managed to make his way round a lot of the race course, taking in views from the suite, a special box at pit road and on the rooftop. At one stage he was seen waring noise-canceling headphones as the cars zoomed past. The former President also got the chance to meet 'king of NASCAR' Richard Petty, who has supported Trump since 2016 and gave him a hug. Trump was also the guest of car owner Richard Childress atop the pit box for the No. 3 Chevrolet driven by Austin Dillon. Sadly, the race was shortened due to the rain and was won by Christopher Bell.",

        "content": "The Simpsons , one of the most iconic TV shows in history, has had its fair share of shocking storylines. One such storyline was so controversial that creator Matt Groening has disowned the episode entirely. Simpsons script writer calls out Jeopardy host over huge error on show The Simpsons kill off major character as Lisa unleashes into a murderous rampage The episode in question, The Principal and the Pauper, is widely regarded as one of the show's worst. It was so poorly received that Groening has vowed never to discuss it again. The plot revolves around Seymour Skinner, the principal of Springfield Elementary , preparing to celebrate his 20th anniversary at the school. A surprise party is planned by the school staff, and everything seems to be going smoothly until a mysterious man arrives claiming to be the real Seymour Skinner. In a shocking twist, it turns out he is telling the truth. The backstory reveals that the two men met in the Army, and the person everyone knew as Seymour Skinner was actually Armin Tamzarian.

Armin went to deliver the tragic news to Seymour's mother, who mistook him for her real son. When the truth comes out, Armin leaves Springfield and the real Seymour takes over as principal. However, the townsfolk shun the real Seymour, preferring the imposter. By the end of the episode, Judge Snyder declares that Armin will once again become Seymour Skinner, and the real Seymour is banished from the town. The Simpsons episode, The Principal and the Pauper, has long been a subject of criticism for its outlandish plotline. It seems fans aren't alone in their disdain. In a 2002 interview with Rolling Stone, Matt Groening confessed that the episode was a \"mistake\". He stated: \"We make some missteps, but we acknowledge it on the show. We had an episode where it was revealed that Principal Skinner was an impostor. By the time we finished the episode, we realized it was a mistake, and we had a judge say, 'We'll never speak of this matter again.' And we never did.\" The Principal and the Pauper is often seen as a pivotal moment in The Simpsons' history, frequently labeled as one of the worst episodes ever by fans. References to the episode have appeared in other Simpsons episodes, serving as a reminder of the show's increasingly eccentric storylines.",

        "content": "Basketball Hall of Fame legend Bill Walton laughs during a practice session for the NBA All-Star basketball game in Cleveland, Feb. 19, 2022. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File) Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ‘Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.”",

        "content": "FORT NELSON, B.C. — Residents in Fort Nelson are returning home after being evacuated from the community for more than two weeks due to wildfires. The Northern Rockies Regional Municipality and the Fort Nelson First Nation jointly rescinded their evacuation orders at 8 a.m. Monday, lifting roadblocks and clearing the way for people to go home. A statement from the municipality says the community has been deemed safe to re-enter but there are still active fires in the area. An evacuation alert, requiring people to be ready to leave at short notice, is now in place. \"(The) alert will remain in effect until such time as the risk has been eliminated,\" the statement says. About 4,700 residents were forced to leave their homes in Fort Nelson on May 10, when strong winds pushed the Parker Lake wildfire within a few kilometres of the town. The fire destroyed four homes and damaged six other properties in the area. The municipality said several properties are not safe for the general public. An order is in place limiting access to those properties to only property owners, their designates or other permitted personnel. The municipality said residents arriving home would have access to free cleaning kits provided by the Red Cross. A statement from Northern Health said emergency services at Fort Nelson General Hospital are resuming. \"The hospital’s emergency department is reopening Monday morning with limited laboratory and medical imaging supports. Other departments will resume services in the weeks ahead,\" the statement said. The health authority said people requiring in-patient care will continue to be transferred to other facilities in the northeast. Wildfire crews are also fighting the Patry Creek fire about 25 kilometres north of town, which is a holdover fire that was initially ignited by lightning in July 2023. The regional municipality's mayor, Rob Fraser, has asked residents to be patient as they navigate what's expected to be heavy traffic on the highway between Fort Nelson and Fort St. John, 380 kilometres to the south, where many of the evacuees have been staying. The latest data provided by BC Wildfire Service lists 113 active wildfires in the province, 102 of which are in the northeast. In a video update posted online Sunday, Hugh Murdoch, an incident commander working out of Fort Nelson, said there is a \"tremendous amount of fire\" in the region, with about 2,500 square kilometres burning in the Northern Peace complex. Murdoch said 130 firefighters are working on the Parker Lake and Patry Creek fires, along with 11 pieces of heavy equipment and 19 helicopters. \"The summer is going to be a long one, I think. It's had an early start again and there seems to be just so much fire on the landscape so early,\" he said. \"And it's not just lightning that's going to give us our starts, but these holdover fires from the previous year (are) another source that's giving us a lot of challenges.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.

        "description": "FORT NELSON, B.C. — Residents in Fort Nelson are returning home after being evacuated from the community for more than two weeks due to wildfires.",
        "content": "FORT NELSON, B.C. — Residents in Fort Nelson are returning home after being evacuated from the community for more than two weeks due to wildfires. The Northern Rockies Regional Municipality and the Fort Nelson First Nation jointly rescinded their evacuation orders at 8 a.m. Monday, lifting roadblocks and clearing the way for people to go home. A statement from the municipality says the community has been deemed safe to re-enter but there are still active fires in the area. An evacuation alert, requiring people to be ready to leave at short notice, is now in place. \"(The) alert will remain in effect until such time as the risk has been eliminated,\" the statement says. About 4,700 residents were forced to leave their homes in Fort Nelson on May 10, when strong winds pushed the Parker Lake wildfire within a few kilometres of the town. The fire destroyed four homes and damaged six other properties in the area. The municipality said several properties are not safe for the general public. An order is in place limiting access to those properties to only property owners, their designates or other permitted personnel. The municipality said residents arriving home would have access to free cleaning kits provided by the Red Cross. A statement from Northern Health said emergency services at Fort Nelson General Hospital are resuming. \"The hospital’s emergency department is reopening Monday morning with limited laboratory and medical imaging supports. Other departments will resume services in the weeks ahead,\" the statement said. The health authority said people requiring in-patient care will continue to be transferred to other facilities in the northeast. Wildfire crews are also fighting the Patry Creek fire about 25 kilometres north of town, which is a holdover fire that was initially ignited by lightning in July 2023. The regional municipality's mayor, Rob Fraser, has asked residents to be patient as they navigate what's expected to be heavy traffic on the highway between Fort Nelson and Fort St. John, 380 kilometres to the south, where many of the evacuees have been staying. The latest data provided by BC Wildfire Service lists 113 active wildfires in the province, 102 of which are in the northeast. In a video update posted online Sunday, Hugh Murdoch, an incident commander working out of Fort Nelson, said there is a \"tremendous amount of fire\" in the region, with about 2,500 square kilometres burning in the Northern Peace complex. Murdoch said 130 firefighters are working on the Parker Lake and Patry Creek fires, along with 11 pieces of heavy equipment and 19 helicopters. \"The summer is going to be a long one, I think.

        "content": "Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu has revealed she didn’t turn up to the Celebrity Big Brother finale because her management felt she was in a ‘vulnerable’ place. The British-Turkish Love Island star, 29, made very few friends during her stint in the house, with some fans worried her behaviour had turned the public against her after a number of outbursts. But now the TV personality has insisted that her behaviour in the house, which saw her leave the show to a chorus of boos and then blame ITV editors for making her look bad, was down to relationship problems off-camera. Admitting that going into the house in the first place was a bad move she wishes she could take back, Ekin-Su has now revealed she was told her ex-boyfriend Davide Sanclimenti had cheated on her. ‘I should never have gone into the Big Brother house. I was angry, hurt, maybe a bit bitter, definitely insecure – Big Brother is not where you go to heal heartache, let me tell you.’ She told The Sun : ‘I went into the show thinking that I could rebuild myself after everything that happened with Davide, but I came off worse. My guard was up.’ After saying she blamed herself for making a poor decision to enter the reality series in the first place, she did defend her actions on the show by insisting she wasn’t feeling her true self. ‘I blame myself for making a poor choice in my career. People could see that I wasn’t myself, and I can understand why they thought I was being fake. ‘I never wanted to believe the allegations against Davide but people would tell me I was being cheated on all the time. I was so scared of being alone, and I didn’t know who the hell Ekin-Su was meant to be without him.’ Ekin-Su and Davide announced that they had split 11 months after their Love Island victory , with Davide saying he was ‘grateful for the memories and opportunities’ they shared together. In the aftermath of their break-up, she claimed to have seen images on Davide’s phone that caused her to believe he was cheating on her while the pair were filming a documentary together. Shortly after, Ekin-Su entered the Big Brother house, and quickly went from Love Island hero to Celebrity Big Brother villain following a run of outbursts. After mingling almost exclusively with former X Factor judges Louis Walsh and Sharon Osbourne – a move which some deemed cynical – she was hostile towards other housemates.

        "content": "When it comes to a George Miller directed Mad Max saga movie, actors are committed 1000% to the stunts, but composers are there too for the long haul. So much so, that Furiosa composer Tom Holkenborg aka Junkie XL moved to Sydney, Australia to pen the score, his third with Miller after Mad Max: Fury Road and Three Thousand Years of Longing. In fact, there’s a fine line between the metallic bang of motorcycles and trucks, and bass, and one of the arbitrator of that is Holkenborg who had a hand in sound mixing Furiosa. You can listen to our conversation with Holkenborg out of Deadline’s Cannes Studio below: Related Stories News 'Furiosa' Inches Out 'Garfield' With $32M But No. 1 Race Still Close In Dullest Memorial Day Weekend - Monday AM Update News 'Simon Of The Mountain' Review: Federico Luis' Critics' Week Winner Is A Wholly Original Debut - Cannes Film Festival Holkenborg points out that when it came to the music in Furiosa, it’s character-driven given how it centers around the protagonist’s life from 8 to 18 years of age, versus Fury Road, which took place in a desert race of 48 hours. “Musically, everything was being told from a first-person perspective, which is being her, how she, watches the world around her, The Wasteland, its cruelties,” the composer elaborates. A key set piece in Furiosa are the 197 shots devoted to a big rig heist, a bulk of which doesn’t have music. The chords commence when we first learn of Furiosa’s role in the action sequence. “Where there is absolutely silence, (it’s) one of the most powerful tools that you can have as a composer,” says Holkenborg, “The earlier composers and the earlier directors understood this really well.” “George and I talked so much about certain classics like Bullitt with Steve McQueen or The French Connection with Gene Hackman, where there are chases in there where no score is being done for the majority of the scene, and then when it really, really counts, when something becomes really emotional or something gets really, really tense, that is when music is brought in to give that extra layer to an action sequence.” “Restraint was the way forward,” explains Holkenborg. Furiosa opened this weekend to $65.3M at the global box office. The movie received a near eight-minute standing ovation at its Cannes Film Festival premiere. The movie has high grades from Rotten Tomatoes critics at 90% certified fresh and audiences who gave it the same marks. Deadline’s Cannes Studio Is Sponsored by NEOM.",

        "description": "Toronto FC fullback/wingback Richie Laryea, sidelined by a hamstring injury since the Feb. 25 season opener, is expected to return to action Saturday at D.C. United.",
        "content": "Toronto FC fullback/wingback Richie Laryea, sidelined by a hamstring injury since the Feb. 25 season opener, is expected to return to action Saturday at D.C. United. Coach John Herdman said Laryea will travel with the MLS team for Wednesday’s game in Philadelphia but won’t take the field until Saturday. With two away games this week, Toronto plans to stay south of the border after the mid-week game. Laryea, one of Toronto’s designated players along with Italian stars Lorenzo Insigne and Federico Bernardeschi, underwent surgery March 23 in London, England. At the time, his recovery time was said to be three months. Herdman said Laryea won’t be on the active roster for the Philadelphia game. “The expectation is Richie will play minutes against D.C. United,” Herdman said after training Monday. “That’s been the plan, so this week he’s ramping up. He’ll hit all his sort of final check boxes and put a real intense training week in but will travel with the team so he’s ready to go against D.C.” The 29-year-old Laryea and TFC captain Jonathan Osorio were included Monday in Jesse Marsch’s first roster selection as Canada coach for friendlies June 6 and 9 against the Netherlands and France. “I’m proud for those lads,” said Herdman, who stepped down in August as Canada coach to take over Toronto. “I know what it means to them to represent their country. “Richie’s had a tough run so I’m pleased Jesse put the trust in him, because he’s a guy who loves playing for Canada. He gives his everything and I’ve seen him reach special levels in that Canadian jersey. While he plays in MLS, when he plays for Canada he’s able to show he’s got world-class ability. And I’d say the same for Osorio.” While Toronto does not have any games scheduled while Laryea and Osorio are away for the friendlies, Herdman will feel the pain during Copa America, which runs June 20 to July 24. ”(Copa America) comes at time for us in June where you’d love to have had that full squad available,” he said. “But having been the guy that took players away from MLS clubs and not worry too much about it, being on the other end you’ve just got to pat these boys on the back and wish them all the best.” Laryea, who has 48 caps, last played for Canada in November’s CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinal series against Jamaica. Osorio has 71 caps. Rookie wingback Tyrese Spicer, who came off in the 58th minute of Saturday’s 4-3 loss to visiting FC Cincinnati, is questionable for Wednesday’s game with a gastrointestinal issue. “We’re just learning whether it’s muscular or something different,” Herdman said. Forward Prince Owusu is being monitored for a tight calf. Midfielder Brandon Servania (knee) and defender Shane O’Neil (thigh) remain on the injured list. Bernardeschi returns this week after missing the Cincinnati game due to yellow card accumulation. Toronto (7-7-1) goes into mid-week play in sixth place in the Eastern Conference, two places and four points ahead of Philadelphia (4-4-6). TFC has won just one of its last four league matches (1-0-3). But it has won seven of its last 10 (7-3-0) in all competitions. —- Follow @NeilMDavidson on X platform, formerly known as Twitter This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024",

        "description": "\"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement.",
        "content": "Bill Walton, the dominant college big man who won a pair of NBA championships and later enjoyed a successful broadcasting career, has died, the NBA announced on Monday. He was 71. Walton died after a prolonged battle with cancer, the league said. He was surrounded by his family. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. \"As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams.\" Walton was the No. 1 overall pick in the 1974 draft by the Portland Trail Blazers, and he led the team to their only NBA title in 1977. Named the league MVP in 1978, the 6-foot-11 Walton won another title as a member of the Boston Celtics in 1986, when he earned the Sixth Man of the Year award. But that season proved to be his last hurrah. Walton, who battled injuries throughout his career, would play just 22 more games between the regular season and playoffs before retiring in 1988. Before his pro career, Walton was a two-time champion at UCLA, leading the Bruins to titles in 1972 and 1973 and an 88-game winning streak. His 44 points in the national championship game in 1973 remain a record. Walton was also a three-time national player of the year at UCLA while playing for legendary coach John Wooden. \"On behalf of everyone with the UCLA men's basketball program, we are deeply saddened to learn of Bill Walton's passing,\" UCLA head coach Mick Cronin said in a statement , adding: \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality.\" After his playing career, Walton overcame a stutter to become a successful sportscaster known for his colorful commentary, which often included catchphrases and hyperbole. \"In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can't talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,\" Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. \"Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It's become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else's biggest nightmare.\" A self-professed \"Deadhead,\" Walston sometimes appeared on TV wearing Grateful Dead T-shirts. He was also known to wear tie-dyed T-shirts while delivering his unique commentary, which could be equal parts entertaining and bewildering. \"What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,\" Silver said. \"He was a regular presence at league events - always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" Walton was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993.

Promotions and products are subject to availability and retailer terms. As we get ready for shorts and bathing suit season , saying goodbye to unwanted hair is a top priority for many (including me). I first dabbled in laser hair removal pre-pandemic when I got professional IPL laser treatment on my face at a med spa. At the time, I was nervous about the procedure and didn’t want to take any chances with my face. But after hundreds of dollars and a few years, I needed a touch-up. As I was leaving my last appointment a couple of weeks ago, having spent $60 for about 30 seconds of treatment, I started to research at-home laser options. I knew I wasn’t looking for any budget-friendly tools—laser hair removal is not where I want to skimp when it comes to devices! I also messaged The Curator’s Beauty Editor Adriana Monachino to see if she had any insight into devices. She was quick to send me a link to the Ulike . Story continues below advertisement It’s all the rage on TikTok , she quickly texted back, and reviewers claim it’s safe, it works and it’s pain-free. I slept on it and then decided to go all in. It takes about four weeks to see the full effects, but as the warm weather is quickly approaching, I wanted to share my results week by week. The Ulike is also on sale right now (don’t forget to add the coupon code!), so if you’ve been on the fence, now is a great time to give it a try. Ulike Laser Hair Removal The Air 3 is an IPL laser hair removal device that you can use at home. You’ll start to see a noticeable reduction of hair in about three weeks. There’s a ‘soft mode’ for your face and bikini area, a ‘body mode’ for legs and arms and a ‘power mode’ for chest and armpits. The kit comes with the device, a charger, protector glasses and a bag to store everything in. $359 on Amazon (was $459) How it works Intense Pulse Light Therapy (IPL) is where the light from the device passes through the skin’s surface and is absorbed by the melanin of the hair follicle. This process essentially kills the hair follicle, so it doesn’t grow back. Story continues below advertisement Now, in order for the light to be able to target the hair follicle, there needs to be contrast between the colour of your hair and your skin tone. The more contrast, the better IPL works. Ulike has this chart which will help you figure out if it’s the right hair removal method for you. (Ulike) Week 1 More Recommendations 20 Father’s Day gifts to show dad you care This Dyson Cool Fan is $100 off right now (hurry!) My target areas: Armpits, bikini and legs. Curator tip : Always do a skin test before you do a full treatment. I did a small area on my leg to see how my skin reacted. I had no issues, so the next day, I started. Step 1 : Make sure you shave the area before treatment. The kit comes with a handy travel razor which I used. Step 2: Plug in the device and hold down the power button. For the first week, I started with ‘soft mode’ just to see how I would react to the treatment. Step 3 : Place the device on your skin and press the flashing button to activate the light pulse. Slowly move the device along the treatment area, pressing the button. For larger areas like my legs, you can hold the button down so the light continuously flashes as you glide the device over your skin. How often? For the first four weeks, I will treat three times a week. Results so far : This device is cool to the touch, so even though intense heat is penetrating your skin, the device feels cool on your skin. After I treat my armpit, I can feel a bit of a stinging sensation for a few minutes—but it’s nothing that would deter me. No marks of any kind were left on my skin, so even though I don’t need a touch-up on my face right now, I wouldn’t hesitate to use it in the future. Use lots of sunscreen after! Slathering on your favorite SPF will be key this entire time. Story continues below advertisement Ulike Air 10 Ulike Air 10 Laser Hair Removal Want to kick things up a notch? Ulike has just released the Air 10. It has the latest technology and promises results in just two weeks. This device has dual lights which means it’s more powerful. Now, it also comes with a bigger price tag, but if you have a lot of unwanted hair and it tends to be dark and coarse, then this device is a great option for you. $559 on Amazon More from The Curator Miracle Balm: Is it worth the hype?",

        "description": "Mexico is on course to elect its first woman president this weekend, with two front-runners competing to break the highest political glass ceiling in a country with a history of gender violence and inequality.The post Mexico expected to elect first woman president appeared first on Khmer Times.",
        "content": "MEXICO CITY – Mexico is on course to elect its first woman president this weekend, with two front-runners competing to break the highest political glass ceiling in a country with a history of gender violence and inequality. Ruling-party candidate Claudia Sheinbaum and opposition hopeful Xochitl Galvez, both 61, have dominated the presidential race in the world’s most populous Spanish-speaking country, home to 129 million people. The only man running, Jorge Alvarez Maynez, is trailing far behind with just days left before the vote. “It’s a huge change,” said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University, in the United States. “A woman president will be an inspiration for women in every single sector of the economy, politics, society, and culture,” she told AFP. Sheinbaum owes much of her popularity to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a close ally who has an approval rating of more than 60% but is only allowed to serve one term. A former Mexico City mayor and a scientist by training, Sheinbaum has 55% of voter support, according to a poll average compiled by research firm Oraculus. Galvez, an outspoken senator and businesswoman with Indigenous roots who represents a broad coalition of opposition parties, has 33%. Maynez, 38, of the small Citizens’ Movement party, has just 12%. Mexico’s next president will face an array of challenges, including managing migration, delicate relations with the neighbouring US, and criminal violence that has left more than 450,000 people dead and tens of thousands missing since 2006. Around 30 candidates for local office have been murdered in a wave of electoral violence since last September, in a country where politics, corruption, and crime are closely intertwined. Whoever wins, it will likely be business as usual for the cartels that control swaths of the country and smuggle vast amounts of cocaine, fentanyl, and other drugs into the US, experts predict. “They’re not going to change their attitude just because Mexico has a female president,” Correa-Cabrera said. Another major challenge will be Mexico’s complex relationship with the US, particularly if former president Donald Trump is reelected in November, Shifter said. “If he returns to the White House, Trump is expected to double down on his hardline stance on immigration, trade, and drugs – very sensitive issues crucial to the bilateral relationship,” he said. As well as voting for a new president, Mexicans will choose members of Congress, several state governors, and myriad local officials. In total, more than 20,000 positions are being contested, with nearly 100 million people registered to vote.",

He gave a threat. Initially, he abused Punjabis a lot. He issued a threat that after June 4, the Punjab government will be toppled. Bhagwant Mann will no longer remain the chief minister after June 4.\" \"We have 92 seats (MLAs). How can you topple (government)? There is a dictatorship (in the country),\" Kejriwal said and alleged that the BJP leaders were openly saying that they would threaten the legislators with the CBI and the ED and then \"buy\" them.\"I want to tell him... do not threaten the people of Punjab.

Or will you impose president's rule?\" The AAP national convener alleged that the BJP wants to end the free electricity facility in Punjab and said, \"I want to tell the people that give 13 seats to the AAP if you want continuation of free electricity.\" Reacting to Kejriwal's allegation, Shekhawat claimed Shah did not say that the AAP government would be toppled. He further said that people in Punjab are \"feeling cheated\" and \"completely dissatisfied\" with the AAP government and are praying to be freed from its \"misrule.\" Kejriwal also hit out at the Narendra Modi government, claiming it has done no work in the last 10 years to show to the people. He took out roadshows in Jalandhar and Ludhiana in support of party candidates Pawan Kumar Tinu and Ashok Prashar, respectively.In Abohar, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann too slammed Shah over his remarks and said, \"Do you have the courage to topple the government? We have 92 seats. They are threatening us. Are you coming (here) to seek votes or threaten to topple the government?\" Later during the press conference in in Bathinda, Mann asked, \"What do you think of us? Do you think we are for sale? I want to tell the home minister that we have high regard for you as you are the Union home minister. But telling a CM of any state that he will be removed.. such threat will not work. Punjabis are angry over this.\" Mann accused the BJP of playing politics of hatred and polarization and said that the AAP was seeking votes in Punjab based on the work done by his government in the last two years.\"After 10 years, the prime minister is unable to talk about building schools and giving jobs. He just speaks about 'mangalsutra', meat and 'Pakistan.

For those how have cut the traditional cable cord and are opting for streaming services, you can still view the new series on Philo (free trial) or Sling TV (free trial). About the Show According to the show’s official synopsis, “Through exclusive sit-down interviews with those involved including former fraternity and sorority members, family, law enforcement and experts, the series details how these organizations that seemingly offer acceptance and community for young people have far-reaching consequences that can turn dangerous, and even deadly. Over the course of six episodes, the series details a variety of first-hand accounts of the dark side of fraternity and sorority life at universities across the country. From a pledge at the University of Missouri hazed into drinking excessive quantities of alcohol that left him close to death, and a junior at the University of Minnesota who fought back against the Greek system after she was brutally raped by a fraternity brother, to a shocking set of overdose deaths at San Diego State University, and the infamous Machine, steeped in racist traditions of the Old South, at the University of Alabama, the series offers a far-reaching examination of how the seemingly fun and frivolous world of Greek life could hide a much darker underbelly.” Where to find A&E channel You can find which channel A&E is on by using the channel finders here: Verizon Fios, AT&T U-verse, Comcast Xfinity , Spectrum/Charter , Optimum/Altice , DIRECTV and Dish .

        "content": "Aston Villa manager Unai Emery has signed a new five-year contract with the club after taking them into next season’s Champions League. The 52-year-old Spaniard has turned Villa around since arriving from Villarreal in October 2022 with the club sitting 17th in the Premier League. Emery led them to seventh place in his first season in charge and fourth in this campaign. “I am very happy to take this step and the responsibility of leading this club,” said Emery, whose existing deal still had another three years to run. “There’s a great chemistry in Aston Villa. And the element of the fans’ support also makes the difference to feel like home. “We are really excited to continue this journey with no limits to our dreams,” he said. Emery also took Villa, the 1982 European Cup champions, to the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League this season in their first European campaign for 13 years. The club’s Chairman Nassef Sawiris said, “We are building something special here at Aston Villa with Unai at its core, and we are delighted that he has signed a new deal with the club until 2029. “As we move into our historic, 150th anniversary year, there is a lot to look forward to with Unai at the helm.” Aston Villa undoubtedly want to bolster their squad this summer after the superb achievement of reaching the Champions League – but the news that manager Unai Emery has agreed a new five-year contract means they have already captured the most vital signature of all. Emery extended his current deal until 2027 in April but this was always with the intention of a longer-term extension once the season finished. Villa have wasted no time in tying up their inspirational manager for the future. The Spaniard has overseen a stunning rejuvenation of Villa since succeeding the sacked Steven Gerrard in October 2022. Emery’s new contract is a sign of ambition from Villa’s owners but also an indication of the faith he has in them, in partnership with his long-time associate, Villa’s president of football operations Monchi. The fact that Emery has taken them into the Champions League was beyond fans’ most optimistic expectations this season. Emery has put Villa ahead of schedule but there will be no complaints as they mix with the Champions League big names for the first time. They will feel confident of making an impact under a manager with such pedigree in the European environment, one who already has four second-tier Europa League titles to his name. He has already assumed hero status at Villa Park and it will be a source of joy to everyone at the club that Emery has now signed up until 2029.",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.”",

        "content": "Andy Murray bid farewell to the French Open following a crushing defeat by Stan Wawrinka , and his career could now be coming to an end. The 2016 finalist suffered his third consecutive loss to the Swiss star at Roland Garros, marking his second first-round exit in a Grand Slam this year. At 37, the Scot was defeated in Paris with a score of 6-4 6-4 6-2 in just two hours and 19 minutes under the harsh lights of Court Philippe-Chatrier. Reflecting on his past performances at the French Open, he said: \"I did really well here over the years. I always showed up and put in some strong performances, considering. It was a good run here over the years.\" Before the match, the 2016 finalist had stated that he had not yet decided on his retirement this summer, saying: \"When the time is right, I will stop. I don't know if I will play past the summer.\" His retirement seemed one step closer last night. Despite playing with a new Yonex racquet, the outcome remained unchanged. He hasn't advanced past the third round in 14 Grand Slams since his title defense at Wimbledon in 2017 ended in the quarter-finals. Murray will still participate in the doubles with Dan Evans in preparation for the Olympics later in the summer. After a final Wimbledon, it could be his last appearance. Follow us on X for the best and latest in sports news World No. 1 Novak Djokovic candid about his struggles and modest hopes for French Open Tennis power couple Paula Badosa and Stefanos Tsitsipas reunite ahead of French Open Wawrinka, dressed in bright yellow shorts and trainers, dazzled the main court with his brilliant winners, and the one-sided victory was never really in doubt. He swiftly dismantled Murray, breaking him four times and surging to a 4-0 lead in just 15 minutes during the third set. The Swiss maestro clinched victory on his first match point with a 35th winner signature backhand down the line. Post-match, the two legends shared an embrace and exchanged words at the net before Murray paused to acknowledge the crowd with applause as he exited the court, reminiscent of his departure in Melbourne this past January, hinting at a possible farewell. Wawrinka expressed his feelings post-match: \"It was an emotional, for sure. My first words were respect for a great champion.\" Murray reflected on the match: \"Obviously disappointed. It was always going to be a tough, tough match. Stan has played brilliant tennis on that court.\" Murray continued, \"I was expecting him to play very well tonight. I think he did that. He gave me very few opportunities. I wish I could have done a little bit better.\" Despite the loss, Murray remained pragmatic: \"Disappointed but, I didn't have extremely high expectations with the way, you know, the preparation had been coming in. But obviously would have liked to have done better tonight.\" Earlier, Jack Draper's defeat to world No. 176 Jesper De Jong dashed hopes of a high-profile showdown with Carlos Alcaraz. The British No. 2 mounted a comeback from two sets and 0-3 behind to push the match to a fifth set against the Dutch qualifier. However, a visibly frustrated Draper let slip expletives and his serve at 3-4 after a disastrous ninth double fault on break point. The world No. 39 faced a crushing blow, suffering his worst Tour-level defeat by ranking in the longest match of his career. After an intense four hours and six minutes, he was defeated 7-5, 6-4, 6-7 (3), 3-6, 6-3. Visibly disappointed, he expressed his feelings post-match: \"Obviously very frustrated,\" and added, \"This loss hurts a lot. I know I'm so much better than how I played today, and that's what hurts.\"",

        "content": "Furiosa is currently the talk of the box office- for better or for worse- but fans hoping for an alternate cut akin to Fury Road’s Black and Chrome release have reason to get excited. franchise creator George Miller sat down for a chat with Josh Horowitz on the Happy Sad Confused podcast to discuss the release of , as well as the past and future of the franchise. During the chat, Miller surprised Horowitz by confirming that an alternate cut of Furiosa was already completed. “We’ve done it already,” Miller revealed. “It’s the last thing I did on this film. I call it tinted black and chrome.” The potential for a black-and-white cut of Furiosa is undoubtedly exciting news for fans of the saga. Mad Max: Fury Road received a critically acclaimed black-and-white cut called Mad Max: Fury Road—The Black and Chrome Edition. Black & Chrome was arguably received better than the original, with many saying the film’s bombastic visuals work even better in stark black-and-white. This makes the second black-and-white cut of a film Miller has done, though the Australian filmmaker isn’t quite sure himself why he’s so fascinated with the desaturated art style. “I’m still trying to demystify why the black and white, for me, has something more elemental to it.” Miller tells Horowitz. “I still can’t quite put my finger on it. It’s not because they look like old black-and-white movies. If we took a picture of ourselves right now, it might be a little more dramatic if it was black and white.” Miller doesn’t offer an update on when or if Furiosa’s alternate cut will be released, but it may not be long. Fury Road’s Black & Chrome cut was released in 2016, a year after the original theatrical run. Given the success of Fury Road’s re-release, Furiosa’s may get a quicker release. Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is currently in theaters, but it’s not all positive news. The film has had a shockingly soft opening weekend, charting the in three decades.

        "description": "The Parliamentary Assembly of NATO has passed a new declaration urging the alliance's members to lift some restrictions on Ukraine's use of their weapons on Russian soil as the Kiev regime continues to lose ground on the battlefield.",
        "content": "NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told The Economist on May 24 that Western countries should lift their respective bans on Ukraine using their weapons inside Russia. The newspaper alleged that Stoltenberg's target was US President Joe Biden's policy of limiting Ukraine's use of ATACMS long-range missiles and other weapons inside Russia except for Crimea and the nation's new territories admitted in September 2022. On May 27, the NATO Parliamentary Assembly (PA) - the consultative interparliamentary entity – passed Declaration 489 which urges the bloc's members to \"lift some restrictions\" on the use of their weapons by the Kiev regime against Russia's \"legitimate targets.\" NATO PA representatives from nine countries have reportedly not supported the initiative. Earlier, Italy and Germany spoke against the proposal that could lead to the outbreak of a major war between Russia and NATO. The Biden administration has not granted Ukraine a free hand in using its arms against Russia, either. \"The United States has made it clear that it too does not support the lifting of restrictions using American weapons,\" Scott Ritter, a military analyst and former US Marine Corps intelligence officer, told Sputnik. \"There is some debate , discussion and dialog inside the United States to reverse this policy. But, at the present moment, the United States continues to impose restrictions.\" { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:294:2216:1180_640x0_80_0_0_b398c48a0a435b16a4f550c347198885.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:113:2216:1360_640x0_80_0_0_3ef894f30d6e57ac4f6a7c525ebfdef5.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:113:2216:1360_640x0_80_0_0_3ef894f30d6e57ac4f6a7c525ebfdef5.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_127:0:2091:1473_640x0_80_0_0_2710efda21760b7f4caa76483fcd50de.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_127:0:2091:1473_640x0_80_0_0_2710efda21760b7f4caa76483fcd50de.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_372:0:1845:1473_640x0_80_0_0_a2fc6a27eee1ade4a02139a84123943c.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_372:0:1845:1473_640x0_80_0_0_a2fc6a27eee1ade4a02139a84123943c.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 640, \"height\": 256 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:294:2216:1180_1280x0_80_0_0_c53abbb04288631f15f5da134df089d8.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:113:2216:1360_1280x0_80_0_0_ef9e8ebd60ade9dbbe1ac89870581467.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:113:2216:1360_1280x0_80_0_0_ef9e8ebd60ade9dbbe1ac89870581467.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_127:0:2091:1473_1280x0_80_0_0_f0cb4d94957c89137f9c8ea3ab2111ca.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_127:0:2091:1473_1280x0_80_0_0_f0cb4d94957c89137f9c8ea3ab2111ca.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_372:0:1845:1473_1280x0_80_0_0_be5a5ae01fe3bb85102a56a9cfbdb484.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_372:0:1845:1473_1280x0_80_0_0_be5a5ae01fe3bb85102a56a9cfbdb484.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1280, \"height\": 512 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:294:2216:1180_1920x0_80_0_0_ebc84af52c9c897f207aa761ed0c2837.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:113:2216:1360_1920x0_80_0_0_174bb3300113f3eef9df11c29b94a0f7.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:113:2216:1360_1920x0_80_0_0_174bb3300113f3eef9df11c29b94a0f7.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_127:0:2091:1473_1920x0_80_0_0_e688d94c42112b500ac5df58bed314c9.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_127:0:2091:1473_1920x0_80_0_0_e688d94c42112b500ac5df58bed314c9.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_372:0:1845:1473_1920x0_80_0_0_e6c811be7885c26349c3fde542c90f01.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_372:0:1845:1473_1920x0_80_0_0_e6c811be7885c26349c3fde542c90f01.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1920, \"height\": 768 } World Ukraine Might Not Become NATO Member Within Next 30 Years - Scholz 01:55 GMT However, it's up to NATO member states to decide whether to authorize the use of their weapons by Ukraine against Russia, despite Stoltenberg's calls or NATO PA's non-binding declarations. Ritter pointed out that \"NATO as an institution is not preparing for a larger war with Russia.\" He referred to the fact that so far NATO has conducted a policy to avoid escalation of the Ukraine conflict and prevent a full-fledged confrontation with Russia. The crux of the matter is that NATO member states are unprepared for a war with Russia, according to Michael Maloof, former senior security policy analyst in the US Office of the Secretary of Defense. \"All the [NATO] countries would have to switch their economies over from a service economy to a full production wartime economy. And they're not capable of it. They can't sustain it. It would take years for them to do that,\" Maloof told Sputnik. { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/101664/22/1016642244_0:967:1500:1567_640x0_80_0_0_3233df7a60cc14bd66231c4c10b73140.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/101664/22/1016642244_0:845:1500:1689_640x0_80_0_0_a462ae5095265a038482bd1b49cb338d.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/101664/22/1016642244_0:845:1500:1689_640x0_80_0_0_a462ae5095265a038482bd1b49cb338d.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/101664/22/1016642244_0:705:1500:1830_640x0_80_0_0_8d269406e3884ac50217d00337f5c038.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/101664/22/1016642244_0:705:1500:1830_640x0_80_0_0_8d269406e3884ac50217d00337f5c038.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/101664/22/1016642244_0:429:1500:1929_640x0_80_0_0_1f0762a99b25655a487cb2d5370ca98b.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/101664/22/1016642244_0:429:1500:1929_640x0_80_0_0_1f0762a99b25655a487cb2d5370ca98b.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 640, \"height\": 256 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/101664/22/1016642244_0:967:1500:1567_1280x0_80_0_0_6bd5ecc0e28632de6c1de7424e38e810.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/101664/22/1016642244_0:845:1500:1689_1280x0_80_0_0_5f65aeca5d45ac678dec7d301a4e9522.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/101664/22/1016642244_0:845:1500:1689_1280x0_80_0_0_5f65aeca5d45ac678dec7d301a4e9522.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/101664/22/1016642244_0:705:1500:1830_1280x0_80_0_0_681e7507d76588680998e2e966a9baa2.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/101664/22/1016642244_0:705:1500:1830_1280x0_80_0_0_681e7507d76588680998e2e966a9baa2.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/101664/22/1016642244_0:429:1500:1929_1280x0_80_0_0_6670a33a11edc21ecba4f49d7ce7e013.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/101664/22/1016642244_0:429:1500:1929_1280x0_80_0_0_6670a33a11edc21ecba4f49d7ce7e013.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1280, \"height\": 512 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/101664/22/1016642244_0:967:1500:1567_1920x0_80_0_0_d3ac4a0ef63aba215140f879938c48e4.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/101664/22/1016642244_0:845:1500:1689_1920x0_80_0_0_853e37694c5435a9bcedb48f1265e25e.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/101664/22/1016642244_0:845:1500:1689_1920x0_80_0_0_853e37694c5435a9bcedb48f1265e25e.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/101664/22/1016642244_0:705:1500:1830_1920x0_80_0_0_4d032631a041333d1c05b7382b43a005.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/101664/22/1016642244_0:705:1500:1830_1920x0_80_0_0_4d032631a041333d1c05b7382b43a005.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/101664/22/1016642244_0:429:1500:1929_1920x0_80_0_0_b3bb920d0b3012ca8796dbdffc33f5ac.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/101664/22/1016642244_0:429:1500:1929_1920x0_80_0_0_b3bb920d0b3012ca8796dbdffc33f5ac.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1920, \"height\": 768 } World Prelude to WWIII: Italy Slams NATO Chief's Proposal to Allow Ukraine to Strike Deep Into Russia Yesterday, 09:00 GMT \"I think you're going to see European countries [leaders] like [Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor] Orban and others that are probably going to begin to chime in here to say, you know, we've had enough of this. I think Italy is already beginning to make noises in the same direction as well as Germany, in addition to Orban,\" the former Pentagon analyst continued. The pundits believe that support for the use of NATO-grade weapons by Ukraine stems from the transatlantic alliance's desperation over the Kiev regime's continuous military failures. In early May, French President Emmanuel Macron told The Economist that Paris could put boots on the ground in Ukraine if frontlines are broken and Kiev officially requests such assistance. Almost at the same time, UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron told Reuters that Britain had given the Kiev regime permission to strike targets on Russian territory with weapons it provided. { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:290:2253:1191_640x0_80_0_0_98668d6ec119bd21e56c5e19f647e264.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:107:2253:1374_640x0_80_0_0_c6bd0e0e9babc006efd21667dbaf3854.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:107:2253:1374_640x0_80_0_0_c6bd0e0e9babc006efd21667dbaf3854.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_117:0:2253:1602_640x0_80_0_0_062a2def597bb0824bfe7084950eac7e.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_117:0:2253:1602_640x0_80_0_0_062a2def597bb0824bfe7084950eac7e.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_648:0:2250:1602_640x0_80_0_0_a4f15f02ce1f09ed46a0ab50c68263f5.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_648:0:2250:1602_640x0_80_0_0_a4f15f02ce1f09ed46a0ab50c68263f5.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 640, \"height\": 256 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:290:2253:1191_1280x0_80_0_0_18a80bca2ddb7f05822f56aec2dfd4c5.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:107:2253:1374_1280x0_80_0_0_ba8f82d4fd7cbebaca1dd6c53d934039.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:107:2253:1374_1280x0_80_0_0_ba8f82d4fd7cbebaca1dd6c53d934039.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_117:0:2253:1602_1280x0_80_0_0_00a88d6260afa964757247fda474388d.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_117:0:2253:1602_1280x0_80_0_0_00a88d6260afa964757247fda474388d.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_648:0:2250:1602_1280x0_80_0_0_cbed335c0e1061c35366e15404467261.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_648:0:2250:1602_1280x0_80_0_0_cbed335c0e1061c35366e15404467261.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1280, \"height\": 512 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:290:2253:1191_1920x0_80_0_0_dce7ed155436721459223360ff7853e0.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:107:2253:1374_1920x0_80_0_0_f1cf1969a36f4f3837f24984481d05fe.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:107:2253:1374_1920x0_80_0_0_f1cf1969a36f4f3837f24984481d05fe.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_117:0:2253:1602_1920x0_80_0_0_66a31c45b5ebc6acd1e753157248b9ac.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_117:0:2253:1602_1920x0_80_0_0_66a31c45b5ebc6acd1e753157248b9ac.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_648:0:2250:1602_1920x0_80_0_0_b52e2962100406d291cdde4fd6d2a683.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_648:0:2250:1602_1920x0_80_0_0_b52e2962100406d291cdde4fd6d2a683.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1920, \"height\": 768 } World Macron and Cameron's Threats to Flood Ukraine With 'Men and Arms': Signs of Weakness? 3 May, 19:10 GMT Moscow has repeatedly warned the collective West against deeper involvement in Ukraine's conflict. Russia condemned Macron's statements as provocative and fraught with a risk of further escalation. Commenting on Cameron's words, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova noted that the British foreign minister de facto confirmed that the West is waging a war against Russia using Ukrainians as proxies. Reflecting on Stoltenberg's remarks last week for The Economist, Zakharova drew attention to the fact that the NATO chief's warmongering rhetoric came ahead of the so-called \"peace\" conference on Ukraine in Switzerland that is advocating the unworkable Zelensky \"formula\" while ignoring Russia's position. \"Objectively, the reality is that NATO is in no position to escalate the war and sustain it,\" Larry Johnson, retired CIA intelligence officer and State Department official, told Sputnik, reiterating his forecast about the Kiev regime's imminent defeat. \"Yes, they could put troops in. They could provide some temporary assistance to Ukraine. But really, there is nothing that's going to change the outcome or the trajectory of the war,\" the CIA veteran concluded. { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:410:3072:1639_640x0_80_0_0_267c53f372d6881fb3292c6c817ae546.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:160:3072:1888_640x0_80_0_0_bd9cd68750a61ede19a32f97bc23f9f0.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:160:3072:1888_640x0_80_0_0_bd9cd68750a61ede19a32f97bc23f9f0.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_171:0:2902:2048_640x0_80_0_0_3da2ab1472eb4408631199356d9daac3.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_171:0:2902:2048_640x0_80_0_0_3da2ab1472eb4408631199356d9daac3.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_512:0:2560:2048_640x0_80_0_0_6039a67919a79e0c572548ad86087756.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_512:0:2560:2048_640x0_80_0_0_6039a67919a79e0c572548ad86087756.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 640, \"height\": 256 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:410:3072:1639_1280x0_80_0_0_b2c2d2cf5f896546a0c56058bacfba6e.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:160:3072:1888_1280x0_80_0_0_aac87ab74d43c48d5352316537f032d1.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:160:3072:1888_1280x0_80_0_0_aac87ab74d43c48d5352316537f032d1.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_171:0:2902:2048_1280x0_80_0_0_b6a0c095dc1b437355ca7ffd5a5a0f4f.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_171:0:2902:2048_1280x0_80_0_0_b6a0c095dc1b437355ca7ffd5a5a0f4f.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_512:0:2560:2048_1280x0_80_0_0_27952844c909092804ab9fd741bf023f.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_512:0:2560:2048_1280x0_80_0_0_27952844c909092804ab9fd741bf023f.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1280, \"height\": 512 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:410:3072:1639_1920x0_80_0_0_1caf154c7e20fa3f315bf160dd33a884.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:160:3072:1888_1920x0_80_0_0_7fb22c5d865fad753acdff0727461f22.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:160:3072:1888_1920x0_80_0_0_7fb22c5d865fad753acdff0727461f22.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_171:0:2902:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_c8939d59bd296baaa625f32e9cd5ee4b.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_171:0:2902:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_c8939d59bd296baaa625f32e9cd5ee4b.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_512:0:2560:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_532370fc9e1570ee92c6f83643423e96.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_512:0:2560:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_532370fc9e1570ee92c6f83643423e96.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1920, \"height\": 768 } Analysis Stoltenberg’s Call to Untie Ukraine's Hands to Strike Russia Shows NATO is Desperate 25 May, 17:26 GMT",

        "content": "The Detroit Tigers had an extra day to savor their biggest offensive output of the season. After getting Memorial Day off, they'll open a two-game home series against the Pittsburgh Pirates on Tuesday. Detroit extended its winning streak to three games on Sunday afternoon with a wild 14-11 win over Toronto. The Tigers blew 5-0 and 8-3 leads, then rallied to score the game's last five runs. Matt Vierling capped it off with a two-out, three-run homer in the ninth off Blue Jays closer Jordan Romano. \"There was a lot in that game to love and a few things not to love so much,\" manager A.J. Hinch said. \"But what an ending.\" Vierling, who had four hits, also homered earlier in the game. He was waiting on a slider and got it on a 3-2 count for his first career walkoff homer. \"My brother and I in the backyard, we'd always be doing situations like that,\" he said. \"It's kind of cool when it actually happens.\" The Tigers can reach the .500 level again with a win on Tuesday. The three-game win streak was preceded by a five-game slide. They'll have their best arm on the mound. Tarik Skubal (6-1, 2.25 ERA) will carry a little extra motivation into the contest after taking his first loss of the season in his last start. Skubal gave up four runs in five innings to Kansas City on Wednesday, requiring 96 pitches to get 15 outs. \"It was partly command and they had some really good at-bats,\" said Skubal, who had not given up more than two earned runs in his previous seven starts. \"They fouled off some really good pitches and there were too many pitcher's counts that went to 3-2 counts. And that's a credit, I guess, to their hitters. I've got to do a better job at finishing those at-bats.\" Skubal is 1-0 with a 3.46 ERA in three career appearances against Pittsburgh. The Pirates took two of three games during a weekend series against Atlanta but lost Sunday's finale, 8-1. Starting pitcher Martin Perez and catcher Joey Bart both departed the game early with injuries. Pittsburgh has listed its dynamic young duo of Jared Jones and Paul Skenes as its starting pitchers in the Detroit series. Jones (3-4, 3.05 ERA), a 22-year-old rookie, has gone at least six innings in all four of his May starts. In his last outing, he gave up three runs and six hits in six innings against San Francisco. He allowed a two-run homer to Matt Chapman in the sixth and the Pirates wound up losing in extra innings. \"I threw the pitches I needed to throw when I needed to throw them,\" Jones said. \"Obviously, I need to get better at throwing certain pitches in tight spots where that could end up costing us the ballgame. I think that's what happened. I don't give up that home run to Chapman if I throw a better pitch, (and) we probably walk away with a win.\" Jones will be facing the Tigers for the first time.

        "content": "In a year in which we have already been treated to the \" \" in April and one of the in the past 500 years in May, what other amazing celestial attractions might 2024 have in store for us? How about a bright naked-eye comet? Over the last couple of years, two comets have made headlines in the mainstream media. In early February 2023, Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF), informally called the \" \", passed near Earth and then during the past month, drew attention because of its propensity for experiencing sudden flare-up in brightness and appearing to spout gaseous appendages resembling horns, thus giving rise to the moniker \"Devil's Comet.\" The only problem so far as the person-on-the-street was concerned was that both comets were difficult to see unless you were located under a dark, non-light polluted sky. And even through or a , both were rather unimpressive, appearing as nothing more than faint, fuzzy blobs of light. The only problem so far as the person-on-the-street was concerned was that both comets were difficult to see unless you were located under a dark, non-light polluted sky. And even through good binoculars or a small telescope, both were rather unimpressive, appearing as nothing more than faint, fuzzy blobs of light. But by the end of this summer, we may have a good idea as to whether we'll have a bright and easy-to-see naked-eye comet gracing our early autumn evening sky. The comet in question is C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan–ATLAS), discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in South Africa on Feb. 22, 2023. ATLAS is a robotic early warning system developed specifically for detecting near-Earth asteroids a few weeks to just days before they might impact . Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Originally thought to be an , it was later determined that this same object was photographed six weeks earlier by the Purple Mountain Observatory (Tsuchinshan) in the east of Nanjing, . It has since been determined to actually be an incoming comet. When the comet was first sighted, it was far out beyond the orbit of Jupiter, some 680 million miles (1.09 billion km) from the sun. But on Sept. 27 of this year, Tsuchinshan–ATLAS will be making its closest approach to the sun, coming to within 36 million miles (58 million km). That also happens to be the average distance of the planet that is closest to the sun, . And just over two weeks later, on Oct. 12, the comet will pass just 44 million miles (71 million km) from Earth. These figures suggest that the comet might brighten to second or possibly even first magnitude and could develop a notable tail that could make for an eye-catching sight in the western evening sky during mid-October 2024. Unfortunately, there is a caveat: calculations show that Tsuchinshan–ATLAS has an orbital eccentricity of 1.0001081, meaning that it is a \"first-timer,\" coming directly from the , a spherical shell of icy space debris scientists theorize to be situated far beyond the and thought to contain billions or even trillions of comets. Comets originating from the Oort cloud have never passed near to before and their nuclei are coated with very volatile materials that vaporize far from the sun, creating short-lived surges in brightness. But as these comets get nearer to the sun, their brightening slows or even stops completely. Most — though admittedly not all — comets originating from the Oort cloud usually end up being duds. Typically, as these comets cross the orbit of , their steady brightening trend starts to falter, similar to a marathon runner at the 20-mile mark; \"hitting the wall\" so to speak. In the case of a comet having emerged from the Oort cloud, a sudden decline in brightening may be signaling that it ultimately will end up underperforming. Comet Tsuchinshan–ATLAS will not get to that point in its orbit until late July. If it then continues to steadily brighten beyond that time, then there's a good chance it will evolve into an eye-catching sight. But, more likely, if its brightening trend suddenly slows, or even comes to halt, all bets for a good show are off. Until then, all we can do is wait and watch. Unfortunately, we here in the Northern Hemisphere will not be able to check on the status of Comet Tsuchinshan–ATLAS during this summer because it will be situated much too far south to be accessible with telescopes. Those living in far-southerly locations, such as Australia, New Zealand and South America, however, will be able to track it in the morning sky before sunrise. We'll need to rely on reports from these parts of the globe to tell us whether the comet is on track to possibly becoming a bright object. Another thing that could work in our favor is that the geometry of the comet relative to the sun and Earth, places it almost in-between the sun and Earth around Oct. 8, creating a phenomenon known as \"forward scattering of sunlight.\" If the comet is particularly dusty, dust particles ejected from the comet nucleus would preferentially scatter sunlight in a forward direction and could cause a dramatic upsurge in the comet's brightness. To this end, there are two comets that Tsuchinshan–ATLAS might be compared to, which suddenly brightened-up thanks to forward scattering. The first was Comet Skjellerup–Maristany (C/1927 X1), which briefly became very bright in December 1927. Forward scattering of light on Dec. 18, 1927 allowed the comet to be seen during daylight by virtue of blocking the light of the sun with one's hand; it has since been ranked as among The other comet was , also known as the Great Comet of 2007 and given the designation C/2006 P1, and was the brightest comet in over 40 years; easily visible to the naked eye for observers in the Southern Hemisphere in January and February 2007. At its brightest on Jan. 12, 2007, this comet appeared at least twice as bright as Venus and, like Skjellerup–Maristany, was visible worldwide in broad daylight next to the sun. This extreme brightness was also attributable to forward-scattering. Some calculations suggest that Tsuchinshan–ATLAS might become as brilliant as Venus around Oct. 8, 2024 — although in the sky — like the comets of 1927 and 2007 — it will also be very near to the position of the sun. In the days that follow, however, Tsuchinshan–ATLAS should sweep rapidly northward and become well-placed for viewing in the western sky by mid-October. Although it will now be fading as it recedes from both the sun and Earth, it hopefully will be bright enough to be well-seen with the naked-eye, perhaps accompanied by a notable tail as well. But there are no guarantees. In the past, there have been comets that seemingly promised a great show that failed to live up to expectations. of 1973-74 is a good example. Conversely, there have been comets that did not look like they would perform well, that ended up unexpectedly becoming celestial showpieces. surprised everyone during the summer of 2020 by putting on a good show. — — — The legendary comet expert Dr. Fred Whipple perhaps said it best when he said: \"If you must bet, bet on a horse, not a comet!\" In the meantime, fingers crossed for Comet Tsuchinshan–ATLAS!

        "content": "wigglestick/iStock via Getty Images We previously covered Celestica Inc. ( NYSE: CLS ) in March 2024, discussing how it had been a beneficiary of the ongoing generative AI boom, with the increased demand for ML/ AI-related products likely to trigger its accelerated top/ bottom line growth through FY2026. Despite the inherently lower-margin manufacturing business model, we believed that there remained great long-term growth opportunities, attributed to the ramp-up in Thailand/ Malaysia operations, with us initiating a Buy rating then. Since then, CLS has further rallied by +27.5% well outperforming the wider market at +1.6%. Even so, we are maintaining our Buy rating here, thanks to the promising demand commentaries from Nvidia's ( NVDA ) and Super Micro Computer's ( SMCI ) recent earnings calls. This is further aided by the CLS management's promising FQ2'24 guidance, growing return on invested capital, and finally, the guidance of growth acceleration on a YoY basis in the coming quarters. CLS' Investment Thesis Remains Robust, Thanks To NVDA's Impressive Earning Results For now, CLS has reported a double beat FQ1'24 earnings call, with overall revenues of $2.2B ( +7.8% QoQ / +20.2% YoY), overall operating margins of 6.2% (+0.2 points QoQ/ +1 YoY/ +3.5 from FY2019 levels of 2.7% ), and adj EPS of $0.86 (+22.8% QoQ/ +82.9% YoY). Much of the tailwinds are attributed to the robust performance observed in the Connectivity & Cloud Solutions segment, with accelerating revenues of $1.44B (+8.2% QoQ/ +38.4% YoY) and expanding operating margins of 7% (+0.3 points QoQ/ +1.2 YoY/ +3.4 from FY2019 levels of 2.6%). This is not a surprising development indeed, thanks to the \" continued demand strength for AI/ML compute and networking products from hyperscaler customers.\" This is especially since NVDA recently reported an impressive Q1'24 revenues of $26.04B (+17.8% QoQ/ +262.1% YoY) while guiding Q2'24 revenues of $28B (+7.5% QoQ/ +107.4% YoY), smashing consensus estimates of $22.03B and $26.8B, respectively. The same has been reported by SMCI, a company offering complete server solutions, with Q1'24 revenues of $3.85B (+5.1% QoQ/ +200% YoY) while guiding Q2'24 revenues of $5.3B (+37.6% QoQ/ +143.1% YoY). These developments continue to suggest the robust demand for generative AI infrastructures, thanks to their inherent leadership in data center chips and complete server solution markets. At the same time, NVDA already guides new AI chips every year instead of the previous cadence of every two years, implying accelerated replacement rhythm, naturally triggering further tailwinds for Electronics Manufacturing Services [EMS] and Original Design Manufacturer [ODM] companies, such as CLS. This is especially since CLS is involved across the broader technology market, with the generative AI boom already triggering notable expansion in the sales of cloud-related electronic components. As a result, it is a given that CLS has raised its FY2024 guidance to revenues of $9.1B (+14.3% YoY), operating margins of 6.1% (+0.5 points YoY), adj EPS of $3.30 (+35.8% YoY), and adj Free Cash Flow of $250M (+28.9% YoY). This is up drastically from the previous numbers of $8.5B (+6.7% YoY), 5.75% (+0.15 points YoY), $2.70 (+11.1% YoY), and $200M (+3.1% YoY) offered in the FQ4'23 earnings call, further implying its ability to capitalize on the generative AI infrastructure boom. The Consensus Forward Estimates Tikr Terminal As a result, it is unsurprising that the consensus forward estimates have been raised again, with CLS expected to generate an accelerated top/ bottom line growth at a CAGR of +11.6%/ +22.2% through FY2025. This is compared to the previous estimates of +9%/ +15.4%, respectively. Most importantly, despite the higher capex related to the manufacturing ramp up in its expanded facilities in Thailand and Malaysia through 2025, the management continues to report robust Free Cash Flow generation of $65.2M (-22.1% QoQ/ +608.6% YoY) and expanding margins of 2.9% (-1 points QoQ/ +2.4 YoY/ -2.2 from FY2019 levels of 5.1%) in the latest quarter. This suggests CLS' ability to sustainably fund its growing operations while maintaining a healthy balance sheet with net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.72x in FQ1'24, compared to 0.76x in FQ4'23, 1.12x in FQ1'23, and 0.68x in FQ4'19. CLS Valuations Seeking Alpha As a result, we can understand why the market has awarded CLS with the premium FWD P/E valuations of 17.65x, higher than the previous article at 16.08x and its 1Y mean of 10.86x. It is undeniable that CLS may be relatively expensive compared to its EMS and ODM competitors, including Flex Ltd. ( FLEX ) at FWD P/E valuations of 13.87x, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd. ( OTCPK:HNHPF ) [2317:TW] at 10.65x, and Quanta Computer ( OTC:QUCCF ) at 21.80x. Then again, the premium appears to be justified for now, due to CLS' accelerated profitable growth prospects over the next few years compared to FLEX at +2.7%/ +14.2% and HNHPF at +10.5%/ +15.1%, while nearing QUCCF at +34.6%/ +24.1%, respectively. So, Is CLS Stock A Buy , Sell, or Hold? CLS 5Y Stock Price Trading View For now, CLS has charted a new peak beyond the early 2024 heights, with it also running away from its 50/ 100/ 200 day moving averages. Despite so, based on the annualized FQ1'24 adj EPS of $3.44 (+22.8% QoQ/ +82.9% YoY) and the raised FWD P/E valuations of 17.65x, the stock appears to be trading near to our fair value estimates of $60.70. There remains an excellent upside potential of +21.2% to our long-term price target of $71.30 as well, as discussed in our previous article. As a result, we are maintaining our Buy rating for the CLS stock, though with no specific recommended entry point since it depends on the individual investor's dollar cost average and risk appetite. With the stock currently buoyed by the highly promising NVDA and SMCI guidance thus far, we believe that interested investors may want to wait for a moderate retracement to its previous trading ranges of between $41s and $49s for an improved margin of safety.

        "content": "The first step to realising your dream of studying in Canada is getting a Canada Student Visa, officially known as a study permit. This permit is essential—it’s your ticket to study at any of Canada’s designated learning institutions (DLIs). In this guide, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know, from eligibility requirements and application steps to what to do once you arrive. Whether you’re curious about working while studying or aiming for permanent residency, we’ve got you covered. Simply put, a Canada Student Visa allows international students to attend schools, colleges, and universities in Canada. The main purpose? To give you legal permission to stay and study. Without it, you can’t enrol in any designated learning institution (DLI). If you’re wondering about the difference between a student visa and a study permit, it’s not a big deal. So, you need both to make your study plans in Canada a reality. I know you’re curious, but studying in Canada is fantastic. Beyond the stunning environment and friendly people, there are some seriously compelling reasons to pack your bags and make the country your next stop. Canada is home to some of the world’s best universities and colleges. Think University of Toronto, McGill University, and the University of British Columbia, just to name a few. These institutions consistently rank high globally for their academic excellence and research opportunities. When you study in Canada, you get a top-notch education that is recognised worldwide. One of the coolest things about studying in Canada is its vibrant multicultural environment. You’ll meet people from all over the globe, making friends and connections that will last a lifetime. Whether in busy Toronto or calm Halifax, you’ll find a mix of cultures, languages, and cuisines. It’s like travelling the world without leaving campus! Studying in Canada doesn’t just mean being glued to the books. Thanks to the Canada Student Visa, you can work part-time during your studies (up to 20 hours a week) and full-time during breaks. This is a great way to gain valuable work experience, earn extra cash, and get deep into Canadian culture. Aside from this, you can apply for a Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) after you graduate. This allows you to work in Canada for up to three years. It is a fantastic opportunity to kickstart your career and secure a permanent job. Many international students fall in love with Canada and decide to stay. Thankfully, Canada makes this transition smoother than you might expect. There are several pathways to permanent residency for students: In short, Canada values the contributions of international students and actively encourages them to stay and build their futures in the country. Before you seize this opportunity, let’s make sure you tick all the boxes for eligibility. Here’s a rundown of what you need to qualify for a Canada Student Visa. ALSO READ: Canada removes requirement for language testing in non-express entry applications First, you need an acceptance letter from a designated learning institution (DLI). DLIs are schools approved by a provincial or territorial government to host international students. You can only start the visa application process with this acceptance letter. So, apply to your chosen schools, get accepted, and keep that letter handy. Next, you must prove you can afford to live and study in Canada. This means showing you have enough money to cover: Typically, you need to demonstrate you have at least CAD 20,635 for each year of your stay (in addition to tuition). This amount might be higher if you’re studying in a more expensive city or bringing family members. Canada takes safety seriously, so you must provide a police clearance certificate to show you don’t have a criminal record. This step ensures you won’t pose a risk to Canadian society. If you’ve had any issues with the law, be upfront about it and provide the necessary documentation. You might need to undergo a medical exam depending on where you’re coming from and how long you plan to stay. This assures the authority that you’re in good health and won’t pose a health risk to Canadians. The exam needs to be done by a panel of physicians approved by the Canadian government. The medical exam cost will vary depending on the clinic you visit. It typically ranges from CAD 150 to CAD 300. You can find a list of Panel Physicians authorised to conduct Immigration Medical Examinations on the website of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) Lastly, you must convince the visa officer that you’ll return home after your studies. This means showing strong ties to your home country, like a job offer, family, or property. The aim is to prove that you won’t overstay your visa and that you’re genuinely planning to return after graduation. If you’ve decided to study in Canada, we’ve got you covered. We’ll explain the application process step-by-step to help you move from dreaming to doing. The application process for a Canada Student Visa might seem difficult, but breaking it down into manageable steps can make it a whole lot easier. Here’s what you need to do: Here’s a checklist of the documents you’ll need: Biometrics—your fingerprints and a photo—are an essential part of the application process for most applicants. Here’s how it works: Getting a Canada Student Visa requires careful attention to detail, but with the right preparation, you’ll be well on your way to starting an exciting new chapter in Canada. We know this is everyone’s favourite topic. Maybe yours, too. Because, let’s face it, nobody likes waiting around or breaking the bank. Here’s what you need to know to plan your Canada Student Visa journey. How long does it take to get your visa sorted? Well, it varies. The processing time for a Canada Student Visa can range from a few weeks to a few months, depending on where you’re applying and the time of year. Generally, applying well in advance is a good idea to avoid any last-minute stress. The application fees for a Canada Student Visa can change, so it’s essential to check the latest updates on the IRCC website. As of now, here’s a rough estimate: Remember that these fees are subject to change, so always double-check before submitting your application. Okay, so we’ve covered the basics, but what about these little additional costs that can catch you off guard? Here is one to keep in mind: It’s essential to budget for both the application fees and these potential extra expenses to ensure you’re financially prepared for your Canada Student Visa journey. Staying updated on the latest changes to the Canada Student Visa program is crucial for prospective students. Here are the key updates for 2024: Starting January 22nd, 2024, most students will need a Provincial Attestation Letter (PAL) from the province or territory where they plan to study. This new requirement means that your study permit application will likely be returned without a PAL. For more details, check the official IRCC page on PAL . The Canadian government has introduced a two-year cap on the number of study permits issued in response to the high volume of student visa applications. For 2024, approximately 35% fewer permits will be issued compared to 2023. This temporary cap might impact application processing times, so it’s important to apply as early as possible. The minimum proof of funds requirement has been increased. To study in most provinces, you must now show access to at least $20,635 per year, excluding tuition fees. This is a significant increase from the previous requirement of $10,000. Ensure you have the necessary financial documentation to meet this new threshold. These updates aim to manage the influx of student visa applications and ensure that international students are well-prepared to study in Canada. Stay informed and plan accordingly to navigate these changes smoothly. By now, you must have been in Canada. Yes, this is the time to put yourself together and get settled in for a new chapter. Here’s a helpful guide on what to do once you touch down in Canada. First, you’ll need to go through immigration clearance when arriving at the entry port. Have your Port of Entry (POE) Letter of Introduction, acceptance letter, proof of funds, and other necessary documents ready. The immigration officer will ask a few questions, stamp your passport, and welcome you to the country. Now that you’re officially in Canada, setting up a local bank account is essential. Having a Canadian bank account makes it easier to manage your finances, pay bills, and receive wages if you plan on working part-time. Research different banks and their student account options to find one that suits your needs. Finding a place to call home is next on the agenda. Whether you’re looking for a dorm room, an apartment, or a homestay, plenty of options are available to international students.

Suppose your study permit expires before you receive a decision on your extension application. In that case, you may be eligible for implied status, which allows you to remain in Canada under the same conditions as your previous permit until a decision is made on your extension application.

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email As an emerging cycling brand, RANDRIDE always puts quality as the focus of its products. It insists on focusing on affordable prices and excellent performance, and produces various styles and models of ebikes. RANDRIDE ebike uses extremely durable material – Aluminum Alloy, it has won the favor of many riders through its sturdy and sturdy frame. What we tried riding was the RANDRIDE Forerunner electric mountain bike. This electric mtb adopts a stylish full suspension frame design, mainly equipped with a 1000W brushless motor, a 48V 23AH removable lithium battery, Shimano 27-speed gear shift system and Shimano front and rear hydraulic brakes. RANDRIDE Forerunner emtb ’ s Specs Weight: 64 lbs(29 kg) Rider height range: 5’2′′ ~ 6’8′′ (158 – 203 cm) Total Payload Capacity: 410 lbs (186 kg) Battery: 48V 23Ah lithium battery(removable) Motor: 1000W Brushless motor Motor sensor: Torque Sensor Torque: ≥90 NM Number of Pedal Assist Levels: 5 Display: Colorful LCD display(with USB charging port); Display the information of speed, mileage, power, gear etc. Wheel Size: 27.5′′X2.4′′ CST Puncture-resistant Tire Gear Shift System:Shimano 27-speed Brake Type: Shimano Hydraulic Brakes Shipping and Assembly First of all, the packaging of RANDRIDE is very strong. The Forerunner electric mtb arrived without any damage, and the gifts are also included. During the assembly process, I was able to assemble the product easily, and all the accessories were assembled. I have assembled many bicycles, so this off road ebike was not a problem for me. I assembled it in about 30 minutes. Of course, there are corresponding instructions in the box for assembly, and there are also assembly videos on the website for reference. How the RANDRIDE Forerunner Ebike Performed Since we need to conduct professional tests to test the performance of Forerunner, we chose some different terrains for field testing. Performance: Urban Overview I set the pedal assist to first gear, and I can drive on city roads smoothly, and the driving is very smooth and the speed is very gentle. Different settings can be made according to different riding conditions, but for me personally, using one It’s perfectly adequate for riding in high gear. The Forerunner is specially designed for off road riding, but its performance on flat terrain is not inferior, and it is even more suitable for city riding than some bikes specifically designed for city ebikes. Performance: Off-Road Overview On rugged roads, I drove the Forerunner for many challenges. It can adapt well to various terrain changes, including winding roads, uphill roads, and downhill curves. We have tested them in some places. There are gravel, some places are smooth and covered with moss, but these cannot hinder the progress of this e bike mtb. It conquers these terrains well and completes the challenge. Performance: Pedal Assist Modes and the Motor RANDRIDE’s motor has been set to the highest wattage before leaving the factory, so it travels very fast. Top speed reaches over 30 mph(48 kph0. What I like about this emtb is that its maximum speed can be set freely to suit the speed limit policies of different roads. The torque of the Forerunner is 90 NM. Most of the time I will not use 90 NM. I will only use the highest torque when climbing hills to conquer the terrain. The motor does not make any noise when driving. The entire driving process is very quiet and no excessive noise can be heard. Performance: Hill Climb Test When I use the Forerunner to climb hills, the entire process is very easy. The pedal assist is very effective and gives a lot of support during the entire climbing process. Assistance makes the entire climbing process relatively easy. The ebike is very light, so its own weight will basically not affect the speed of climbing. Performance: Brake Test Forerunner off road ebike uses Shimano Hydraulic Brakes, which do not make any sound during the braking process, and the operation is not very complicated. It can be triggered by gently pinching with your fingers. Throughout our testing, we found the brakes to hold up well and provide good feedback. On my way home, the brakes felt secure and sure-footed, working quickly even on steep terrain. Used with the 27.5′′X2.4′′ CST Puncture-resistant Tire, there is no need to worry about braking problems on various gravel roads. Performance: Range and Battery Test The Forerunner’s details page claims that in pure electric mode, its battery life is 57+ miles (92+ km). We have conducted tests and the battery life reached 52+ miles (84+ km), we are very satisfied. How to get this RANDRIDE emtb? You can buy this cost-effective full suspension electric mountain bike from their official website. There are 21 speed gear shift system and 27 speed gear shift system configurations to choose from. No matter which one you choose, you will get six free gifts, and you can also use their Off Code: “LT100” to get $100 USD Off. The minimum price is only US$1,849, and you don’t need to pay any extra shipping and taxes. You just need to wait for the ebike to be delivered to your door at home.
