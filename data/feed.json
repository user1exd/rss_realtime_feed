The recently wowed spectators at the Cannes premiere of showing up to the Croisette in a sheer blue corset gown with sparkling details. She topped off her custom design by Cong Tri with perfectly matched Gianvito Rossi heels and Gabriel & Co. fine jewels, finishing everything off with an icy manicure in the shade Glacier. “My first Cannes,” she about the look. “To the [L'Oréal Paris] team, THANK YOU! I am typing this with the biggest smile on my face. And thank you [Cong Tri] for this custom gown, I felt sexy, and felt like a princess. Didn’t know both at the same time were achievable.” While the ice princess vibes were definitely strong, King's cascading blonde waves gave the arctic look a bit of a mermaid twist—but it wasn't to last. Joey King on May 24, 2024. Other than referencing her icy debut with crystal-dripping opera gloves, Joey King completely transformed for Cannes Film Festival's closing ceremony on May 25, showing up on the red carpet in a yellow keyhole column dress and brand-new, ultra-short mushroom bob. “Custom @miumiu & a chop for Cannes day 2 with @lorealparis,” King , lest you questioned if she was somehow hiding her length for the aesthetic. Hey, celebs ! Joey King on May 25, 2024. Nope, Joey King's bob appears to be the real deal, despite what one follower . For her latest red carpet moment, she sported a middle-part, with the ends curved towards her jaw and one side of her bob tucked behind her ear. Let's take a closer look: Joey King on May 25, 2024. Clearly, Joey King was looking to make an impact at the French film festival—and this bold transformation certainly did the trick.",

        "content": "THE British Library is being plagued by randy book lovers romping in loos. Bosses have been forced to call in cops to try to put a stop to the novel use of the venue. One bookworm complained to the library, describing the between-the-sheets bonkbusting as “totally unacceptable”. He said security chiefs had confirmed that bosses were aware of randy students and local workers foolscapping around in the toilets after arranging book-ups online. A post on a “cruisers” website — which The Sun is not naming — advertises the library as being a meeting spot for casual sex with a “vast amount of toilets” on site. But it warns hardback fans that there are regular police and security patrols of the building and there had been cases reported of bonk lovers caught during a private reading being escorted from the site. Last night the distinguished library at London’s King’s Cross denounced the unliterary conduct. A spokesperson said: “The British Library is a public institution and our site at St Pancras is visited by more than one million people every year. “All of the Library’s public areas and facilities, including the toilets, are regularly patrolled by on-site security staff to ensure that they are being used appropriately. “Inappropriate behaviour is not tolerated and the Library works closely with the police to ensure the safety and security of the Library’s buildings and users.”",

        "content": "Cutting or suspending dividends, even when it’s necessary, is rarely well-received by investors. The existing investors of a business that cuts its dividends experience a reduction in their dividend-based income. A drop in the company valuation also accompanies it because an exodus of investors often follows dividend cuts. In extreme cases, the sell-out frenzy may reduce the company’s valuation to a fraction of its former self. However, most of this pertains to the existing investor base, and new investors may perceive a company that recently cut its dividends a bit differently. One such company is ( ), and it might be worth looking into. The dividend cut, reasons, and reaction Earlier this year, Innergex announced it would cut its dividends by half. It paid about $0.18 by the end of 2023, and starting in 2024, the company is only paying about $0.09 per share. One main reason behind the dividend cut was that they were becoming unsustainable, owing to the company’s weak finances. In some quarters, they ate up the company’s free cash flow, forcing it to rely on external financial assistance for its projects. The reaction to the dividend cut hasn’t been as aggressive as the reaction many other companies have seen. The stock has dropped less than 3% into the year so far, and the most significant drop happened in February when the stock slumped 24% in 20 days. Overall, the phase has been minimal. Is Innergex still a buy? For people who don’t already have Innergex in their portfolio, the stock may be worth considering for several reasons. Despite the dividend cut, the stock comes with a healthy enough yield of about 4%, and if the company gets back on its feet (financially), it may try to restore its dividends to their original level. This means you may experience rapid dividend growth in the next few years. Another reason is that the company might improve its debt profile by funding most of its operations and growth from the now freed-up free cash flow. The third reason is its resilience. It’s one thing for a stock to retain its market value when the market or the sector dips (external hostile forces). However, retaining its value, despite cutting its payouts is resilience on another level. Foolish takeaway One thing to remember about the stock is that it has been in perpetual decline since its peak in Jan. 2021 and is currently trading at a discount of about 71% from that peak value. The dividend cut is more likely to prolong this slump. So, if you are anticipating quick capital appreciation, this may disappoint you.",

With its latest dashboard enhancements, BlockDAG has significantly improved user interactions, elevating standards in cryptocurrency engagement. Bolstered by pioneering innovations and an ambitious price forecast of $30 by 2030, BlockDAG continues to draw keen interest and investment from the crypto community. BNB’s price momentum is strong, having broken through the significant $595 barrier, a price point that had been resistant since March. Currently priced at $623, BNB’s ascent reflects a vibrant purchasing trend, moving beyond the constraints of a previously observed symmetrical triangle pattern, where prices fluctuated between higher lows and lower highs, indicative of market consolidation. This breakthrough has propelled BNB above both its 20-day Exponential Moving Average and 50-day Simple Moving Average, suggesting a clear upward trajectory. This shift in momentum highlights a significant market move towards further coin accumulation. In the realm of digital payments, Litecoin remains a frontrunner, consistently leading in transaction volume on the BitPay platform for five consecutive months. Its dominance is so pronounced that it surpasses the transaction volumes of the next three cryptocurrencies combined, emphasizing its widespread use in digital transactions. The recent weeks have seen substantial investments in Litecoin, including a noteworthy purchase of 900,000 LTC on May 10th. These large transactions, totaling $230 million, demonstrate increasing institutional interest in Litecoin, cementing its status as a vital player in the crypto market. BlockDAG has emerged as a standout in the cryptocurrency presale arena, amassing an impressive $34 million. This surge in interest is largely due to its recent updates, particularly the dashboard revamp which has significantly improved user interaction and transparency on the platform. Furthermore, the updated dashboard introduces new features designed to enhance user engagement and satisfaction. It includes a ‘hot news’ section, which immediately updates users with the latest developments upon logging in, ensuring they are always informed. Additionally, the wallet feature now shows updated balances promptly after any purchase of miners or coins, enhancing user trust and convenience. A newly introduced leaderboard showcases the top 30 investors, highlighting the major players and promoting a competitive investment environment. This feature not only adds a gamification element to investing but also signals potential rewards for top investors, further engaging the community. With these strategic enhancements, BlockDAG not only solidifies its position in the market but also sets the stage for sustained future growth. Market analysts are keeping a keen eye on this trend, with projections pointing to a long-term target price of $30 by 2030. To recap, With BNB breaking through major resistance levels and Litecoin maintaining its lead in digital payments, BlockDAG stands out as the top investment choice. Renowned for its record-breaking $34 million presale, BlockDAG not only improves user interactions with its redesigned dashboard but also offers significant growth prospects. Its strategic enhancements and an ambitious $30 price target by 2030 make this the optimal moment to invest in BlockDAG, positioning it as a premier investment opportunity in the crypto landscape.

        "content": "On Monday afternoon legendary basketball player and commentator Bill Walton after a prolonged battle with cancer. Walton wore a number of hats across a lengthy career in the sports world. He first rose to acclaim as a key piece in John Wooden's dynasty, winning two national championships. Walton helped the Bruins amass 88 consecutive wins -- a men's college basketball record -- across his sophomore, junior and senior seasons in Westwood. Selected with the the top pick in the 1974 NBA draft by the , Walton's success would translate to the professional ranks. He'd win a pair of titles -- with the Trail Blazers in 1977 and in 1986 -- as part of a Hall of Fame career. Walton was the league's MVP in 1977-78 and Sixth Man of the Year in 1985-86. Following his retirement, Walton would make the transition to the broadcast booth, calling NBA games as a lead analyst for ESPN and ABC. He transitioned to college basketball in 2012.

        "description": "Once again, Ronald Acuna Jr will miss time for the Braves with an ACL tear. Who could help replace the reigning NL MVP?",
        "content": "When . blew out his right knee on July 10, 2021, Alex Anthopoulos felt compelled to respond quickly. The Braves' head of baseball operations wanted to send a message to the Atlanta players that the season was not lost -- that the front office and the team should continue to fight. So five days later, Anthopoulos traded for veteran outfielder and catcher , and before the end of the summer, he'd add three more outfielders -- , and . The Braves would go on to win the World Series that fall, with those midseason additions contributing significantly. Now Acuna injury, to his other knee, and again he is out for the season. The Braves' situation is not nearly as dire as it was when Acuna was hurt in '21 -- then, Atlanta was struggling to play .500 ball, and didn't have nearly as deep of a roster as it does now. But this time, the team has to move ahead not only without the reigning National League MVP, but also without its most dominant pitcher, Spencer Strider, who suffered a season-ending elbow injury at the outset of the season. The early success (and good health) of has helped to plug the hole created by Strider's injury. But the Braves' offense -- which had already been in an early funk after setting records for home runs last year -- will need heroes to emerge in the lineup. It might be third baseman , who is expected to return soon from a minor back injury suffered a couple of weeks ago. At that point, Riley had felt that he was just about to emerge from an early-season slump. \"I am close,\" said Riley, holding his index and thumb millimeters apart, as he described how he felt at the plate. Maybe it'll be Braves center fielder Michael Harris II, who knows what it means to dig out of a slump. Last year, Harris was activated off the injured list without taking at-bats in the minors because the staff felt his defense was so important -- and for six weeks, he struggled mightily at the plate. But in his last 100 games, Harris batted .335 with 63 runs, 16 home runs and 15 stolen bases. He could be a natural candidate to ascend into the leadoff spot. All-Star catcher , too, after missing most of the past two months with a rib cage injury. First baseman has already begun to work his way out of a slow start, batting .290 with five homers in his past 16 games. Through his April struggles, Olson had actually generated hard-hit rates that were in line with what he produced last year, but he did not have the results to show for it. His teammates felt he had been the victim of some bad BABIP luck. Many pointed to a game against the Red Sox on May 8: Olson scorched a line drive toward left field that Boston third baseman rose to barely spear. Braves hitting coach Kevin Seitzer could see Olson's shoulders sag with frustration at the sight of yet another intercepted line drive. But Devers couldn't hold the ball, and Olson got a hit. Before the next game, Seitzer spoke to Olson about his reaction to Devers' brief interception. When Olson's shoulders dropped, Seitzer said, it was like he could see that misfortune weighing down the All-Star first baseman. Seitzer told Olson there was no sense clinging to that frustration, because those early-season at-bats were behind him, and he couldn't change the result. \"As far as I'm concerned, the season starts for you today,\" Seitzer said. Hours later, after Olson had clubbed a home run in a series-opening win over the Mets, Seitzer greeted Olson in the handshake line and punctuated his earlier remarks: \"Have a great season.\" Maybe the Braves will get a boost from , or , the talented young outfielder who has swung well in his first season with the Braves. Maybe Duvall, signed late in spring training, will take advantage of the additional playing time he will get. Maybe will continue to carry the offense, as he has for a lot of this season. \"He might be the best hitter in baseball right now,\" Cubs manager Craig Counsell said Sunday as he described a plate appearance that Ozuna had against his team. And it's a certainty that Anthopoulos, reflexively proactive, will scan the trade market and look for opportunities to upgrade, even at a time when his farm system is thinner than that of other contenders. Anthopoulos typically holds some spending flexibility in reserve, and inevitably, other teams will look to dump pricey veterans as they fall out of the race. Sellers will develop, and outfielders will become available. , , , , , Rosario (again) and are among the players on short-term deals who could be moved this year if their respective teams fall out of contention. Braves manager Brian Snitker talked earlier this year about the team's offensive problems and mentioned a trait he sees in the collective mindset of the team. \"These guys will not panic,\" he said. \"They will never panic. Three years ago, we lost Acuna, and these guys just kept going.\" Three years ago, they won the World Series without him. Now the Braves will have to try to do that again.",

        "content": "PAT Sajak has suffered the brunt of one angry contestant who blamed the Wheel of Fortune host for distracting him. But Pat took the accusation in stride, and snarked back at the player. On a recent Wheel of Fortune episode, Michael Bystrzycki, a master electrician from Drummonds, Tennessee , was working his way through a Crossword round, where contestants are asked to solve a series of interconnected words with the same lead-in. In this case, the four words all had \"fire\" as the first part. Michael looked to be about to solve the puzzle, when he suddenly changed course and decided to spin the wheel one more time. He landed on Bankrupt - losing everything. Luckily for him, his turn eventually came again, and after making a comeback, correctly solved Fire - \"works, wood, department, and pit.\" After celebrating his win, Pat wanted to know what was stumping him before. \"Which one were you shaky on the first time?\" he asked, opening a can of worms. \"None. I just looked at you instead of looking at the puzzle, and 'works' went out my head,\" Michael immediately shot back. \"I was like, 'ah, he said spin, so I’m spinning'. Let’s go\". A depressed Pat simply threw his arms up, looked directly at the camera, and snapped back a sarcastic, \"It’s always my fault.\" Michael had the last laugh, however, winning the game - and then the bonus round - leaving the show with a new Infinity car and an overall total of $111,160 in cash and prizes. It wasn't the first time Pat has been called out by a contestant. Late last year, a contestant named Jill failed to solve the final round puzzle, \"Voicing Our Opinion.\" That's when she decided to voice hers . \"Come on,\" she said. Premiering in 1975, the beloved game show has had a few different iconic hosts in its nearly 50 seasons. 1975 - 1981 : Chuck Woolery was the original host of Wheel of Fortune until he departed in 1981. 1981 - June 2024: Pat Sajak took over and became a beloved Wheel of Fortune host for over 40 years. September 2024: Ryan Seacrest was declared the newest host as Sajak announced his retirement . Pat seemed caught off guard and replied, \"What do you mean, come on?\" She turned to the host and flat-out asked, \"What kind of puzzle is that?\" Pat looked shocked by the pushback and held a finger up. \"It’s a puzzle you didn’t solve,\" he slammed back, causing the audience to roar in laughter. Jill missed out on an additional $40,000 per the glitzy prize card but still got her existing $27,680. Pat won't have to play the victim for much longer. The 77-year-old announced last year that he’s retiring from the game show at the end of this 41st season, which is now only days away . In June 2023, Pat revealed he would soon be leaving the show, and it was announced soon after that Ryan Seacrest would be taking over as host. Almost a year later, Pat’s final episode of Wheel of Fortune is almost here. The big finale was filmed last month and is currently set to air on June 7 . With Pat now readying to leaving, the show has prepared a series of tributes. The weeklong goodbye will be called Thanks for the Memories and will culminate with his final episode.",

        "content": "Tom Brady seemed ready to hit the summer vibes with his kids that he shares with his ex-wife Gisele Bündchen, just after jokes from his Netflix special, The Roast of Tom Brady , went viral and upset some people. The retired NFL star posted a clip on Instagram on Monday, showing off himself having some fun in the water, enjoying good times with two of his kids, Benjamin, 14, and Vivian, 11. “You guys okay if we get summer started? Hope everyone is having a great MDW!,” he captioned the clip, which had Post Malone and Morgan Wallen's I Had Some Help playing in the background. The 46-year-old flexed his ripped body in the video post while driving a speedboat, jet-skiing and wakeboarding. Glimpses showed his kids also joining in on the fun. The sports personality’s beach vacation comes just days after Brady’s Netflix roast that mocked fun at his personal life. The Super Bowl champ, who shares a son, Jack, 16, with ex-Bridget Moynahan, admitted he “didn’t like” how his children were “affected” by jokes targeted st his exes. “I loved when the jokes were about me,” he confessed on The Pivot podcast. “I thought they were so fun. I didn’t like the way that affected my kids.”",

        "description": "The 2024 Indianapolis 500 delivered one of the most compelling races in the sport's history...",
        "content": "After an epic rainstorm and four hours of delays, the 2024 Indianapolis 500 delivered one of the most compelling races in the sport’s history. Josef Newgarden of Team Penske may have crossed the yard of bricks in first position, but a simple finishing order never quite tells the full story when a race lasts for 200 fascinating laps that saw 49 lead changes and a record 18 different leaders. The 108th running of the Indy 500 created hundreds of fascinating storylines, but today, we’re going to recap the biggest winners — and the biggest losers. WINNER: Josef Newgarden and Team Penske It hasn’t been a good year to be a Team Penske driver. Both Josef Newgarden and Scott McLaughlin were disqualified from the season opening race at St. Petersburg, Florida for illegally utilizing Push to Pass, which provides limited bursts of boost to aid in overtaking, on restarts. Newgarden, who utilized that system illegally more than anyone else, lost his win at the race and faced down a massive amount of criticism for hosting an emotional press conference where he insisted that he did not cheat. The whole affair has soured many fans; even though Newgarden and McLaughlin were disqualified, and even though Team Penske suspended several critical team members for two races (including the Indy 500), there’s a large group of folks who feel that that wasn’t enough — especially because team owner Roger Penske also owns the IndyCar Series and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. There’s a lot of speculation that this cheating scandal is a conspiracy, and that there are simply far too many conflicts of interest. It’ll be difficult for Penske and Newgarden to completely leave this affair in the past, but it’s also difficult to argue that Newgarden and Team Penske did not deserve their victory — the 20th 500 win for Roger. Newgarden’s masterful back-to-back performance at the Greatest Spectacle in Racing, however, is a step in the right direction. LOSER: Honda Of the 11 drivers that retired from the 2024 Indianapolis 500, nine were Honda-powered. Of those nine Honda retirements, three were mechanical failures. The two Chevrolet retirements were solely due to contact. It’s a bitter pill to swallow for the Honda camp; the Japanese manufacturer struggled throughout the entire month of May. While Honda’s teams appeared to have strong race pace in practice, its qualifying effort was poor: All six drivers in the first two rows of the grid were Chevy drivers, and all four of the slowest drivers competing for the final three grid slots were Honda drivers. In the race itself, only three Honda drivers finished in the top 10. David Salters, president of Honda Racing Corporation USA, said, “It was a disappointing day. All things considered, we weren’t good enough on the day. We’ll regroup, lick our wounds, focus our efforts, and come back.” Prior to the race, Salters joined a media availability session for journalists who had been invited as guests of Honda. During that session, he admitted that the debut of hybrid engines had required some compromises in terms of Indy 500 preparation, and that Honda had actually fallen behind performance expectations when it came time to compete at the Speedway. The answers for the drop in performance are not immediately available, but it certainly doesn’t bode well for Honda, which is currently rumored to be looking for an IndyCar exit strategy. WINNER: Pato O’Ward No, this placement isn’t a mistake — despite losing an almost guaranteed win after an audacious last-lap pass from Newgarden, Arrow McLaren driver Pato O’Ward has every right to be devastated. He also has every right to be included on the winner list. At 25 years old, O’Ward has actively raced in five Indy 500s and has performed admirably in every single one. In his debut race, he finished sixth. He followed that with a fourth-place finish in 2021, then a second in 2022. His 24th-place classification in 2023 doesn’t quite tell the story of his battle for the lead and unfortunate crash within the final 10 laps. This year, he passed Newgarden on the final lap; in every other year, that would have meant victory. In 2024. It wasn’t enough. O’Ward exited the car with a heavy heart and heavier sobs, offering heartbreaking interviews to the media. And yet O’Ward has matured immensely, both in IndyCar as a whole and at the Indy 500, over the past few years. The Mexican driver had produced stunning performances and many equally stunning crashes thanks to his fiery demeanor; his 2023 victory in the 500 was almost assured until he crashed in attempting to pass Marcus Ericsson. This year, O’Ward’s drive was just as inspired, but it was far more measured. His racing line in the final stages sliced apexes and set him up for perfect passes. It wasn’t enough, but an O’Ward of a different year may very well have wrecked himself and the leader trying to win. It was a devastating result, but O’Ward should be proud. He has a long and impressive career ahead of him at the Speedway. LOSER: Kyle Larson All things considered, NASCAR star Kyle Larson had an impressive debut at the Indianapolis 500. Despite accruing a penalty for speeding in the pit lane, he completed all 200 laps and took home an 18th-place finish for his efforts. He committed to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway despite the rain and raced incredibly well. He has much to be proud of. But Larson has stumbled onto our losers list for one big reason: His attempt at completing the “Double” — or, racing in the Indy 500 followed by NASCAR’s Coca-Cola 600 — was squashed by poor weather and NASCAR politics. Larson stuck around for the 500’s four-hour rain delay and completed the event, then immediately jetted off to Charlotte Motor Speedway. He arrived at the track just as the race was flagged for weather. Because NASCAR had completed half distance, and because humidity in the area was set to make track drying problematic, and because it was already late, NASCAR called the race. Larson wasn’t able to turn a single lap. Now, he may be facing a slew of repercussions. At this time of writing, NASCAR has not provided Larson with a “waiver” that approves his missing the Coca-Cola 600. As a result, there is still a chance that Larson will be entirely disqualified from the NASCAR Championship because he failed to compete in one race — even though it wasn’t his fault. Many pundits in the NASCAR sphere are also actively arguing that Larson be denied a waiver, angry because one of their finest drivers had prioritized another race in another series over the Cup Series. Rather than celebrate his performance, they demand punishment (especially as other drivers like Ryan Blaney toy with the idea of attempting the same feat in the future). This may be Larson’s last attempt at completing the Double — and it may also spell the end of any attempts in the future. 👉 F1 v IndyCar: Top speeds, engines, formats, calendars and safety measures all compared 👉 Which drivers are paid the most? F1, IndyCar and NASCAR salaries revealed WINNER: Scott Dixon Qualifying did not look good for Scott Dixon. The six-time IndyCar champion and one-time 500 winner qualified on the outside of the seventh row for the 108th running of the event. Despite starting 21st, he finished third. As we noted before, Honda’s engines just weren’t cut out for the task of winning the 500 this year; if they had been, Dixon’s exceptional performance would have set him up as a dominant victor. He was one of a few drivers that tried an alternate pit strategy, and luck played into his favor as his competition retired. He carved through the field and was briefly one of the race’s 18 leaders, showing yet again that he is truly one of the finest open-wheel racers in the world. LOSER: Katherine Legge Katherine Legge made her Indy 500 return in 2023 after nine years away from the track, but her race ended in disappointment. She returned to IMS in 2024 seeking redemption, but her Dale Coyne Racing No. 51 machine let her down: on lap 23, Legge slowed on the track as smoke poured from the rear of her car. Her engine had failed, and she would retire from the race after just 57 of its 500 miles. While Legge wasn’t the only Honda driver to face an engine issue, her result was uniquely disappointing. The 44-year-old was the only woman in the field, and one of only nine women to ever compete at Indianapolis. She arrived for a one-off attempt at the race with ample backing from sponsor e.l.f. Cosmetics and served as a huge inspiration to female fans around the globe. It is unclear if Legge will return for another shot at the race; it would be truly disappointing for her Indianapolis efforts to end in back-to-back retirements after breaking so many records and being such a fantastic ambassador for the sport. WINNER: e.l.f. Cosmetics Even though e.l.f. Cosmetics driver Katherine Legge exited the race early, the brand was a serious winner of the Indy 500 this year. The makeup brand sponsored Legge in 2023, then came back to provide a primary partnership in 2024. Further, e.l.f. signed on as a partner of the 2024 Indy 500 and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Its investment in the sport was clear. Not only did e.l.f. put on an exceptional drone show over downtown Indianapolis on the Saturday night before the race, but it also developed a massive “lip oil change” fan activation in the infield. There, fans of all kinds could get a makeover, enter a contest to win a year’s supply of lip oil, learn about the nine women who have contested the Indy 500, and collect sample products and Legge-specific merchandise items. The merchandise itself included scarves, hats and magnets while the samples were as generic as sunscreen and lip balm, or as glamorous as mascara and plumping lipstick. Of all the activations in the fan area — which included displays from other sponsors like Good Ranchers and Verizon — the e.l.f. display was both the most elaborate and the most well attended. It was the only activation that actively provided an experience and products designed for a female audience, but it was just as welcoming for the men who perused its offerings. The sponsorship represents a shift in motorsport demographics; while women have always watched and competed in racing, few sponsors (outside of, say, lingerie companies) have actually considered their wants or needs. Now, women are so prevalent in the racing world that big-name woman-focused brands like e.l.f. can see a benefit in investing time, money, and resources into motorsport because it knows it can see a return on its investment. That’s a huge win for e.l.f., for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and for women involved in motorsport around the world. LOSER: Colton Herta Colton Herta is notorious for both his bad luck and his small mistakes — neither of which ever seem to strike at the same time. His 2024 season has been one of his most consistent yet, and during the first half of the 2024 Indy 500, he looked like an exceptional contender for the lead after putting on a promising show in practice. Unfortunately for the Californian driver, he lost control of his car on the entry to Turn 1 on lap 86. While he did appear to save it momentarily, a second bump of oversteer meant Herta careened into the wall. He had fought his way up from 13th to second before losing control. Herta’s Andretti Autosport team brought the car back to the garage, where it deemed the damage to be repairable. Herta ultimately finished 170 of the race’s 200 laps and was classified as the 23rd-place finisher — but it was a serious blow to one of the fastest Honda drivers of the race. WINNER: The Fans When a race is delayed several hours for severe weather, it can be a challenge to keep fans both safe and happy. This year, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway proved why it remains one of the finest sporting venues in the world with its handling of the rain delay. First and foremost, when it became clear earlier this month that weather may impact the 500, IMS rented the high-powered jet dryers that NASCAR uses to clear its tracks of moisture. On the day of the race, it provided fans with ample safe areas to seek shelter and a long heads-up to get there. Track cell service and WiFi remained strong, and as the lightning cleared, a group of dedicated fans organized foot races that drew huge crowds and kept the atmosphere buzzing. The track dried quickly, IMS still provided a tradition-packed pre-race show, and when the green flag finally flew, it felt just as special as any other race day. The exceptional show was simply the cherry on top of a stress-free and impressively organized event. LOSER: Meyer Shank Racing Oh, Meyer Shank Racing. The plucky team has had one of its finest years yet in IndyCar racing, boasting one pole position and securing several top-10 finishes — and it looked set to replicate that performance in the Indy 500. Félix Rosenqvist was one of the three Hondas in the Fast 12 qualifying session, but he was one of several Honda drivers to suffer engine issues on race day. Meanwhile, sportscar ace Tom Blomqvist embarrassed the team with a first-lap crash. He dropped below the white line in Turn 1 and, as he lost control, he crashed into Marcus Ericsson. Pietro Fittipaldi and Callum Ilott made contact trying to avoid the wreck, bringing out the first caution of the race — and becoming the first three retirements in the 500. That left the team’s hopes in the hands of four-time 500 winner Hélio Castroneves. The Brazilian had a beastly run in the race, passing five cars in as many laps and racing hard to make up for his 20th-place starting position. Unfortunately, he suffered a poor pit stop that saw him lose out on all that hard work. He crossed the line in 20th.

Along with these old shots, some newer ones were also included, one of them being a selfie of the two in Europe with a prepossessing water view. The actress captioned the wholesome post as follows, \"Today marks 23 years married to the love of my life. Still giddy to be stuck with you, Henchy!\" Well-known friends of the model were quick to express their happiness for the couple, one of them being Debi Mazar who chimed in by stating, “\"Love you both!

        "description": "Sinn Féin has knocked back a Green party plan for Belfast City Council to go vegan.",
        "content": "At a recent council committee meeting in City Hall the parties went up against each other over a motion by the Greens to impose a “fully plant-based procurement” on council buildings. The Strategic Policy and Resources Committee nevertheless voted for council officers to prepare a report looking at how a vegan policy would be costed and implemented. The Green motion states the council “agrees to engage with the Plant Based Councils initiative and to commit to fully plant-based procurement where food is served throughout the council estate, prioritising seasonal local produce to support local farmers, and ensure that there are plant-based food options available at all city council run events, as well as prioritising plant-based menu options in council run facilities.” Green councillor Anthony Flynn, who proposed the motion, told the committee he was asking for a “feasibility” report on the proposal. “This aligns with our obligations in the Belfast Agenda, in terms of tackling health inequalities and increasing our city’s resilience to climate change, as well as the Belfast City Council declaration of a climate emergency in 2019,” he said. “One of the recommendations in the 2021 UK National Food Strategy recommended that local authorities ensure that ratepayer money is spent on healthy and sustainable foods. “Vegan or plant-based diets are better for the environment as they produce a quarter of the emissions compared to diets including meat, less than half of the water consumed and less of an impact on water pollution and biodiversity. “Local authorities have a huge role to play in helping inform the public in making healthy and sustainable food choices. “Belfast Healthy Cities says that reviewing procurement policies for transport and food could enhance health and sustainability for people and the planet.” Sinn Féin councillor Ronan McLaughlin said he “would have some problems” in terms of procurement, as it would see the council “having to deal with plant based caterers, which would narrow the market, and increase the general overall cost”. “I am happy with having options, but this is supposed to be a just transition, it is not about forcing people to eat plant based food, they should be doing it for their own reasons, not because an authority tries to impose it onto them,” he added. “It should be about people making the right choices through an education process, not through a forced process. “And I would be worried about the cost. In terms of the current climate, the cost of living crisis, I don’t think we can agree to increase the catering budget of the council. I don’t think the public would stand for that. I don’t think it is a good look at all.” Green councillor Brian Smyth said: “What councillor Flynn is asking for is reasonable. He is asking for a report to come back – if there are issues with procurement they will be set out. “That is fair, there are lots of things that go to report and come back with options, and people say further down the line it isn’t for us.” Sinn Féin councillor Micheal Donnelly said council catering free meals and drink for councillors at full council meetings and committee was “a bit outdated.” He asked for a report on “cost implications” of feeding the 60 Belfast councillors at every meeting with a view to ending it. He said: “We are big and ugly enough to feed ourselves if we are hungry, and grab a sandwich before we go to a committee or full council.” The committee also agreed to look at costs for councillor food.",

        "content": "NFL icon Tom Brady looks fitter than ever. The ex- New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback, 46, recently shared a video of himself enjoying the Memorial Day weekend. And the clip put Brady 's remarkable physique on full display. The seven-time Super Bowl champion could be seen soaking up the rays while doing watersports with his children. The NFL legend also tried some solo wakesurfing and fell off on numerous occasions, causing a big splash. \"You guys okay if we get summer started?\" Brady captioned the post . \"Hope everyone is having a great MDW!\" And fans loved the update – while pointing out that Brady looked ready to return to the field again if he wanted to. \"Tom is looking better than ever,\" one commented. \"Could still come out and toss 4500 and 30 TDs,\" another added. \"Someone looks to be in football shape,\" a third said. \"Tom could win a Super Bowl at 70. Shredded to the gills,\" one wrote. Brady is set to begin his broadcasting career this year as part of his 10-year, $375 million deal with Fox Sports. The retired quarterback will replace Greg Olsen as the network's top color analyst. He will call games alongside play-by-play announcer Kevin Burkhardt in a team that also features sideline reporter Erin Andrews . Andrews recently said she was confident that Brady would do well in the booth. In an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon , the Fox Sports star recalled how Brady kept telling fascinating stories about his career at lunch once. \"And it's stuff we just die for. Love the inside information,\" Andrews said. \"And you are hearing stuff that you've just always wanted to know. And my knee was just bouncing.\" Andrews' colleague and podcast partner Charissa Thompson was also sure that Brady would be just fine behind the mic. \"His resume supports that he is great at everything he does,\" Thompson noted. \"So why would this be any different?\"",

        "content": "Josh is joined by Sophie Walker on this week's episode of the Sky Sports Golf podcast to reflect on the tragic news of Grayson Murray's death, before previewing the US Women's Open and hearing from Eddie Pepperell in a wide-ranging interview. It was announced over the weekend that two-time PGA Tour winner Murray passed away on Saturday after withdrawing late in his second round of the Charles Schwab Challenge on Friday. Murray's family confirmed in a statement that the 30-year-old had taken his own life after previously speaking openly about his struggles with mental health and alcoholism. \"Everybody thinks that professional golf is the best job in the world, just because you've got all the stuff, all the money, all the trophies, life must be good right? Sometimes it's not and it's a battle in your own mind,\" said Sophie Walker. \"Maybe listening to some of the stuff he said some of us might have thought he'd won that battle, but I don't think you ever do. It's a constant thing and it makes me so sad he was that low. \"It's horrible to think that's your only option.\" Tributes have poured in from across the world of golf as the sport remembers the influence of Murray, who has previously taken time to open himself up to messages from others who might have been struggling with their mental health. \"I often say, some of the lads I've played with, when I see them on the course on Tour they look like super men,\" said Walker. \"Their clothes are fresh out of the packet, their shoes, they walk around and look six foot five etc, but you're trying to put on a show for yourself in order to be as confident as possible. \"There's nothing quite like not playing well and going back to a hotel room alone and being left with your own thoughts. \"Pro golfers I think speak quite negatively to themselves at the best of times, and you would never say what you say to yourself to somebody else. \"When things are going well your phone blows up, when they aren't it's a really quiet place.\" You can listen to more by downloading the latest Sky Sports podcast via Spotify , Spreaker or Apple Podcasts .

Canadian Press May 27, 2024 12:56 PM Share by Email Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Print Share via Text Message Alberta's police watchdog says there will be no criminal charges for two police officers who broke rules when they surveilled NDP legislature member Shannon Phillips. Phillips speaks as Rachel Notley looks on at an announcement in Calgary, Monday, March 15, 2021. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntosh EDMONTON — Two police officers who broke rules when they surveilled a legislature member won't face charges, even though there are reasonable grounds to believe they committed a crime, says the province's law enforcement watchdog. In a letter to the lawyer for Lethbridge New Democrat MLA Shannon Phillips, the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team says the provincial prosecution service has declined to take the matter to court. \"(The agency) determined that there were reasonable grounds to believe that two officers had committed criminal offences by accessing Ms. Phillips' data,\" reads the letter, dated May 17. \"The investigative materials concerning two officers were forwarded to the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service to determine whether their test for prosecution was met. (The agency) received an opinion back that (the service's) test for prosecution was not met and therefore these individuals will not be charged.\" The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team has not yet filed its full report on the investigation. \"(The agency) will soon be producing a public-facing report containing our investigative conclusions,\" the letter says. In 2017, Phillips, who was then environment minister, was discussing a proposed new park with a constituent in a coffee shop and was overheard by Lethbridge officer Keon Woronuk. Woronuk, a local all-terrain-vehicle user, was concerned that what he heard might have an impact on his hobby. Woronuk subsequently posted photos of the meeting on a Facebook page under the name \"Mike Corps,\" which included identifying the stakeholders and a long caption criticizing Phillips and the NDP government. That prompted Phillips to complain to Calgary police, who found Woronuk had conducted an unauthorized database search. Calgary police then passed the investigation on to Medicine Hat police. Woronuk was later convicted of five counts of violating the Police Services Act. They included wrongly subjecting Phillips to a police database search, singling her and others out for traffic enforcement, misleading supervisors and using his position as an officer for political reasons. The other officer, Jason Carrier, also an off-road enthusiast, was convicted on two counts of the police act — being an accessory to Woronuk's offences and failing to report them. In 2020, both men received temporary demotions. Woronuk was demoted for two years and Carrier for one year. Phillips appealed the sentences, but they were upheld. She has also filed a lawsuit against the Lethbridge Police Service. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. The Canadian Press See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

        "content": "The Imo State Command of the Nigeria Police has confirmed the rank demotion of one of its officers caught extorting money from motorists along the Owerri-Onitsha express road. The officer, identified as Inspector Isong Osudueh, was captured in a viral video collecting money from drivers on the busy road and, in some cases, handing them change. The officer’s extortion video, attached to the Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU), has continued to generate criticism from social media users, with many condemning the act in its entirety. Reacting to the development on Monday, the Imo State Commissioner of Police, Aboki Danjuma, described the act as shameful and unprofessional. In a statement made available by the Command’s Public Relations Officer, ASP Henry Okoye, CP Danjuma stated that the demotion became important to maintain his officers’ highest professionalism. ALSO READ: Two feared killed in Lagos Police station attack The statement also revealed that the supervisory officer in charge of monitoring the activities of the erring officer was issued an official query for lack of supervision. The Imo State Commissioner of Police, however, enjoined the state’s residents not to relent in their efforts to continuously support the police and other security agencies with timely information. The statement partly reads, “The disciplinary actions taken against the erring officer underscore the Command’s unwavering commitment to maintaining the highest standards of professionalism, transparency, and integrity among its personnel while effectively discharging its lawful duties and entrenching public trust and confidence. “While strongly condemning the embarrassing act, the Commissioner of Police, CP Aboki Danjuma, reiterates that the Command under his watch will not condone any act of extortion or misconduct by its personnel and warns that any supervisory officer who fails to carry out his oversight duties will be severely sanctioned.”",

        "description": "There is a growing number of Brits exploring relationships involving multiple partners. One couple have told the Mirror how their open marriage works for them",
        "content": "Hacking on an industrial scale exposed the personal details of 30 million users of the Ashley Madison dating site for married people looking to cheat - resulting in heartbreak, divorce and even suicide. But neither the 2015 hack, nor the new Netflix docuseries, Ashley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal, examining the subsequent fall-out, have dampened its customers' ardour. Now, nine years after the personal data became public, Ashley Madison - described as “only for married people” and claiming to be “the first married dating website” - has millions of customers. It also welcomes people in “open relationships’ like husband-and-wife Chu Nim and Su Perez, who completely understand the allure of extra-marital sex - although they never cheat. The super glam couple have an open marriage The pair have been married for years ( Image: Collect) Instead, the London-based parents, who met on the dancefloor of the Liquid & Envy nightclub in Romford, Essex, in 2008, juggle kids, work, sex parties and throuples...together. Chu, 37, tells the Mirror : \"One night we were out, really drunk, and a friend stayed over. We were like ‘Should we bring this person in?’ “Obviously, it was very scary at the time. The funny thing was we hadn’t even spoken to this person, they were oblivious.” According to Chu, everyone was in the bedroom when he suddenly asked their friend if he wanted to sleep with his wife. “They didn’t think it was real until we made it real,” he says. Su, 44, adds: “It was just me getting involved. There was no sexual connection between the two men, it was just me with them. “It went really well. The morning was awkward, he went out and brought us breakfast! “But it didn’t change anything about us or our friendship.” Away from their unorthodox sex life, the couple look after their 12-year-old son and Su’s 23-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. She is disabled and Su is her carer, as well as being an events manager, while Chu is a manager at a private jet business. The pair say it strengthens their relationship ( Image: Collect) Chu and Su discussed it for years before going ahead - and say communication is key ( Image: Collect) They both say that sleeping with other people strengthens their connection and keeps their sex life sizzling. Enjoying an open marriage by mutual consent, without any deception, they say they don’t need Ashley Madison. The couple, whose first sexual experience as a throuple was in 2018, generally sleep with another woman. When they involve another man, he makes love to Su, but not to Chu. “Chu always says he just likes me enjoying myself and having pleasure. He doesn’t get involved, but it works for us,” says Su. In a practice known as “unicorn hunting” - when a usually heterosexual couple seeks a third and generally bisexual female partner to join a threesome - they normally involve a woman. Despite their unconventional marriage, their courtship was fairly standard, with Su saying of their first meeting: “I don’t believe in love at first sight, but I do believe something happened. They used to be very traditional “Then we just kept bumping into each other and we moved quickly. We became friends really quickly and I think that's the basis of any relationship - we’re best friends.” The pair held a Chinese marriage service in 2011, the day before Valentine’s Day, attended by friends and family. They then officially registered their nuptials two years ago, after marrying again in Las Vegas. For several years they were quite traditional, with Su making Chu promise not to visit any strip clubs in Amsterdam on his stag do. She says: “I literally said ‘I only have one condition - do not go to the strip clubs.’ “The way I saw it was that if you’ve found the one, I should be the one forever. You shouldn’t even need to look anywhere else.” When Chu was “dragged” to a sex show - but not a strip club - on his stag night, Su threatened to call off their big day, before cooling down. But everything changed two years later when they started visiting Miami for work. Su says: “The sex culture there is very big - especially in the clubs. One of the first nights, we went with some friends to a strip club and I remember saying ‘Enjoy yourself but respect me.’” Chu adds: “Su made it really clear to me from the get-go and I really understood. It’s not about the girls, it’s about how I make her feel in that scenario. “We can be very comfortable and say ‘that girl is beautiful’ or ‘that man looks amazing’, but you need to have a foundation of understanding.” On one Miami trip, the pair shared a private lap dance and “the penny dropped”, says Su, as she watching her husband’s reaction. They first explored their fantasies in Miami ( Image: Collect) Su was fuming when Chu attended a sex show in Amsterdam “It was very sensual,” she says. “I enjoyed watching him enjoy it, and he enjoyed me enjoying it. And it progressed to us fantasising about situations.” But boundaries are key. They discuss everything before involving other people. “I think you can get very lost in the moment and think ‘let’s just do it’ but it’s not necessarily the right move,” says Su. Looking back at the night in Miami, Chu adds: “There was lots of discussion - ‘is it just a fantasy, do we want to make it real?’” And when they eventually invited a woman to join them, Su says there was a “completely different dynamic” in the bedroom. “The first time, it was just me, but the second time we were both involved.” Watching Chu make love to another woman didn’t make her jealous. She says: “For me, it’s about making me feel that I’m there. That even if he’s having sex with another woman, I’m the most important person in the room. I need to be present.” The extra-marital activity bonds them more than threatening their relationship, according to Su, who adds: “It brings you closer together. You enjoy each other in a very different way.” Meanwhile, Chu admits that enjoying intimacy with two women is “amazing.” He says: “If someone does something wrong, we sit down and we make sure it doesn’t happen again. “Obviously, boundaries can be blurred, especially in the heat of the moment, as there’s a different part of the brain making decisions.” It has helped discovering that friends they already had are, in fact, swingers. Chu says: “We thought it was just us. The pair have enjoyed sex parties before - but prefer to be a bit more selective “By absolute happenstance, some of our closest friends that we’ve known for 20 years are swingers.” And while they haven’t ruled sex parties out, they have been enjoying more intimate encounters like those described. Chu says: “There’s different types of open relationships. We don’t play separately, it’s all about being together. “So, we’ve been moving back to our own kind of thing, using certain websites, and even escorts. Just to make life easy.” Understanding each other’s needs is of paramount importance before an open relationship can work, according to Su. And when Chu, who is gregarious, organised some “hook-ups” and she felt left out, she told him. She says: “I realised it wasn’t making me comfortable, that I needed it to be on my terms. I needed to give the all-clear. “You’re still a couple and a family. It’s all about enhancing parts of your life.” These days, when they’re in the mood for a third person, they might call on a friend to join them. But they’ve managed to form lasting friendships with some people they have enjoyed casual sex with. Despite their openness, they do exercise caution when talking to other people about their open marriage. Chu says: “If people ask, I’ll never lie, but I’m not mentioning it in the office.” Similarly, they don’t advertise their unconventional sex life to their children - although they say they will answer age-appropriate questions if asked. The pair say there's a lot of incorrect assumptions about open relationships out there And Su is keen to dispel the image of people looking for three-way sex being kinky, “old and wrinkly.” She says: “It’s a massive misconception that everyone in this world is old and wrinkly and an exhibitionist. “There are a lot of young trendy people. Unfortunately, not a lot of people understand it. But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t work for us. “A lot of people think that if you do this with somebody else it's because you're not happy in your marriage. “I completely disagree. I think the happier you are in a marriage, the easier it is to do this, as you trust each other.” Classified site, Vivastreet , connects people with casual encounters and more Shoppers say £19 wrinkle-filling cream gives ‘amazing’ results on fine lines in four days",

        "content": "In recent weeks, GIFs sent by iPhone users to Android devices running Google Messages have turned into distorted still images with missing dots/pixels throughout. This issue — with reports continuing to come in — has been encountered on Pixel, Samsung, and other Android phones. All the GIFs have been sent over SMS/MMS by iPhone owners. While more than a few Android users have reported this issue, not every iPhone-Android conversation is impacted. GIFs we sent in testing today appear normally in Google Messages. Meanwhile, one case described how they had this problem but other Android users in the same group chat received GIFs from iPhone owners without issue. Credit: u/Diiiiirty, u/ForwardMotion6565 Given the wide range of devices and carriers, it’s unlikely to be an Android OS issue. It could be a problem with the Google Messages app, but we have yet to find Android-to-Android instances. As such, iOS is the most likely culprit. A compression or rendering bug might be at fault. Reports about this distorted iPhone GIF issue increased in mid-May , though some Android users say it has been happening for a few weeks before that. One thing worth noting is how Apple released iOS 17.5 on May 13 , with beta testing starting on April 2 . This issue comes ahead of Apple’s work to adopt RCS on the iPhone. We’re expecting it to launch later this year . The first beta of iOS 18 should arrive next month at WWDC 2024, but it’s unclear if RCS will be enabled on those first previews.

        "content": "Cannes security guard, previously embroiled in a dispute with Kelly Rowland, is now accused of disrespecting Korean actress Yoona. The K-pop star-turned-actress was reportedly halted from posing for red carpet photos on the iconic Cannes stairs by the same security guard. This incident follows closely on the heels of the confrontation with Rowland, where the Destiny's Child alum hinted at racial bias. While the guard's colleagues defended her actions as simply 'doing her job,' fans uncovered another video showcasing Yoona receiving similar treatment. Despite her composed demeanor, her facial expressions betrayed her evident discomfort and annoyance as she was escorted away from the stairs by the female staffer. In the latest developments at the Cannes Filmd Festival, the controversy surrounding the behavior of a particular security guard has escalated, drawing attention to alleged instances of disrespect towards celebrities and attendees. Among the incidents that have sparked widespread criticism, a Ukrainian model found herself in a heated altercation with the same guard, resulting in an expulsion from the red carpet. The model, visibly determined to reclaim her place on the iconic Cannes stairs, engaged in a physical confrontation with the worker. Furthermore, Massiel Taveras, a Dominican actress, became embroiled in a similar clash with the female guard in question, echoing the confrontational atmosphere.",

        "content": "ESPN's Stephen A. Smith has fired back after being called out by an NBA Hall of Famer. Two-time NBA champion Isiah Thomas called out Smith on social media after he criticized Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown on First Take . The Celtics are currently knee-deep in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers , with Brown and Co. leading the series 3-0. Following their 133-128 Game 1 win, Smith took to First Take to share a brutal note he'd been sent by \"an NBA source\" regarding Brown - who was recently controversially snubbed from the All-Star lineups. \"It's not so much that he's underrated; it's that he's just not liked because of his 'I-am-better-than-you attitude,'\" Smith said. \"He knows it. It's the same reason he is not as marketable as he should be.\" Thomas, however, was far from impressed with this take, taking to X, formerly known as Twitter , to defend the 27-year-old. \"I have been a friend, mentor and advisor to @FCHWPO since he was a student at UC Berkeley he is 100 percent marketable and before you slander his name @stephenasmith tell your source to put their name on it or don't speak on it,\" Thomas said . \"Let it be known.\" But Smith also wasn't going to take this criticism lying down, also taking to X to reply to Thomas. \"I have no idea what you're talking about @IsiahThomas,\" he said . \"I have been a fan of Jaylen Brown for years. Still am. What’s unfortunate is that you — who's known for me decades — would choose to go on X to expressed whatever dissent you feel instead of calling me directly. \"But I get it. It's a pattern several folks have used vs me recently, suddenly forgetting communication we've always had. \"So be it. I root for JB always—a great dude and player. But the @celtics have to close the deal.\" As for Brown, he too took to X to respond to Smith , calling on him to \"State your source.\" Smith, though, could not be convinced. He replied saying simply, \"That's not happening. It's journalism. Not revealing sources. Smith then went on to note that later in the aforementioned First Take segment , he and Kendrick Perkins both disagreed with the source. \"The point we were actually discussing is how under appreciated you are and why that may be, which is why I read the quote,\" he added. \"I even brought up how socially conscious you are, and how that may not be liked, knowing you're a good brother. STEPHEN A. Smith is now the face of ESPN and an executive producer on First Take having initially started working for the company back in 2003. Smith has held various roles with the network, including hosting radio shows, SportsCenter contributions, and appearing on NBA Countdown. He was a columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer from 1994 to 2010. His began as an NBA writer before becoming a general sports columnist. Before that, Smith worked as a reporter with Winston-Salem Journal, the Greensboro News, and the New York Daily News. \"Also, that you're a $300M man and you deserve it. But that doesn't mean naysayers don't get heard. That comes with the territory.\" Regardless of who said what, Brown has been impressive as usual during the Conference Finals. In three games he has averaged 30 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 3.3 assists. The Celtics will now have the opportunity to complete the sweep on Monday at 8pm ET. And as for the beef between Smith and Thomas, the latter has attempted to settle the situation in a later tweet. \"All love between you and I @stephenasmith let's talk when time permits,\" he wrote on Sunday. \"Tell your source to stand on their words and not use you to throw their stones.\"",

The Calgary golf professional is gearing up for playing in Canada's lone PGA Tour Champions event of the season while battling inoperable Stage 4 lung cancer. \"You may be handed a death sentence, but it doesn't mean life's over,\" said Blake, whose received the shocking diagnosis in September. \"You've still got a lot to give, so get out there and give something.\" Blake was given a sponsor exemption on Monday, his 56th birthday, to play in his hometown at the 2024 Rogers Charity Classic at Canyon Meadows Golf and Country Club from Aug. 16 to 18. \"The more I have something like this tournament coming up to look forward to, the more alive I feel,\" Blake said. \"I don’t feel like I’m sick. I feel like I’m just this normal guy who’s going to practise for this tournament coming up and hopefully I’ll be around for the next one and so on and so on. \"As devastating as something can sound, I think if you believe that you can conquer something, you will, especially if you have good support staff and family (and) friends.” Blake, who also competed at the PGA Tour Champions event in 2018 when the tournament was known as the Shaw Charity Classic, decided to apply for another exemption while in the midst of undergoing eight months of chemotherapy treatments. He is looking forward to playing the sport he loves, possibly alongside fellow Canadians Mike Weir and Stephen Ames. \"It’s incredible,” Blake said. \"The opportunity, it leaves you speechless obviously to compete again with these guys to be on the same stage. The situation being what it is, they were very open to receive my letter and have me in there.\" A non-smoker with an active lifestyle, Blake developed a nagging cough in August. “I made a deal with my wife that if it did get worse that I would go to the hospital,” said Blake. “Long story short, about 16 hours later and my wife had shown up by that time, sitting in emergency going through a bunch of tests and stuff and they came back with the diagnosis.” Blake faced his prognosis from his oncologist with his family by his side. \"We knew it wasn’t going to be good,” Blake said. \"He said 12 to 24 months, but I kind of really grabbed onto that and said, 'I just want this to be the starting point. Like, I’ll see you in 24 months and then we’ll discuss another prognosis if you’ve got another one for me.' \"Being able to look forward to something like this does so much for me mentally, physically, everything, just to get me psyched up to come out here and compete again.\" The devastating news was a shock to the system for Blake, his wife Kelly and their kids Connor, 25, and Brooklyn, 22, who are both accomplished athletes. \"When we told the kids, they were so emotional as well,\" said Kelly. \"We didn’t know if Steve would be well enough to golf, let alone out here (at Canyon Meadows).\" Connor is a defenceman playing hockey for the ECHL’s Adirondack Thunder, while Brooklyn is a midfielder with Calgary Foothills WFC. \"I’m always looking for something to take my mind off the illness,” said Blake, who works as a financial adviser. “I’m still trying to be very active in work. I’m still trying to be very active in golf and in my kids’ sports and things like that.\" After just missing out on qualifying to compete at the U.S. Senior Open Championship last year, Blake will attempt to earn a spot to play at this year’s tournament to be held at Newport Country Club in Newport, R.I., from June 27 to 30. \"Having something like the U.S. Senior Open qualifier to look forward to again, just the idea of being able to go down and compete, is something that’s really special to me and my wife,\" said Blake, who will tee it up for a qualifying round at Goose Creek Golf Club in Jurupa Valley, Calif., on Tuesday. “I’m fortunate I’ve played (Goose Creek) a couple times. I was close the last time I was down there. Hopefully, I just make a few more putts and we’ll see if we can get in the U.S. Senior Open again.\" Blake played at the major in 2018 at the Broadmoor Golf Club in Colorado Springs, Col. Although he missed the cut with rounds of 79 and 74, it gave him confidence that he could hold his own against the likes of World Golf Hall of Fame members Vijay Singh and Bernhard Langer. \"It’s just such a great opportunity to come out and compete with them,\" said Blake, who carded rounds of 70, 77 and 71 six years ago at Canyon Meadows to finish well back of winner Scott McCarron. \"It’ll be a little different than the last time. It’ll be similar as far as having family and friends and the crowd around, which I so enjoy having. “I know in 2018, it was let’s just not embarrass myself while I’m out here too much. It will be different, just playing for something maybe just a little bit bigger than me. I hope people see the message and see that somebody with an illness like this can still get out there and still pursue their dreams.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.

        "content": "If you are a deeply unpopular incumbent president facing a stern uphill challenge in a bid for re-election (not unlike President Joe Biden) you would like to hit a couple public relations home runs en route to the general election. In lieu of home runs, which can certainly be tough to come by in this hyper-partisan political climate, the next best thing actually isn’t hitting singles or doubles — it’s just avoiding glaring errors. Thanks to a viral Memorial Day clip, the already- Joe Biden now finds himself trying to stave off such an error. As noted, Biden spoke Monday at the Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, as most presidents are wont to do on Memorial Day. And believe it or not, there was little issue with what Biden actually said during his speech. “Freedom has never been guaranteed — every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few and the rights of many,” Biden told those in attendance. “It matters. Our democracy is more than just a system of government. It’s the very soul of America.” Cool. Anyways, the real issue for Biden came up when a viral clip began circulating that showed the president ... less than energized. Is Biden sleeping at the Memorial Day Address?? — The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial) “Is Biden sleeping at the Memorial Day Address?” The Post Millennial asked while sharing a clip of “ Joe.” To answer that outlet’s question: No, it doesn’t appear like Biden was asleep at the wheel (well, ) during this Memorial Day service. It really does look like Biden was closing his eyes in “prayer,” or at least solemn remembrance, for the men and women who’ve given their lives in service to this great country. But the issue isn’t so much the truth of the matter (it’s impossible to tell if he was actually dozing off or not, given Biden appears to generally move at a ), so much as it’s the optics of the matter. It’s that Joe Biden was falling asleep during this moment of remembrance because that’s what 81-year-old men do after anything remotely physically or mentally taxing. They nap. And that’s a generally big problem for Biden. The man could fix the economy and cure cancer tonight, but the fact won’t change that there will always be people dubious of the man’s ability to perform due to the biological realities of aging. And yes, Biden’s chief political rival, former President Donald Trump, isn’t exactly a spring chicken either, but you can’t deny the sheer between the two men. Because of those biological realities, Biden has to outperform expectations to overcome questions about his age. He’s obviously not accomplishing that, if is to be believed. And that’s the real problem with the viral clip of Biden “napping.” Perception shapes reality, and the perception of Biden being a doddering, sleepy old fool very much feels like reality. The president would do well to avoid these types of snafus — even innocent ones like this — if he wants any shot of a second term. (Hah.) We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.",

        "content": "DALLAS — The Timberwolves’ biggest flaw heading into the postseason was quite obvious to anyone who paid attention throughout the course of the regular season: They couldn’t close games. The Wolves were quite literally one of the NBA’s worst teams in clutch-time situations over the back half of the season. Clutch time is defined as the time in the final five minutes of a game in which the margin is within five points. In those situations post-Christmas, the Wolves were outscored by 26.5 points per 100 possessions. Their defense was bad in clutch time, and their offense was worse. Ball holding, indecision and a lack of player movement left the team’s late-game offense often stuck in the muck. Missed shots and turnovers prevented Minnesota from getting back and setting its defense up to its optimal setup, which makes getting stops a chore. ADVERTISEMENT That figured to bite the Timberwolves in the playoffs. But it didn’t through the first two rounds, anyway. Anthony Edwards obliterated Phoenix down the stretch of Game 4 to close out the Wolves’ first-round series sweep in the only competitive game between the two teams. Against Denver, Game 1 and Game 7 were both in doubt in the closing minutes, only to have Minnesota’s offense prove largely unstoppable to secure the first and last victories of the series. The problems appeared to be solved. Until they weren’t. ADVERTISEMENT The late-game issues have reared their ugly heads in the Western Conference Finals. The Wolves led the bulk of the first two games of the series, only to squander advantages late. They rallied in the second half of Game 3 on Sunday and held a two-point lead with five minutes to play after Kyle Anderson’s toss at the hoop dropped to beat the shot clock with 5 minutes, 5 seconds to play. That was the last bucket of consequence the Wolves would score. Minnesota tallied just one point between Anderson’s miraculous shot and Anthony Edwards’ irrelevant layup with 15 seconds to play — a Naz Reid free throw. In between those buckets were seven missed shots and a turnover. Edwards said the ball was sticking too much in the Wolves’ hands, particularly his. “I thought it was our offense that broke down, more than anything. You’ve got to try to score alongside of them,” Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. “We just didn’t execute very well, didn’t find the open guy very well down the stretch. And when we had open looks, they were nowhere near going in.” ADVERTISEMENT It is tough to win that way. As it is when you commit two turnovers in the final minute of regulation, like Minnesota did in Game 2 en route to blowing a five-point advantage in the final 90 seconds. Then there’s Game 1, which the Wolves led by four points with 3 minutes, 37 seconds to play, only to then go scoreless until Reid’s basket with 10 seconds to play. That fatal scoring drought featured four missed shots and three turnovers. And Dallas is doing the complete opposite on the other end of the floor. The Mavericks — who sported the NBA’s fourth-best clutch-time net rating post Christmas, outscoring opponents by 23.8 points per 100 possessions — are routinely carving the Wolves’ top-ranked defense up with the game on the line. ADVERTISEMENT Oftentimes it’s via Luka Doncic sizing up an opponent 1 on 1 before either getting to the mid range to knock down a jumper, or hitting a stepback three-pointer. At other points, he’s catching the Wolves napping, like he did late Sunday, when he saw Edwards’ back turned to the play and made a quick pass that led to a hockey assist on a P.J. Washington triple to put Dallas up 107-104. Minnesota never recovered. “It starts with kind of a mental breakdown on a left-corner 3 from Washington when the game is tied,” Finch said, “and that gives them just enough breathing room.” The Mavericks are outscoring the Wolves by 39.2 points per 100 possessions in the clutch in this series. It’s the difference between the Mavericks being up 3-0 — the current state of the situation — and Minnesota potentially even leading the series. “The whole series, we’ve struggled to close games. These three-minute games that we’re playing, we’re losing,” Finch said. “That’s been the story of the series.” ADVERTISEMENT It’s easy to look at that and think how easily things could be flipped. But the reality is the playoffs reveal who you are — both your strengths and weaknesses. And this has been a major wart for Minnesota all season that was left unresolved, and now has the Wolves on the brink of elimination. “If we were winning these games, you would feel confident when you look up and see four minutes left and you’re winning the game, you’re going to think positive thoughts,” Wolves guard Mike Conley said. “I can’t speak for every person, but I’m sure we’re looking up and saying, ‘How are we going to win this one? How are we going to figure it out?’ “That’s a moment of the game where we have to be tight, together and figure it out. Obviously, (the struggles are) on our minds. For the majority of the series, we were giving ourselves a chance, giving ourselves leads, giving ourselves opportunity. We know what part of the game we need to be better at. The part that’s gonna win us the game is that fourth quarter.” Many basketball games are won in the final five minutes. Or, in the Wolves’ case, lost in the final five minutes.

TORONTO, May 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- \"Today, the Government of Ontario announced the Homeowner Protection Act, 2024 , which includes banning registrations for Notices of Security Interest (NOSIs), implementing a 10-day cooling-off period for purchases of newly built freehold homes, consulting on illegal building and selling, and building more housing near transit. OREA commends Minister of Public and Business Service Delivery, Todd McCarthy, and the Ford Government for this legislation and their efforts to protect vulnerable homeowners from bad actors who unfairly exploit the use of NOSIs. Too many Ontarians, when selling their home, have been surprised by one or more NOSIs – fine print in contracts for water coolers, furnaces, or security systems that include exorbitant buyout charges to be paid before the home can be sold. Banning NOSI registrations will help reduce additional and unnecessary fees being tacked onto the price tag of a home. OREA is also pleased to see that the Ministry will implement a 10-day cooling-off period for purchasers of newly built freehold homes, a protection that is already in place for pre-construction condo sales in Ontario. Extending this protection to newly constructed homes will enhance consumer protection by allowing buyers a 10-day period to review and cancel an agreement without penalty, leveling the playing field between Ontario's hardworking families and well-resourced corporate developers with a team of lawyers. Ontario's REALTORS® commend the province for not extending this policy to resale homes – which OREA has long emphasized would negatively impact both buyers and sellers – as it would undermine certainty in resale transactions, which are typically between private citizens and do not involve corporate developers, and could lead to speculation. In addition, mandating public disclosure of a builder's history of canceled purchase agreements for newly built freehold homes is a welcome policy that will provide consumers with transparency and peace of mind. Together, these improvements will establish a higher standard for honesty, integrity, and professionalism in the homebuilding and buying process. Finally, OREA would like to commend the Ministry for acting on one of our key recommendations outlined in our most recent policy report, Analysis of Ontario's Efforts to Boost Housing Supply – modernizing zoning to support greater density along transit corridors. By exempting specific transit-oriented community lands from immunity provisions in the Planning Act, it will be easier and faster for the province to add ‘missing-middle' homes to Ontario's housing stock and increase overall density in areas that can best support high population levels. The Homeowner Protection Act, 2024 is a significant step towards protecting homeowners from bad actors during the largest financial transaction most Ontarians will make in their lives, and towards building much-needed housing supply across the Province.\" – Tim Hudak, CEO of the Ontario Real Estate Association For more information, please contact: Jean-Adrien Delicano Manager, Media Relations JeanAdrienD@orea.com 416-459-6059 Loading...

        "content": "Vice President Kashim Shettima on Monday unveiled the State Action Plans on Durable Solution to Internal Displacement in the country. While unveiling the plan at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, Mr Shettima called for a global partnership to address the problem of internal displacement in Nigeria. The action plan is a United Nations Secretary General’s Solution Agenda on Internal Displacement. It aims to help internally displaced persons find a durable solution to their displacement, prevent new displacement crises from emerging and ensure those facing displacement receive effective protection and assistance. The programme is being implemented in four northern states of Adamawa, Benue, Borno and Yobe. The Vice-President pledged the Federal Government’s unwavering commitment to ensuring the safety and well-being of displaced citizens. He outlined the strategy adopted by the President Bola Tinubu’s administration in tackling the country’s internal displacement challenge. “For a country that has endured the devastations of economic disadvantages across generations, we cannot afford further expansion in the displacement of our people. ” So, we remain committed to ensuring that each displaced individual returns to a safer environment and is given a lifeline to start afresh. “Let us harness the strength of our partnerships, both local and international, to bring about lasting change.” He welcomed the support of the United States and other global partners, stressing that the task ahead demands a united front that transcends political divides. ” We are here to craft solutions that will outlive us, that will offer future generations a place of hope, a home for all, and a land of opportunity where dreams can be pursued without worry. “The journey is not merely about addressing the symptoms of displacement but also about tackling the root causes,” he stated. Outlining the strategy of the Tinubu administration, Mr Shettima pledged investment in sustainable development, education, and economic opportunities as critical components of a comprehensive solution. “By doing so, we not only address the immediate needs of the displaced but also create a foundation for a more stable and prosperous future.” He called for collaborative efforts transcending borders to bring about lasting change, stating that “the task ahead is immense, but with determination, unity, and a clear vision, we can make a profound difference”. On her part, the UN Deputy Secretary-General, Ms Amina Mohammed, commended the efforts of the state governments in drafting action plans for durable solutions to internal displacement. Speaking virtually through an online conferencing platform, Ms Mohammed, said attaining such solutions “is a priority for Nigeria and for the UN. She noted the global number of internally displaced persons has doubled in 10 years to nearly 76 million globally. “Over four million Nigerians remain in search of solutions to their forced displacement. The state action plans capture the first essential steps towards solutions.” Earlier, the UN Assistant Secretary-General and Special Advisor on Durable Solutions, Robert Piper, commended Nigeria’s commitment to the programme. “Today, despite the warnings and the real challenges, I have the honour to say, on behalf of the Secretary-General, that Nigeria is the first of all our 15 pilot countries to formally launch government plans placing over four million IDPs and Returnees on pathways to solutions.” Piper said the launch of the programme was evidence of the political commitment to addressing the plight of IDPs in the country. ” In many ways, the plans you launch today provide a model of how governments can take responsibility for ending displacement. ” Let me reiterate our commitment on behalf of the United Nations: We will keep supporting on the ground; we will help rally donors and we will chase missing partners. ” We will bring lessons from elsewhere; we will celebrate your successes; we may occasionally bring you unwelcome news sometimes, as friends must; but we will stand behind you. We fail or succeed together.” Also, Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno, said the state government was fully committed to the implementation of the Action Plans on Durable Solutions. He noted that 15 per cent of the state’s annual budget would be dedicated to projects undertaken under the initiative. Mr Zulum recalled the efforts of the state government in the past few years in returning displaced persons to their communities. He assured stakeholders at the meeting that the government’s commitment to the cause of displaced persons remain unwavering. On his part, Governor Hyacinth Alia of Benue State, said the launch of the plans was a beacon of hope and catalyst for the transformation of lives and livelihoods in communities affected by conflict. He commended Vice-President Shettima’s inspirational leadership as well as the commitment of all the development partners involved in the project. He noted that the commitment of Shettima aligns with the vision of the State government to build a society where all residents can live in peace and harmony. In the same vein, Governor Mai Mala Bunu of Yobe, said the state government has executed projects across health, education, social welfare and security. Mr Bunu said that this was towards the bid to ensure that displaced persons in the state return to their communities safely. He reaffirmed the commitment of the state government in the operationalisation of the action plan by allocating five per cent of the state’s annual budget over the next three years. Mr Buni called on development partners involved in the programme not to relent in their efforts toward the success of the initiative. The British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Richard Montgomery, commended the progress witnessed during his recent visit to the North-East and the government’s approach to encouraging more investments. “The progress I witnessed during my visit to the North-East recently deserves commendation. ” Nigeria is the first to prove that government-led intervention is possible. We are proud to be part of the process,” he stated. He also called for the mobilisation of new financing, saying “we need to mobilise additional bilateral and multilateral financing to support these plans. “We should also think carefully about how to mobilize Nigeria’s vibrant private sector, not necessarily as a donor but as the engine for economic growth and job creation.

        "content": "On the May 10, 2017 edition of WWE NXT, Cezar Bononi wrestled Aleister Black, now known as Malakai Black in AEW, with Black going over. After initial hype as the next big NXT star, he was let go in 2020. While speaking on an episode of the Developmentally Speaking podcast, the match saved his career. Here are the highlights (per Fightful) : On the bout: “Yeah, the first match that I had on TV, for sure, with Aleister Black, Malakai. There were so many people saying to me that was not going to make it to TV ever then I had that opportunity. It was a really good opportunity. To be honest, I was going to be fired the next day but I did such a good job in that match that saved my my job.” On whether he knew he would get fired: “Cuts. Just cuts. They had to cut and I understand the business, it’s all good. They just had to cut to get new people and whoever is not getting good results, they cut. That’s how business works. I never thought there was something personal or whatever. Actually, I was not delivering whatever was necessary as well. I totally understand on the business side of that. The good thing is that I got at least one chance to do something, and I did it good.”",

        "content": "The City of Lorain’s annual Memorial Day Parade brought hundreds of people to the downtown district despite windy weather topped with cloudy skies. The parade kicked off at 11 a.m. sharp on Eighth Street and proceeded down Broadway Avenue until reaching Black River Landing, according to Lorain Mayor Jack Bradley. Bradley, who had a number of vehicles decorated with his name, walked in the parade alongside Safety Service Director Rey Carrion and others. Lorain Police cruisers led the parade under the blue and white Broadway sign with a number of its vehicles such as “The Beast,” its SWAT vehicle, and others. Multiple youth of the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps followed the leading police cruisers in their uniforms. Amy Pruitt, a mother of four Lorain High School students, grabbed a spot on the side of Broadway Avenue at 9:30 a.m. eagerly awaiting the parade. “This is one of the first events that all four of my kids are in,” Pruitt said. “I’m proud, excited and intrigued spotting them in the crowd. I’m going to root for them when I see them.” While Pruitt was excited, it was also a bittersweet day for her as the parade was also the last time her four children would be in the parade as they will be graduating. Three of Pruitt’s children were marching with the Lorain High School band while the fourth participated as part of his duties of the Junior ROTC, she said. Shannon Argenti, also of Lorain, was sitting along Broadway Avenue with her 5-year-old stepson Hunter Argenti, who was looking forward to catching and gathering the candy which was thrown out to the crowd by several people, including the Lorain Fire Department. The Argentis were in attendance to watch 15-year-old Malicai Argenti, a member of the Junior ROTC, who was marching with the group, said Argenti. “I’m looking forward to seeing him in the parade,” she said, adding that she was excited to see the parade and share in the overall experience. Several residents in street vehicles were also a part of the parade in addition to the Lorain High School and Clearview High School bands and cheerleaders. Also represented at the parade were the Veteran’s Administration Medical Transportation and Valor Home.",

        "content": "Louisiana Republican Senator John Kennedy was shocked to discover that newspaper chain/media company USA Today quietly eliminated his op-ed in which he criticized transgender athletes. Not only did the Gannett-owned paper chain delete op-ed, they didn’t even tell him they were deleting the article that had already been published by several of the chain’s participating papers days before. The article, published in eight of the Gannett papers, was entitled, “Is transgender inclusion more important than women’s sports?” and excerpts of his piece are still on the Louisianan’s senate website. But while the article is still featured on his senate website, the full article was removed from all the papers. Now, when you click to the link where the article used to appear, readers see a that reads, “Content removed: did not meet editorial standards,” and continues saying, “This content has been removed because it did not meet our editorial standards.” The senator has since told that his article was removed because he didn’t bend his knee to the woke terminology that the paper wanted him to use when speaking about radical transgenderism. slammed the USA Today, telling Fox News, that the “USA TODAY Network apparently does not like the way I express myself.” “They think they are the speech police. Drunk on certainty and virtue, they think they are our moral teacher. This attitude is why so many Americans have lost confidence in the media. The media is not going to win that trust back until they return to neutrality instead of advocacy,” Kennedy claimed. According to his website, he made a series of claims in his article denouncing , each backed up with a link to the source he used to reach his conclusions. “Some activists claim that transgender athletes are different from typical men because they take cross-sex hormones. After two years of cross-sex hormone treatments, however, biological male athletes run 12% faster and pound out 10% more push-ups than women,” Kennedy wrote. also said, “Allowing biological boys to compete as girls will harm women’s sports. Still, many activists believe their feelings and the feelings of transgender athletes are more important.” “Men and women don’t compete for the same reasons. Yet transgender activists want athletic institutions to ignore these obvious physical differences so transgender athletes can feel included, even if it hurts biological girls in the process,” the sen. also said. After the paper published the op-ed early in May, Kennedy said he noticed by May 14 that the links he supplied to the articles on his senate website no longer worked. Kennedy told Fox News that he reached out to one of the affiliated papers that originally published the article and had an email exchange with Misty Castile, the executive editor for the Shreveport Times. At first, Castile claimed that they deleted Kennedy’s article because of a lack of “citations” to support his claims. But in a follow-up email, she backtracked on that claim after Kennedy pointed out that there were half a dozen links to citations to support his claims. In other emails, Castile accused Kennedy of using “loaded language” because he wrote “biological male” and “biological female.” Castile further demanded that he rewrite the article to use the left’s woke terminology and then she would “consider” republishing the article. Kennedy blasted the paper chain, saying, “Most people don’t support allowing biological men to participate in women’s sports because they think that will bastardize sports, skew the results, and hurt women. Other people disagree. Gannett should simply report the two sides and not try to silence the position it disagrees with.” We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.",

The Resilience Lab, intentionally constructed inside a flood zone along one of Norfolk’s busiest commercial corridors and flanked by multiple residential neighborhoods, showcases what the future of sustainable coastal living might look like. Inside and out, visitors will find ways to live sustainably and prepare for rising tides, project coordinators said in a news release.

'Tis the season for lime-flavored treats , sweet cakes, and special ice creams to keep you cool. Summer is upon us and exclusive desserts are returning to Trader Joe's in celebration.

It’s seasonal,\" posted one user on X , the website formerly known as Twitter. Those looking to keep it in the key lime family will be thrilled to find the store is also selling its Key Lime Tea Cookies again.

Trader Joe's wants fans to know there's something out there to satisfy everyone's sweet tooth — even those who are gluten-free. The store's back with its Gluten Free Strawberry Muffins which come in a pack of four for $5.99. Made with a blend of white and brown rice flour, potato starch, and tapioca starch, the muffins are allergen-safe, but those who eat gluten would never know, according to Eat This, Not That.

        "content": "TORONTO, May 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- “Today, the Government of Ontario announced the Homeowner Protection Act, 2024 , which includes banning registrations for Notices of Security Interest (NOSIs), implementing a 10-day cooling-off period for purchases of newly built freehold homes, consulting on illegal building and selling, and building more housing near transit. OREA commends Minister of Public and Business Service Delivery, Todd McCarthy, and the Ford Government for this legislation and their efforts to protect vulnerable homeowners from bad actors who unfairly exploit the use of NOSIs. Too many Ontarians, when selling their home, have been surprised by one or more NOSIs – fine print in contracts for water coolers, furnaces, or security systems that include exorbitant buyout charges to be paid before the home can be sold. Banning NOSI registrations will help reduce additional and unnecessary fees being tacked onto the price tag of a home. OREA is also pleased to see that the Ministry will implement a 10-day cooling-off period for purchasers of newly built freehold homes, a protection that is already in place for pre-construction condo sales in Ontario. Extending this protection to newly constructed homes will enhance consumer protection by allowing buyers a 10-day period to review and cancel an agreement without penalty, leveling the playing field between Ontario’s hardworking families and well-resourced corporate developers with a team of lawyers. Ontario’s REALTORS® commend the province for not extending this policy to resale homes – which OREA has long emphasized would negatively impact both buyers and sellers – as it would undermine certainty in resale transactions, which are typically between private citizens and do not involve corporate developers, and could lead to speculation. In addition, mandating public disclosure of a builder’s history of canceled purchase agreements for newly built freehold homes is a welcome policy that will provide consumers with transparency and peace of mind. Together, these improvements will establish a higher standard for honesty, integrity, and professionalism in the homebuilding and buying process. Finally, OREA would like to commend the Ministry for acting on one of our key recommendations outlined in our most recent policy report, Analysis of Ontario’s Efforts to Boost Housing Supply – modernizing zoning to support greater density along transit corridors. By exempting specific transit-oriented community lands from immunity provisions in the Planning Act, it will be easier and faster for the province to add ‘missing-middle’ homes to Ontario’s housing stock and increase overall density in areas that can best support high population levels. The Homeowner Protection Act, 2024 is a significant step towards protecting homeowners from bad actors during the largest financial transaction most Ontarians will make in their lives, and towards building much-needed housing supply across the Province.” – Tim Hudak, CEO of the Ontario Real Estate Association For more information, please contact: Jean-Adrien Delicano Manager, Media Relations JeanAdrienD@orea.com 416-459-6059",

The midfielder has reached the end of his season-long loan from the Lisbon giants with a Premiership and Scottish Cup winners medal in his pocked - but his deal includes a clause that means a £6million bid would be enough to bring the 22-year-old to Glasgow's east end long-term. However, the Portuguese U21 international appears to have hinted that he will not return to Celtic next season as he sent a message to fans on social media. Taking to his Instagram while sharing snaps of his time at Celtic Park, he wrote: \"Grateful for this season. Thank you very very much for all the support.\" Reports in Portugal suggest that a deal is still being considered by the Hoops. O Jogo claim that the Celtic Park chiefs are \"evaluating\" a permanent move for Bernardo. He has reportedly been told that he is not in the first-team plans for Benfica going into next season.

        "content": "Three southern Albertans will be inducted into the Alberta Business Hall of Fame later this year, including a longtime high-profile oilman, an early adopter of financial technology and a former pro hockey player. The co-founder and CEO of Symend, a Calgary-based tech firm that’s among Canada’s fastest-growing companies, will meanwhile receive the Southern Alberta Young Innovator Award, given each year to a business leader under 40. The annual awards, entering their 20th year running, will be handed out in early November at the Alberta Business Hall of Fame—Southern Alberta Annual Gala Dinner. Susan Anderson, Mike Broadfoot and Brett Wilson are this year’s three inductees. Anderson started her career by co-founding DirectCash Payments Inc., a publicly traded financial services company in 1997 when financial technology — commonly known as fintech — was still a fledgling industry. Over the next two decades it became the second-largest ATM company in the world, grossing more than $400 million in revenue. The company was bought in 2017 by Cardtronics Inc. in a deal valued at about $460 million. Anderson later co-founded Digital Commerce Bank, a private Canadian chartered financial institution, and is currently the company’s board chair. She’s also currently president and CEO of Cannonball Capital Inc., a Calgary-based institutional investor in venture companies, private and public equities and commercial real estate. Anderson also serves on several boards and is on the strategic advisory board of the Hotchkiss Brain Institute at the University of Alberta. Her academic career started at the University of Calgary, where she obtained a commerce degree; she later completed her law degree at the University of Alberta. Broadfoot started his career in business after a hockey career that saw him play for the University of Alberta Golden Bears and later professionally in Switzerland, where he played for one year until moving back to Alberta. Settling in Calgary, he spent five years with Gulf and Petro Can in the oil and gas sector. Over the remaining decades, he’s been a founder or early-stage principal investor and director in sectors including energy, B2B software, medical devices, fintech and property development. Broadfoot has been involved in a number of sales, including Morgan Stanley’s 2019 acquisition of Solium Capital. He’s currently involved with JEMM Properties, a developer focused on densifying Calgary’s urban core, and two tech companies in project management software and fintech. Wilson, meanwhile, comes with the highest public profile of the three, having spent three years as a “dragon” on CBC’s Dragons Den. He got his career started in the early 1990s by co-founding FirstEnergy Capital Corp. with current Calgary Flames owner Murray Edwards, Rick Grafton and Jim Davidson. The company has gone on to become Canada’s leading energy investment bank. It was solid in 2016 to Toronto-based GMP Capital Inc. Outside of the private sector, Wilson has raised money for several causes including prostate cancer and has funded research at the Calgary Counselling Centre into studying the issue of domestic abuse. Among his many public engagements, in February Wilson moderated a conversation between conservative media personality Tucker Carlson and well-known Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson. Finally, was announced as this year’s recipient of the Young Innovator Award for southern Alberta. He is the co-founder and CEO of Symend, which has quickly become one of the top telecommunication and financial services companies in the world by providing behaviour science, data science and technology to its clients. Symend was mentioned in Startup Genome’s cleantech rankings which highlighted Calgary as one of the . Symend recently completed a $151-million fundraising round, adding to the case that fintech is becoming one of the city’s sub-sector strengths. Joshaghani is also a member of the Business Council of Alberta, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce’s AI council and sits on the board at the Alberta Children’s Hospital Foundation. X:",

        "content": "THE summer heat might be something to look forward to, but with the higher temperatures comes some unwanted creepy crawlies sneaking into your home. Spiders can hide in homes and come out during mating season, which is usually from September, but that doesn't mean they're not also around before then. Luckily, one savvy woman has shared a simple trick to get rid of them for good - and you won't have to break the bank of posh traps and gadgets to do it. Anna Louisa took to Instagram to share her top tips, which include mixing together water and 20 drops of peppermint oil . Poured into a spray bottle - you can reuse an old cleaning bottle - the trick will deter spiders from lingering in your home. However, pet owners should note that this method won't be suitable for them, as peppermint oil can be harmful to some animals. Instead, the mum suggested another trick to keep spiders and pther pests at bay. \"Fruit flies dislike the smell of white vinegar so put a small bowl of it near your fruit to keep them away,\" she explained. \"I add a few drops of eucalyptus oil to mask the smell of white vinegar but this isn’t necessary.\" Other cleaning fans loved the idea and couldn't wait to try it out. \"Will be trying these this week. We’ve had them coming in through a gap in the skirting board at the back door and now coming through the front door,\" one commented on the viral clip. A second agreed: \"Yes love this trick, I tried it last year and it worked for me.\" The best part about this trick is if you don't already have vinegar a home, you can pick some up for as little as 35p in shops including Tesco, making the trick a total bargain. And another added: \"Lavender also works with ants too and spiders.\" There's one sure fire way of getting rid of spiders in your home and that is to introduce a pet to your family. In particular cats are the perfect animals to get rid of unwanted spiders, as they chase away unwanted bugs from your home. As well as peppermint, spiders are repelled by the smell of this plant . So you can either grow it as a houseplant, or place some around your bathrooms and wardrobes to help make it a less appealing home for the insects. Plus it make your home smell wonderful, so it’s a win-win. Pest control expert Paul Blackhurst says start with your bins. He told the Express : \"As with most pests, the best way to control spiders is to limit their food source.\" There's a big chance that you will see more spiders situated around the bin in your home. That's because your waste attracts flies - which are food for spiders. To eradicate this issue, one thing that you can do it try moving your bins outside or as far away as possible, while also ensuring that you keep the lids closed whenever you're not using them. Another tip is to keep the bins clear from any doorways and windows that lead into your house. Common pests in the garden don’t need to be a cause for alarm. If you can identify them, you can work on getting rid of them and preventing them from returning. Aphids (Greenfly, Blackfly) Aphids are extremely common and can impact plant growth. They have tiny soft pear-shaped bodies, and are usually green or black. You may spot them clustered on the stem of soft shoots – look under leaves in particular – or may find a sticky substance on your plants that gives away aphids have been there sucking at the sap. Whitefly These small white-winged insects are related to aphids, at just 1 or 2 mm in length, and look very much like white moths as adults. They can be found on the underside of leaves, preferring younger, fresher leaves. They fly in clusters when you disturb them. Their lifecycle is only three weeks long, which means an infestation can occur very rapidly. Slugs An unmissable, squashy-looking body plus small sensory tentacles on its head. Slugs move along on one muscular foot. They range in scale from surprisingly small to terrifyingly large; limax cinereoniger species can grow comfortably beyond 20 cm in length. Cabbage Moth Caterpillar Cabbage moth caterpillars happily make their way into the heart of the vegetables, The caterpillars are distinguished in shades of yellow or browny green with no hair. Mealy Bug Mealybugs are tiny oval-shaped insects that have a white, powdery wax coating. There are several different species, many of which have what looks like legs coming from their sides and back end. In their earliest stage of life, it’s entirely possible to mistake them for fungus and not recognise them as insects at all.",

        "description": "No aspiring molcajete owner should be without our guide to preparing, cooking with and caring for their traditional pestle and mortar.The post Learn how to ‘molcajetear’ like a Mexican appeared first on Mexico News Daily",
        "content": "Molcajetes have been used across Mesoamerica for centuries and are cherished as one of Mexico’s most beloved kitchen tools. A three-legged stone mortar, the molcajete is made of volcanic stone, as is the tejolote, its cylindrical pestle. To “molcajetear” — Mexico has a knack for turning nouns into verbs — means pressing and grinding ingredients against the walls of the molcajete, imparting a unique flavor and texture. Its rough surface is perfect for grinding and crushing a variety of ingredients. Perfect for creating unique flavors and textures, the molcajete is a beloved tool for making salsas, guacamole, dips and marinades. It’s also ideal for grinding spices and herbs, releasing their aromatic oils. Even nuts and seeds can be ground to create flavorful pastes and powders. The molcajete’s rustic charm and efficient grinding capabilities make it a cornerstone of authentic Mexican cooking. Traditional molcajetes have always been made of volcanic stone, which is natural, non-toxic and safe for food processing. Crafting a molcajete involves a centuries-old carving technique. When you buyone made of volcanic stone, you’re supporting artisans’ craftsmanship and livelihoods. Buying an authentic molcajete isn’t just about bragging rights. Nowadays, there are many cement replicas for sale that can deceive buyers. The big reason to avoid cement molcajetes is that they’re not safe for cooking. Cement wears away when ground, releasing toxins and paint into your food. So, how can you tell if the molcajete you’re eyeing is made of volcanic stone or cement? Volcanic stone has pores, since it was once lava cooling off, passing tiny sulfuric bubbles to its surface. Some molcajetes will have a lot of wide pores, while others may have very small orifices. However, all of them have a rugged surface that makes them effective for grinding. A very smooth surface without pores is usually an indicator of a cement piece. A cement molcajete will absorb water and become evenly soaked, while volcanic stone holds water without absorbing it. However, some volcanic stone pieces have too many wide pores and can leak. While this type may still be an authentic piece, it won’t be a good option for salsa making, as the liquid will filter out. The ultimate test is curing the molcajete, as one made of volcanic stone will immediately release sediments as part of the process. Molcajetes need to be cured before you use them, because the natural stone tends to release residues that you don’t want in your food . Curing for kitchen duty is a simple process involving rice, salt and a little elbow grease: There’s nothing quite like a salsa roja molcajeteada — oh yes, Mexico also loves turning nouns into adjectives. Here’s a simple recipe to get you started. Remember, salsas are an art form, not an exact science. Channel your inner maestro when picking the type and amount of ingredients you use. 3 red chilis 3 tomatoes 2 cloves garlic 1 pinch dried oregano 1 pinch salt Fresh cilantro Molcajete can be used as a noun, a verb and an adjective. Why stop there? When you see molcajete as a dish on a menu, they’re offering you another level of deliciousness. A molcajete contains a medley of grilled meats, vegetables, cheese and salsa. This dish, meant to be shared, is served in a big warm molcajete in the center of the table. Everyone dives in with a warm tortilla in hand. It’s a joyful dining experience made special by the beauty of a molcajete overflowing with tasty goodies. Here’s a fun tidbit: I’ve seen people find solace in the act of grinding with a molcajete. Rhythmically grinding stuff with your sheer force can release pent-up energy and emotions. Who knew that whipping up a sassy salsa could be so therapeutic?

Weber County Sheriff’s Office Search and Rescue said the hiker became disoriented amid the bad weather, and couldn’t find his way off the 8,000-foot mountain overlooking North Ogden. The search team was able to determine the hiker’s general area from a cell phone ping, and later a drone honed in on his exact location. Climb, horse and motorcycle crews responded. However, due to wet conditions and temperatures dropping into the evening, the Department of Public Safety’s helicopter was called to lift the man off the mountain. At around 1 a.m. Sunday, the rescue was completed. Officials said that neither the hiker nor the rescuers were hurt.",

While giving Architectural Digest a tour of her abode for the March cover story, Sofia confessed that she depended on her designer Ohara Davies-Gaetano to bring her “homey and comfortable” concept to life while she was going through a difficult time in her life, per Yahoo. “I loved working with Ohara. She kind of saved my life because I was at a little of a crossroads,” Vergara explained. “It was either, ‘I’m going to hate this house or I’m going to love this house. What am I going to do? I don’t want to move in here because I don’t think things are coming out the way I wanted.’” Sofia Vergara’s top America’s Got Talent looks ranked as star turns up heat Sofía Vergara's age wasn't only reason she didn't want baby with Joe Manganiello Sofia purchased the $26 million Los Angeles residence in 2020 when she was still married to her husband at the time, Joe Manganiello. The pair reported their split in July 2023 after seven years of marriage, and Manganiello went on to file for divorce just two days later. Trying to stay positive, Vergara continued with the renovation undertaking for her home and was determined to make the house her own. She was sure to fill it to the brim with some of her favorite things, including her collections of crystal birds and fine china. A lot of thought went into the home. Sofia worked with Davies-Gaetano to curate a collection of antique items from Sweden, Spain, France, and Italy in order to create “a house with history and texture.” The home soon started to look like “a well-lived house,” which is exactly what Sofia hoped for, though the home was on the newer end and just built in the 1990s. Sofia has shared one design element in the living room and family room that always catches her eye. “I love it because they open to the backyard which is my favorite thing about the house,” she says. “Every room opens to the pool and the backyard — even when you’re upstairs in the guest rooms.” DON'T MISS... Sofia Vergara’s top America’s Got Talent looks ranked as star turns up heat Sofía Vergara's age wasn't only reason she didn't want baby with Joe Manganiello Sofia Vergara confirms romance as she goes Instagram official with new man One of Sofia’s most favored parts of the home is her backyard loaded with tropical plants that remind her of her home country Colombia. “When I found this house, it was horrific. It was like a castle in Transylvania,” she explained. “But when I walked outside and saw this garden, I knew this was where I wanted to live. This outdoor area is like an extension of the house. The most special area in the house.” Some more of her favorite areas in her home include her bedroom which makes her feel “comfortable and sexy,” along with her enormous closet which houses clothing items and accessories that are in rainbow order. “This is where I actually really live, in my closet,” she said. “This is where I spend most of my time – this is like a girl’s dream.”",

        "content": "Mrs Tamunominini Makinde, the wife of Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde, on Monday, flagged off the introduction of the HPV vaccine into Oyo State’s immunisation schedule and the commencement of a five-day Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccination campaign to stem cases of cervical cancer in women. Speaking at the flag-off ceremony at Saint Paul’s Anglican Primary School in Basorun, Ibadan, Mrs Makinde, represented by the wife of the State deputy governor, Chief Mrs Ajibola Lawal, stated that the HPV vaccine has been proven to reduce the risk of HPV infection significantly and, subsequently, the development of cervical cancer. According to her, the introduction of the HPV vaccine for girls aged 9 to 14 years marks a significant milestone in addressing cervical cancer in Nigeria and improving the health and well-being of Nigeria’s young girls. She added that the introduction of HPV vaccination into the state’s routine immunisation schedule reiterates the government’s commitment to reducing the burden of cervical cancer in Nigeria and providing girls with a healthier, brighter future. “This initiative promises to safeguard our children’s future and tackle a significant health challenge head-on. “Cervical cancer is a devastating disease that affects women all over the world, and Nigeria is no exception. It is a leading cause of death among women in the nation, and the burden of this disease has weighed heavily on the hearts and minds of our healthcare community, hence the reason it must be viewed with a binocular of public health importance. “Reliable scientific data informed the decision to vaccinate females between the ages of 9 and 14 with the HPV vaccination . At this age, the vaccine is most effective, providing a strong shield against the virus before any potential exposure.” Oyo State Health Commissioner, Dr Oluwaseresimi Ajetunmobi, stated that the HPV vaccine is safe, effective, and does not cause infertility and therefore encouraged parents to ensure their daughters take the vaccine. She declared that over 600,000 children aged 9 to 14 years will be vaccinated during the exercise. Subsequently, it will be part of the routine immunisation programme to be given for children aged 9 years. “We are creating awareness that cervical cancer is real; it’s a preventable disease. But the HPV vaccine is not a cause of infertility; rather, it’s a vaccine that will prevent our girls from having cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus has been in existence since, and we have so many strains. But the ones that we are targeting, particularly the 16 and 18 variants. And that is why it’s important that our girls come out. “Let’s give appropriate information and knowledge concerning this HPV virus and the vaccine. It’s not a vaccine that will cause infertility, but rather, a vaccine that will prevent cervical cancer.” UNICEF’s Health Specialist, Dr Ijeoma Agbo, stated that UNICEF had championed bringing in approximately over 15 million doses of the HPV vaccine to Nigeria because it sees the vaccine as pivotal to making the loss of 8,000 Nigerian women to cervical cancer, something of the past. “This is a practical step in breaking the cycle of preventable disease. And of course, for UNICEF, this is a priority for us. We believe that every child, every girl, needs to have the opportunity to survive, thrive, and lead a productive life,” she declared. In a remark, the Executive Secretary of the Oyo State Primary Health Care Board, Dr. Muideen Olatunji stated that cervical cancer is a public health concern and that girls between the ages of 9 and 14 were eligible for the vaccine, which normally costs between N35,000 and N95,000. “By safeguarding the female gender, we are also safeguarding ourselves, as we men will be shielded from acquiring HPV if the females are HPV-negative. HPV in men can cause other problems, including cancer and genital warts.”",

As the artificial intelligence revolution gains momentum, a bullish analyst foresees a surge in electricity demand, which they said is a boon for solar companies like First Solar Inc FSLR .

The body is feeling better than it did two months ago. \"Maybe in two months I say it's enough. That is something I don't feel yet.\" Nadal not return for the 2025 French Open but he still plans to play the at Roland Garros in . Nadal, an singles medallist in in 2008 and doubles champion at the Rio Games, later told reporters: \"That's my main goal now. \"I need to prepare myself the proper way to to arrive healthy and well-prepared.\" He won't make the rankings cut for the , but as a Grand Slam winner he would be eligible for a spot reserved for major winners. Plagued by injuries, which had limited him to just four events since last year, former number one Nadal is now 275 in the rankings and was unseeded in . \"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect. You know, I wake up one day and I found a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,\" said Nadal of his recent battles with a hip injury. In his career, he has had to skip 11 Grand Slams. That is certain to become 12 next month when he is likely to skip where he was champion in 2008 and 2010. \"It looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the again on clay,\" he said. \"I don't think it's going to be smart after the things that happened to my body now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay. I don't think it's a positive idea right now.\"",

        "content": "Manchester United and Arsenal are set to go head-to-head to sign French wonderkid Desire Doue. The young midfielder has emerged as one of the most exciting talents in Ligue 1 over the past season-and-a-half with Rennes. His form has caught the eye of a host of clubs in the Premier League , who could formalise their interest this summer. According to Mail Online , United and Arsenal have both submitted enquiries regarding his services. Tottenham are also noted to be among those tracking him. Interest is not just limited to the Premier League. European clubs such as Paris St Germain, Bayern Munich , Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Dortmund are all tracking Doue. Transfer news live - Chelsea in 'advanced' Maresca talks, Man Utd deal confirmed Anthony Martial confirms Man Utd exit after nine years with emotional message The 18-year-old has just two years left on his contract with Rennes. The French side are open to a sale but only in the region of around £35m with significant add-ons. Rennes boss Julien Stephan spoke out on the youngster’s future at the weekend and admitted an exit is possible. He said: “We know today’s market, notably for the very young players. He will decide through his personal ambition. I’m not naive. “We’re glad to have developed him during the second part of the season. He’s at risk of leaving without a single full season here, that’s a shame. I would have liked that; that would have been an ideal situation.” Desire Doue is being eyed by a clutch of clubs in the Premier League and Europe ( Image: Getty Images) Who should Man United sign this summer? Share your suggestions in the comments below Doue has made 76 appearances for Rennes since breaking into the team. He has scored eight goals and provided seven assists. Some of his teammates are huge fans and have even claimed that he is the ‘best they have seen’. While Arsenal and United are vying for his services this season, it is not the first time that Doue has been at the heart of speculation. Newcastle were interested in him last summer as confirmed by his agent Mikael Silvestre. Speaking to The i last year, the former Premier League star said: “I know Newcastle came to watch him and were in touch with us. “Like a lot of clubs in Europe when they scout, they come and try and speak to the entourage and get a feeling and try to understand what the situation is. It’s not necessarily about the contractual situation but also what’s going on in the life of the player as much as possible before they make a move.” While United are linked with a swoop for Doue, they have already lost the services of one of his countrymen. Striker Anthony Martial has confirmed he will leave the club for nothing at the end of his contract. Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

        "content": "PERTH, Australia — In an industry first, Rio Tinto and BHP will collaborate on the testing of large battery-electric haul truck technology in the Pilbara, Western Australia, to accelerate the potential for its future deployment. The two companies will work with manufacturers Caterpillar and Komatsu to conduct independent trials of their battery-electric haul trucks, including testing of battery, static and dynamic charging systems, to assess performance and productivity in the Pilbara environment. The collaboration reflects the individual commitments made from BHP, Rio Tinto, Komatsu and Caterpillar to support Rio Tinto and BHP’s shared ambition of net zero operational greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. As part of the collaboration, two Cat 793 haul trucks will be trialled from the second half of 2024, and two Komatsu 930 haul trucks tested from 2026 at mine sites in Western Australia’s Pilbara region. Caterpillar and Komatsu will each provide one truck each to both BHP and Rio Tinto for these trials. BHP will trial the Caterpillar trucks, while Rio Tinto will trial the Komatsu trucks. Outcomes of the trials will be shared between BHP and Rio Tinto. These trials represent the first stage of battery-electric haul truck testing at BHP and Rio Tinto’s Pilbara operations. Ongoing testing, development and refinement of truck and battery design is anticipated with each manufacturer. This will inform the approach for testing a larger number of haul trucks and the potential deployment of battery-electric haul truck fleets into each company’s operations. Rio Tinto Iron Ore Chief Executive Simon Trott said: “This collaboration brings together two leading global miners with two of the world’s biggest manufacturers of haul trucks to work on solving the critical challenge of zero-emissions haulage. “There is no clear path to net zero without zero-emissions haulage, so it’s important that we work together to get there as quickly and efficiently as we can. Testing two types of battery-electric haul trucks in Pilbara conditions will provide better data, and by combining our efforts with BHP we will accelerate learning. “As we work to repower our Pilbara operations with renewable energy, collaborations like this move us closer to solving the shared challenge of decarbonising our operations, and meeting our net zero commitments.” BHP President Australia Geraldine Slattery said: “Operational decarbonisation relies on breakthroughs in technology and partnerships like this will help drive our industry forward. We are thrilled to work with Rio Tinto, Caterpillar and Komatsu on these trials. “Replacing diesel as a fuel source requires us to develop a whole new operational ecosystem to surround the fleet. We need to address the way we plan our mines, operate our haulage networks, and consider the additional safety and operational considerations that these changes will bring. This is why trials are so critical to our success as we seek to test and learn how these new technologies will work in practice and integrate into our mines. “We’ve already seen a step-change reduction in Scope 1 and 2 operational greenhouse gas emissions through switching some of our supply to renewable electricity, and we are looking to build on that progress through development of battery-electric technology to reduce diesel usage across our operations.” Note to editors In 2021, Rio Tinto and BHP worked with both Caterpillar and Komatsu to support the development and validation of their prototype battery-electric haul trucks. The trucks included in these trials are based on these prototypes. Carbon emissions from diesel consumption in our mining equipment and rail fleet accounted for 12% of Rio Tinto’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2023. Carbon emissions from the combustion of diesel accounted for around 40% of BHP’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions in FY2020. Press release from Rio Tinto .

        "content": "Even after a six-win 2023 season, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the New York Giants. Here are three reasons they’ll bounce back in 2024. 1. Daniel Jones is not as bad as you think Jones may have won just two of six games before tearing his ACL last year but played well enough in 2022 to earn a four-year, $160M contract in 2023. In his first (and only) full season playing in Brian Daboll’s offense, Jones finished as the NFL’s 15th-leading passer with 3,205 yards. While that's hardly a Hall of Fame stat line, he added seven scores and 708 yards rushing that year. By comparison, Bills quarterback Josh Allen finished 2018 as the NFL’s 32nd-leading passer with 2,074 yards and 12 interceptions in his first season with Daboll as coordinator. If Jones and his coach can get back to what worked in 2022 and work out the bugs from 2023, there’s no reason to think they can’t succeed in 2024. 2. Malik Nabers is as good as you think Nabers ranked second in the FBS with 1,569 receiving yards and tied for third with 14 touchdowns in 2023. He helped LSU quarterback Jayden Daniels win a Heisman and could be the team's best wide receiver since Odell Beckham Jr. Malik Nabers recorded four receptions of 25+ yards in the first half against Mississippi State, the most for an LSU player in the opening half of a game since Ja'Marr Chase in 2019 vs Vanderbilt. pic.twitter.com/1H7AezsNOr At six feet tall and 200 pounds, Nabers can play all three receiver spots and may have to given the team’s lack of playmakers. NFL Network’s Lance Zierlein compares him favorably to the Vikings’ Justin Jefferson, and Pro Football Focus ranked Nabers as the best wide receiver in the 2024 NFL Draft. 3. Tyrone Tracy Jr. could be a weapon As a former wide receiver, Tracy should see the field immediately as a third-down back and possibly more as the season goes on. He played 38 games at wide receiver for Iowa before transferring to Purdue in 2022 and switching to running back in 2023. Tracy led the Big Ten in yards per carry (6.3) last season by forcing 46 missed tackles on just 114 carries. He also had eight touchdowns. Taken in the fifth round, Tracy could be the steal of this year’s draft and a valuable piece of the offense moving forward.",

        "description": "The airline entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this year and has a five-year restructuring plan.",
        "content": "GOL Linhas Aéreas of Brazil is working on its exit from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process and earlier today announced a five-year recovery plan. is a low-cost carrier in Brazil that operates a fleet of Boeing 737 aircraft, one of several airlines worldwide to do so. It is the second Brazilian airline to enter the Chapter 11 Bankruptcy process in recent years and hopes to exit soon. According to a report today from , the airline will receive more than $1 billion in capital injections. Earlier today, GOL revealed its 5-Year Financial Plan to restructure and put the airline back on its feet. The plan outlines that by 2026, GOL hopes to return to its pre-pandemic capacity. Additionally, the airline aims to expand its network domestically and internationally, something that already happened last week through the announcement of a codeshare with Azul Linhas Aéreas on some routes. By 2029, GOL expects to have 169 planes in its fleet, a net increase of 31 aircraft based on the current fleet. In the coming years, many aircraft will be retired, and GOL will modernize its fleet. The airline's order book currently has 88 planes, 63 Boeing 737 MAX 8s and 25 Boeing 737 MAX 10s (which have not been certified). A significant portion of GOL's five-year plan is to inject $1.5 billion in capital by issuing new shares and refinancing nearly $2 billion of its debt. After the new plan was announced, shares in Brazil dropped up to 3.5%, and GOL said there was a significant chance its shares would hit \"minimal value upon emergence\" from bankruptcy. \"We are pleased to reach another important milestone in our financial restructuring process. Since the beginning of this process, GOL has continued to operate without interruptions, demonstrating solidity in executing our commercial strategy and cost management. We have successfully renegotiated agreements with our lessors for most of our aircraft and are investing in our engines and expanding our operational fleet.\" - Celso Ferrer, Chief Executive Officer, GOL Linhas Aéreas Last week, GOL and Azul Linhas Aéreas took a step that fed rumors of a merger. The airlines announced a codeshare agreement to expand their domestic networks. Their respective codes will only be placed on routes operated by one of the airlines. According to Azul's president, Abhi Shah, this creates more than 2,700 one-stop connection opportunities. Brazil only has three major players in the domestic market: GOL, Azul, and LATAM Brasil (formerly TAM). Between GOL and Azul, the two have 52% of seats available in May. Two big airlines joining forces in Brazil is not standard and feeds the rumors that Azul is trying to purchase GOL and merge the two airlines. Though neither airline has openly discussed the merger, Azul's CEO, John Rodgerson, has been straightforward about the airline's interest in consolidating the Brazilian market. When LATAM went through its Chapter 11 process, there were plenty of rumors that it would merge with Azul.",

        "description": "Polk certainly has some lofty goals.",
        "content": "Before the New England Patriots made Ja’Lynn Polk a second-round pick during the 2024 NFL Draft, the Washington Huskies wide receiver returned to Lufkin High School in Lufkin, Texas, to speak with current student-athletes about the next step of his playing career. \"He told the kids, 'Mark it down, I will win a Super Bowl and I will be All-Pro,'\" Lufkin football head coach Todd Quick said about Polk's visit while speaking with Keagan Stiefel of NESN. \"His goals are lofty, but they’re goals he can reach.\" New England selected quarterback Drake Maye with the third overall pick and later grabbed receiver Javon Baker in the fourth round. Over the weekend, Mike Reiss of ESPN noted how former Patriots receiver and Super Bowl XXXIX Most Valuable Player Deion Branch explained how \"it's super valuable\" for New England to have Polk, Maye and Baker develop together from springtime workouts through at least the first few seasons of their pro careers. While Polk built his reputation with Washington, he previously featured for the Texas Tech Red Raiders and played under wide receivers coach Joel Filani. During a chat with Stiefel, Filani compared Polk to two of the NFL's best players at the position. \"He’s just so strong and can control his body,\" Filani said about Polk. \"He can separate enough to where he can make contested catches but give the quarterback an opportunity to get him the ball. I know he wants to be a No. 1. He’s working toward that, and there’s only so many Justin Jeffersons and Ja’Marr Chases, but you talk about a guy like Stefon Diggs — these guys are unwilling to not be the top guy. I see him competing for the top spot, and I think he’ll attack that and take it.\" The Patriots currently lack a proven No. 1 receiver and seemingly aren't in a hurry to trade for a big-name target ahead of training camp. It's unclear if Maye or veteran Jacoby Brissett will begin the upcoming season as New England's QB1, but Polk should receive plenty of opportunities to build chemistry with both signal-callers over the next several months.",

        "content": "SEVERAL 99 Cents Stores have been saved from bankruptcy thanks to rival discount retailer Ollie's. Ollie's announced on May 24 it will acquire 11 former 99 Cents Only Stores, saving them from shuttering forever. On April 4, 99 Cents Only announced it would shut down all its stores. The discount chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy less than one week later. At the time, the chain had 371 locations across California , Arizona , Nevada , and Texas . 99 Cents Only Stores owed its top 10 creditors almost $35 million , according to court documents. The bankrupt chain was given a new lease on life thanks to Ollie's, the largest US retailer of closeout merchandise and excess inventory. Ollie’s said the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware approved its $14.6 million bid for the 99 Cents Stores, per Retail Dive . All 11 of the acquired stores are in “key markets” in Texas, according to Ollie's. Three are owned properties and eight are leased . The store acquisitions are expected to close early next month. “We are very excited to be announced as the winning bidder of these store locations,” said Ollie’s CEO John Swygert. “These stores are the right size, located in good trade areas, have attractive rents and leasing structures, and have been serving value-oriented customers for many years. \"Texas is a great market for us that has tremendous growth potential and continues to benefit from strong population growth.” Ollie’s runs 516 stores across 30 states but is looking to grow its store footprint. The retailer shared in a March earnings call that it has room to expand to 1,300 locations, which is up from a previous goal of 1,050. Acquiring the 99 Cents Only Stores is one step on Ollie's path to a larger store footprint. Ollie's Bargain Outlet is a US chain of discount closeout retailers. It was founded in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania in 1982 by Morton Bernstein and Mark Butler. There are currently 30 states with Ollie's locations: “We are maintaining our target of 50 new stores, less two planned closures, for fiscal 2024 and are in the early stages of evaluating the impact on our new store opening cadence this year,” said Swygert. Regarding the new Texas locations, Ollie's plans a quick turnaround. “We are focused on getting these stores up and running as quickly as possible, given the occupancy expenses we will begin incurring at closing,” said the CEO. In other store closure news, Red Lobster closed 17 restaurants in a single state as the bankruptcy bloodbath continues to sweep the US. Plus, a beloved supermarket is closing in days creating a \"food desert\" - shoppers have three options to get their groceries.",

        "content": "Rick Brant has reason to be excited about next year’s National Aboriginal Hockey Championships (NAHC). Brant is the CEO of the Indigenous Sport, Physical Activity & Recreation Council (I-SPARC), the governing body for Indigenous athletics and recreation in British Columbia. I-SPARC oversees the selection of B.C. squads for the annual NAHC, which features elite Indigenous players from across the country, primarily ages 13 to 17. Earlier this month it was announced that Tk̓emlúps te Secwépemc (formerly the Kamloops Indian Band) will co-host the 2025 NAHC. “It deepens the shared experience for all involved when an Indigenous community hosts such a prestigious Indigenous sporting event,” Brant said. “So, we are thrilled for Tk̓emlúps te Secwépemc to be partnering with the city of Kamloops to deliver the 2025 National Aboriginal Hockey Championships.” The NAHC has been held annually since 2002. The tournament, however, was cancelled in both 2020 and 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2025 event will mark the third time it has been staged in British Columbia. The tourney was first held in the province in 2004 in Prince George. And then the 2017 event was held in the Cowichan Valley district in the province. “It will be a special experience for our teams to compete for a national title in front of a home crowd,” Brant said. Based on recent history, there’s a good chance both the British Columbia female and male squads could capture some hardware at the 2025 tournament. Both B.C. entrants ended up winning the bronze medal in their categories at this year’s NAHC, which concluded earlier this month in Grande Prairie, Alta. The B.C. male program has enjoyed tremendous success in recent times at the national tournament. During the last 10 times the event it has been held, the B.C. male squad has won a medal every single tourney. That medal haul includes three golds, one silver and six bronze. Besides this year, the B.C. female team also won the bronze at the 2022 tourney, which was held in the Nova Scotia community of Membertou. The dates for the 2025 tournament have been set for May 5 to May 10. All matches will be staged at the McArthur Island Sport and Event Centre in Kamloops. Joshua Gottfriedson, the acting chief of Tk̓emlúps te Secwépemc, was pleased to hear the news of where the national tourney will be held next year. “We are honored to welcome elite Indigenous hockey players from across Canada to our city,” he said. “This event not only showcases exceptional talent but also celebrates cultural unity and pride.” Kamloops’ deputy mayor Bill Sarai said his city it excited to host next year’s event. “This tournament highlights our relationship with Tk̓emlúps te Secwépemc, whose unceded ancestral lands we occupy, alongside our dedicated community partners and volunteers,” he said. “Welcoming Indigenous athletes, coaches, and families from diverse communities, we aim to amplify Indigenous voices and the beauty of the local Secwépemc culture and the culture of every athlete at the games.” Lana Popham, B.C.’s minister of Tourism, Arts, Culture and Sport, also welcomed the news of the 2025 NAHC. “These championships are a great opportunity to bring benefits to the region by attracting visitors, fostering job creation and boosting revenue for local businesses,” she said. “I also commend the celebration of Indigenous culture as a prominent feature of these games. Truth and reconciliation is at the heart of our government’s work and a priority in BC’s sport sector.” It remains to be seen how many squads will participate at the 2025 NAHC. The tournament traditionally features provincial, territorial or regional representatives. The 2024 event in Grande Prairie featured 14 competing teams, seven female and seven male. Ontario clubs ended up winning the gold medal in both categories. Besides B.C., other squads that competed in both divisions, were from Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Team Atlantic and Team Eastern Door and the North (Quebec). Since 2017 the two champs of the NAHC are presented with the Turtle Island Cup, which was created by Carey Newman, a First Nations artist from Vancouver Island. Windspeaker.com",

        "content": "A new report from BC Ferries’ public engagement activities has found that the corporation has had mixed results in strengthening its public engagement process. The report , recently presented to the British Columbia Ferries Commissioner focused on the year that ended on March 31, 2024. Progress has been made in Indigenous relations, according to the report, while engagement with ferry-dependent communities has deteriorated, the commissioner noted. In September 2023, BC Ferries announced it was moving community meetings from in-person to online due to rising aggressive, threatening and abusive behaviour. On Sept. 20, during a meeting Diana Mumford was chairing for the Southern Sunshine Coast Ferry Advisory Committee, a member of the public uttered a threat to the effect that if BC Ferries didn’t make changes the individual would “take a gun to everyone” according to BC Ferries. Story continues below advertisement “It’s unfortunate, because ... I think it shows the level of frustration of our community,” Mumford told Global News at the time. 0:58 BC Ferries expanding pet area on some vessels According to the report to the commissioner, BC Ferries intends to return to in-person meetings for spring and summer. Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens. “The Commissioners have heard from the FAC (Ferry Advisory Committee) chairs that there were high levels of frustration among FAC members due to the lack of communication from the Corporation following the cessation of in-person meetings in September,” the report states. “In addition, FAC members felt that they were not consulted nor were they involved in the development of new security measures in their communities.” For the following fiscal year, the commissioner is “strongly recommending” BC Ferries outline the steps it will take to make customers ” feel respected, heard and valued” and that those steps be developed in consultation with communities, FACs, First Nations and other stakeholders. Story continues below advertisement In addition, BC Ferries should demonstrate to the B.C. Ferries Commissioner how it intends to monitor whether the steps taken lead to an enhanced public engagement process, to clearly define and communicate what role the FACs will have in the enhanced public engagement plan and ensure that all communication is shared online in a comprehensive and timely manner.

        "description": "The dog stepped in when the owner couldn't move after he fell and obstructed his breathing.",
        "content": "A day after a dog was adopted from a New Mexico animal shelter, the employees received an unexpected call from the person who adopted the canine. Instead of potentially bad news shelters often get about adopters changing their minds about the pet they brought home, Andrew Budek-Schmeisser wanted to share nothing but praise for the dog who saved his life. Budek-Schmeisser adopted Peanut on March 9 from the Animal Welfare Department after a friend suggested getting a dog tall enough for him to lean on. He has a service dog, but a larger, more sturdy dog would help him as he has difficulty walking. He told that he has a number of illnesses, including cancer and heart problems, and his walking is shaky. The next day after bringing Peanut home, Budek-Schmeisser was outside getting to know the Great Dane and pit mix when he fell and hit his head, obstructing his airway. Peanut immediately stepped in to help. \"I couldn't do anything about it, but Peanut could,\" he said. \"Peanut cleared my airway, and when I was breathing well enough again, he sat me up. He and another dog helped move me to a chair where I could recover.\" Budek-Schmeisser assumes that Peanut and his service dog, Belle, communicated with each other during the incident. Belle is a wolf hybrid, so she doesn't have the strength and height Peanut possesses, he explained. Peanut cleared his airway and got him into a position to breathe again. Then, the two dogs helped move him to a chair. Peanut sat with him, his head against Budek-Schmeisser's chest, making sure he was still breathing and not going to fall again. \"I would not have expected a dog to understand within 24 hours what to do or to have the initiative to do what was necessary,\" he said. \"When I realized what he was doing, I had to put my life and future into his hands, I had to trust him.\" Between that incident and learning the ropes from Belle, Peanut stays by his side constantly. Peanut forgoes what he wants to do, which is chasing lizards, and instead always focuses on keeping Budek-Schmeisser safe. Budek-Schmeisser's biggest takeaway from this incredible moment was not that his life was saved. Instead, Budek-Schmeisser reflected on the fact Peanut waited in a crowded for five months, and instead of giving up, the shelter kept him and saw he could make a difference in someone's life. \"Many dogs and cats waiting out there in shelters that can make a difference in people's lives. All they need is an opportunity,\" he said. \"Healing may come on four paws.\" The shelter was touched to hear about the incredible rescue, which further proves that adopting animals is a win-win for everyone involved. \"A faithful companion is gained, a friendship is formed and a life is saved,\" marketing manager Desiree Cawley told . \"In this circumstance, they both saved each other.\" The Animal Welfare Department currently houses over 700 pets patiently waiting for their forever homes. Cawley said the adoption fee is waived for all pets at the city shelters, including spay or neuter, microchip, I.D. tag, and vaccinations. According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, 6.3 million pets enter U.S. shelters each year, an average of 17,260 a day. The number of dogs and cats taken in by pet shelters hit 46,807 during January 2023, an increase of 1,744 compared with January 2022, the 24Pet Shelter Watch Report found. Around 920,000 surrendered animals are euthanized every year. Shelters are striving to minimize euthanasia rates by promoting adoption campaigns, spaying and neutering programs, and behavior rehabilitation.

        "content": "A theater in Beverly, Massachusetts, is apologizing to patrons who attended a screening of “Jaws” over the weekend, after star Richard Dreyfuss allegedly made comments many patrons considered to be sexist and homophobic. The Cabot Theater hosted “An Evening With Richard Dreyfuss + Jaws Screening,” where attendees were likely fans of the Steven Spielberg classic, hoping for anecdotes about the film. However, Dreyfuss, 76, reportedly went on a rogue rant that ranged from talking about Barbra Streisand, to his opinions on transgender youth and gender affirmation, as well as the Academy Awards’ inclusivity rules. Attendees took to social media to express their disappointment. “We walked out of his interview tonight along with hundred of others because of his racist homophobic mysogynistic rant,” one person commented on The Cabot’s recent Facebook post . “Richard Dreyfuss is an embarrassment to society. I walked out tonight because of his small minded bigoted view of women and choice,” another wrote. One commenter shared that the audience thought the event would be “a light, fun evening listening to stories and anecdotes about RD’s time on the Vineyard making Jaws.” They wrote, “This was disgusting. How could the Cabot not have vetted his act better. Apparently (I found out too late), he has a reputation for spewing this kind of racist, homophobic, misogynistic bullcrap...We did NOT get what we paid for.” The venue sent out an apology email to attendees and expressed their regret in a statement obtained by The Hollywood Reporter . “We are aware of, and share serious concerns, following the recent event with Richard Dreyfuss prior to a screening of the film ‘Jaws’ at The Cabot. The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold as an organization. We deeply regret the distress that this has caused to many of our patrons,” a representative wrote. “We regret that an event that was meant to be a conversation to celebrate an iconic movie instead became a platform for political views. We take full responsibility for the oversight in not anticipating the direction of the conversation and for the discomfort it caused to many patrons.” “We are in active dialogue with our patrons about their experience and are committed to learning from this event how to better enact our mission of entertaining, educating and inspiring our community.” The Post has reached out to representatives for Dreyfuss for comment.",

        "description": "Cole Irvin threw five scoreless innings and Cedric Mullins and Kyle Stowers each had two-RBI hits in the Orioles' five-run fourth inning.",
        "content": "Cedric Mullins sprinted hard out of the box and turned on the jets just before hitting second base. He dove headfirst into third, letting out a scream before smacking his hands together. If not for the cheers from the announced 40,951 fans at Camden Yards, it appeared that Mullins expressed the emotion out of frustration. Perhaps he did. The center fielder has been engrossed in a brutal slump — a .148 batting average in May entering Monday’s Memorial Day matinee against the Boston Red Sox — and he let out his anger with a two-run triple in the fourth inning and his celebration while kneeling on third base. Mullins’ extra-base hit was one of seven the Orioles smacked en route to an 11-3 rout of the Red Sox for Baltimore’s fifth straight win after sweeping the White Sox in Chicago over the weekend. Before Mullins’ triple broke the game open in the Orioles’ five-run fourth, Kyle Stowers hit an opposite-field double to drive home two. It was the first of three hits Stowers would tally to mark the best game of his young career. Stowers debuted with the Orioles in 2022 and made the club’s opening day roster last year, but he was later sent to the minors and his 2023 campaign was marred by a shoulder injury and a fractured nose from a hit by pitch. The 26-year-old outfielder waited patiently this spring at Triple-A Norfolk and rejoined the Orioles earlier this month. His three hits Monday tie his career-high set in September 2022 — also versus the Red Sox — while his four RBIs are the most he’s tallied across the first 57 games of his career. Mullins, Stowers and the rest of Baltimore’s bats backed Cole Irvin to earn the left-hander his fifth win of the season, tying him with Grayson Rodriguez for the team lead. Irvin pitched five scoreless innings to prove once again he’s one of the Orioles’ best starting pitchers. It was the southpaw’s first start back in the rotation after he was temporarily sent to the bullpen. He has a 2.84 ERA this season and has allowed only two runs in his past 31 1/3 innings as a starting pitcher. Jordan Westburg, Adley Rutschman, Jorge Mateo and Ryan Mountcastle also clobbered extra-base hits and drove in runs for the Orioles, who scored one in the second and third before the fourth-inning outburst and four more in the seventh. The 11 runs are tied for the second most Baltimore has scored this season. The Orioles’ bullpen was sharp behind Irvin except for newcomer Thyago Vieira , who walked three batters and allowed a bases-clearing triple to Romy Gonzalez for Boston’s lone offense of the afternoon. The eight-run victory in the series opener is the largest margin the Orioles have won by since May 5 against the Cincinnati Reds. Baltimore is 34-18 and 1 1/2 games behind the American League East-leading New York Yankees, who did not play Monday. The Orioles are 4-0 against the Red Sox (27-27) and 8-2 versus AL East foes. If they win Tuesday or Wednesday, it will mark the 18th straight divisional series the Orioles haven’t lost, a streak that dates to April 2023. This story will be updated.

And that is something we are not aiming for,” government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said in Berlin. He also referred to statements made by German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. There have been calls from some recently for NATO powers to bolster Ukrainian air defences by establishing some sort of protective shield over Ukraine. Hebestreit did not want to comment specifically on a question as to whether and in what form Ukraine had given assurances that it would not carry out attacks on targets in Russia with the weapons systems supplied by Germany. These regulations were subject to confidentiality and had proved their worth, Hebestreit said. He also noted that international law stipulates that a state under attack can also defend itself outside its borders.",

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors preparing for a market contraction should consider these three companies among cloud computing stocks to sell.The post 3 Sorry Cloud Computing Stocks to Sell in May While You Still Can appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Though the cloud computing sector has seen generous growth over the last five years, some analysts have wondered if the market is overvalued. However, there is no simple answer to this question, as the concept of cloud computing can refer to any number of companies that provide an offsite technical solution for customers. With the industry’s potential projected to grow to $2.3 trillion by 2032, it’s important to know which cloud computing stocks to sell and which to buy. Currently, some business analysts believe the future of cloud computing is industry-specific, meaning that the companies with lucrative niches are likely to go the furthest. It also means that companies with less adaptable and relevant business models over time are likely to suffer long-term. Thus, the three stocks mentioned in this article might have upsides in the short term but are likely to remain stable as the cloud service industry progresses. Workiva (WK) When looking at the big picture regarding Workiva (NYSE: WK ) the stock is up 56% over the last five years. This is despite its lack of profitability over the same time frame and reality might finally be catching up to it. The company’s cloud-based software is essentially a one-stop shop for financial reporting, audit preparation and risk management and has been the focal point of the hype around Workiva. There are two ways of looking at the company’s current trajectory. First, the company could be undergoing a period of price correction, as many of the cloud-based and computing-centric companies are now under the microscope due to whispers of an artificial intelligence bubble. Second, the company could be overvalued and in a generous downturn as it continually struggles to generate income . Though its software-as-a-service model can be lucrative over time, its original investors could lose patience soon. Thus, it might be best to start considering Workvia as one of the cloud computing stocks to sell. Zoom Video Communications (ZM) For a brief moment during the remote-work paradigm of the COVID-19 pandemic, it seemed like Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM ) was the future of productivity. After all, between 2020 and 2021 , nearly everyone’s remote working experience involved the company’s video call application. Yet, the reality of market saturation might be setting in for ZM stock as the company faces a stagnating market for video call software. Beyond the market slowdown, Zoom now faces major competition from established industry giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO ) with their respective Teams and Webex software. Thus, the company’s stock could be approaching another selloff wave as investors recognize its uncompetitive position. Moreover, if you were one of the investors who had initially invested in the stock during its peak run in 2020, there’s likely no chance of seeing performance like that again . These days, Zoom is a shell of its former self simply because it faces competitors who can price video call products more competitively due to diversification. Zscaler (ZS) This last pick is somewhat mercurial in terms of potential, as it relies on a very specific subset of business to prosper amidst a period of tumultuous growth. As a cloud cyber-security company, Zscaler (NASDAQ: ZS ) could have a long runway ahead of it or a slow decay. Currently, the stock commands strong buy ratings from several analysts. However, its overvaluation looms. This is based on factors such as repeated quarterly losses amidst an increasingly competitive market with competitors like Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ) and Palo Alto (NASDAQ: PANW ). Moreover, Baird recently adjusted its price target from $265 to $260 . While not an excessive decrease and still representing an outperformance rating, it does signal caution ahead of Zscaler’s next earnings report. Thus, the best time to sell could be after its Q3 earnings report, should investor optimism continue to drive the stock up before a correction cycle. On the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "DALLAS — Nicholas Kirton scored 51 runs and Ravinderpal Singh added 41 to help Canada defeat Nepal by 63 runs in a warm-up match Monday ahead of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup. Kirton slammed four fours and two sixes in his 39-ball innings. Opener Navneet Dhaliwal contributed 32 runs. Nepal, ranked 17th among T20 teams compared to No. 23 for Canada, won the toss and elected to field at the Grande Prairie Cricket Stadium. Canada finished at 183 for seven in its 20 overs and then dismissed Nepal for 120 with three balls remaining. Dillon Heyliger led the Canadian bowling attack with four wickets while Jeremy Gordon and captain Saad Bin Zafar each took two. Nepal was at 57 for one at one point, before batsmen starting falling in quick succession. The Canadians will open play at the same Texas venue Saturday, facing the co-host U.S. in the opener of the tournament that runs through June 29 in the U.S. and West Indies. Earlier this year, Canada lost a three-match one-day international series 3-0 to Nepal before defeating Nepal A 2-1 in another three-game series. Canada is scheduled to face the 15th-ranked Netherlands in a final warm-up Thursday, also in Dallas. The Canadians have been drawn in Group A with No. 1 India, No. 7 Pakistan, No. 11 Ireland and the 19th-ranked U.S. After the Americans, Canada will meet Ireland on June 7 and Pakistan on June 11, with both games in suburban New York, before wrapping up Group A play against India on June 15 in Lauderhill, Fla. The top two teams in each group move on to the Super Eights, to be played in Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The two top teams from each pool in the Super Eight then move on to the semifinals in Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago on June 26 and 27, respectively. The final will be held June 29 at the Kensington Oval in Barbados. First-round matches in the U.S. will be split between Nassau County International Cricket Stadium (New York), Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium (Dallas) and Broward County Stadium (Lauderhill). West Indies, which hosted the event in 2010, will hold matches at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium (Antigua and Barbuda), Kensington Oval (Barbados), Guyana National Stadium (Guyana), Daren Sammy Cricket Ground (Saint Lucia), Arnos Vale (Saint Vincent and The Grenadines) and Brian Lara Cricket Academy (Trinidad and Tobago). The Canadians qualified for their first T20 World Cup in October, defeating Bermuda by 39 runs to win the four-team ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Americas Region Final. Canada and Bermuda both finished with 4-1-0 records with one no-result. But Canada, which lost to Bermuda by 86 runs in its opening match, won the tournament by a superior net run rate (3.98 to 2.41). The Canadians failed to qualify for the eight previous editions of the T20 World Cup, which has expanded to 20 teams in 2024. — This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024 The Canadian Press",

        "content": "TEXAS: At least 21 people have been killed in a series of powerful storms that swept across the central and southern United States, leaving a trail of destruction and devastation. The storms caused deaths in the US states of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky, just north of an oppressive, early season heatwave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early on Monday after tornadoes ripped through the state. “It was a tough night for our people,” Beshear said on social media platform X, later adding in a press briefing that “devastating storms” had hit almost the entire state. The governor said “at least a few” tornadoes touched down in Kentucky over the weekend, including one that travelled on the ground for about 65km (40 miles). Officials said 100 state highways and roads were damaged by the storms. The extreme weather system, which struck the region beginning late on Saturday, overturned vehicles and ripped up homes, leaving a wake of deadly destruction in its path. The death toll over the Memorial Day holiday weekend included at least eight fatalities in Arkansas, seven in Texas, four in Kentucky and two in Oklahoma, according to tallies by state emergency authorities. The deaths in Texas came after a tornado tore through the Valley View area north of Dallas, Cooke County Sheriff Ray Sappington told reporters. It destroyed homes and a petrol station, and overturned vehicles on an interstate highway. In Oklahoma, at least two people were dead after a tornado hit Mayes County late Saturday, the county head of emergency management, Johnny Janzen, told the Fox News affiliate in Tulsa. In Kentucky, the latest place left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny community of Charleston. “It’s a big mess,” said resident Rob Linton. “Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever – no water, no power.” Hundreds of thousands of Americans faced power outages on Monday due to the weather, according to the Power Outage.

        "content": "OTTAWA (Reuters): Canada said on Monday it would grant temporary visas to 5,000 Gaza residents under a special program for Canadians’ relatives living in the war-torn enclave, a preparatory move in case they are able to leave in the future. That figure is an increase from the 1,000 temporary resident visas allotted under a special program for Gaza announced in December, the immigration ministry said in a statement, adding that many people had expressed interest. “While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time. With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves,” Immigration Minister Marc Miller said. The minister has previously said leaving Gaza is extremely difficult and dependent on approval from Israel. In one of its latest attacks, an Israeli airstrike triggered a massive blaze killing 45 people in a tent camp in the Gaza city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders. Canada has been sharing the names of Gaza residents who have passed preliminary screening to local authorities to secure their exit, Miller said. Israel and Egypt are important to the program’s efforts toward reuniting families in Canada, the minister said. A spokesperson for Miller said 448 Gazans had been issued a temporary visa, including 254 under a public policy, and 41 have arrived in Canada so far. Nearly 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s offensive in Gaza, according to the local health ministry, and an estimated 1.7 million people, more than 75% of Gaza’s population, have been displaced, according to the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. Israel launched its military campaign after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Rafah strike.",

        "description": "The discovery that pollution from a paper mill is contributing to the long-standing mercury poisoning afflicting Grassy Narrows First Nation is another example of widespread environmental racism, say federal MPs.",
        "content": "The discovery that pollution from a paper mill is contributing to the long-standing mercury poisoning afflicting Grassy Narrows First Nation is another example of widespread environmental racism, say federal MPs. The mercury contamination at Grassy Narrows dates back to the 1960s and ‘70s, when Dryden Chemical dumped roughly 10 metric tonnes of mercury into the English-Wabigoon River system. The pollution has caused serious health problems for the vast majority of members of Grassy Narrows and Wabaseemoong First Nations, including neurological issues, birth defects and more. “The reality is Indigenous communities, racialized communities have to continue to suffer when corporations pollute,” Edmonton-Griesbach NDP MP Blake Desjarlais said, pointing to the Grassy Narrow’s case and Danielle Smith’s government’s RStar program that “uses tax dollars” to remediate industry’s abandoned wells. And this is not the first recent, high-profile example of environmental pollution driven by corporate interest that has impacted Indigenous communities. Last year, it came to light that local Indigenous communities including the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation were not properly notified of seepage from tailings ponds until a large spill, nine months later, brought the issue into the spotlight. Imperial Oil and the Alberta Energy Regulator say there were no impacts to the water supply or environment, but this did not assuage the fear and anxiety felt by ACFN and Mikisew Cree First Nation members, many of whom rely on fish, game and gathering out on the land. Communities have long been calling on the federal government to conduct health studies on the cumulative impacts of the oilsands development, pointing to cases of a rare bile duct cancer. Then, in late April, Aamjiwnaang First Nation in Sarnia Ont. — also known as Chemical Valley due to the more than 60 petrochemical plants in the region — measured benzene levels 424 times higher than acceptable levels. Benzene is highly toxic and a known carcinogen, used in chemical manufacturing to produce certain types of plastics. The chemical is known to cause cancers and increase rates of respiratory illness. Aamjiwnaang First Nation said elevated benzene levels in the air from the Ineos Styrolution facility caused several community members to fall ill. In response, on May 17, Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault issued a 14-day emergency interim order to the petrochemical industry in Sarnia, ordering companies to implement abatement measures to contain pollution, including fully closed vents and vapour control on storage tanks that contain high concentrations of the chemical. News of the Grassy Narrows mercury poisoning made a stir in Question Period on May 23, when NDP MP Charlie Angus called it “an unprecedented corporate crime.” “We now learn that the Dryden Fibre Canada mill has been dumping sulfates into the Wabigoon River, which has been driving the mercury crisis for a new generation,” said Angus. He asked the federal government what it will do to hold the company accountable and clean up the contamination. Liberal MP Jenica Atwin pointed to an Indigenous Services Canada project that received $57.5 million in Budget 2024 to construct a care home to offer specialized care and assisted living to people with methylmercury poisoning. “We can’t just slap a hospital or a special medicalized program that’s going to help mercury victims, it should have never happened to begin with,” Desjarlais said. “Imagine if this happened in Montreal, imagine if we dumped all of the metallurgic chemicals into the St. Lawrence, how fast, how quickly this problem will be resolved,” he added. In recent years, sulfur and organic compound discharge from the Dryden Fibre Canada mill has created a dangerous chemical reaction in the Wabigoon River resulting in high levels of methylmercury, researchers from Western University said Thursday. The levels of methylmercury — the most toxic form of mercury — in the river’s fish may be twice as high as they would be without the mill discharge, the researchers said. “We have individuals who are eating the fish that is now highly contaminated with an even worse substance than they would have ever imagined,” Desjarlais said. “These things were preventable.” Desjarlais said there are two root causes for these repeated instances of environmental racism, the first being the current neoliberal economic system, which favours free markets and deregulation. “Neoliberalism has given corporations unfettered power to act as an individual, for the better pursuit of their own interests at the cost of other people,” he said. This should be countered by giving those same individual rights of corporations to water, air and the land, Desjarlais said. “The things we rely on most for our longevity as a species should be protected,” he said. He also advocates giving greater power to Indigenous jurisdictions, referring to the fact that Indigenous lands make up 20 per cent of the world, but contain 80 per cent of the world’s biodiversity. Green Party Leader Elizabeth May also called out Alberta’s tailings pond debacle as another example of environmental racism in action. “It’s been proven now for more than a decade that the toxic chemicals from the tailings ponds are reaching the Athabasca River, which is a violation of the federal Fisheries Act, yet no charges are laid,” said May in a phone interview with Canada’s National Observer. May has a private members bill that seeks to address environmental racism. Bill C-226 is one Senate vote away from becoming law. May said it’s unclear when the vote will be held, but the bill is expected to pass. Once passed, the bill will require the federal government to examine the links between race, socio-economic status and environmental risk as well as compel the environment and climate change minister to develop a national strategy to address the harms caused by environmental racism. May hopes the passage of C-226 will “result in a meaningful change” to get us beyond just talking about the pattern of environmental pollution and racism, by identifying the responsibility of governments to protect marginalized, racialized and Indigenous communities. She looks to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s environmental justice program — created in 1994 – as inspiration for what Canada should do. — with files from Paola Loriggio, the Canadian Press Matteo Cimellaro & Natasha Bulowski / Canada’s National Observer / Local Journalism Initiative",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — A former business associate of James Biden has agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to defraud Medicare of $51 million through a lab-testing company linked to the first brother. Keaton Langston, 39, admitted to using pharmacies, durable medical equipment companies and a laboratory in which he had a financial interest to bill for unnecessary tests and orders, the Justice Department disclosed last week in court filings. James Biden, 75, has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing and has sought to distance himself from Langston, whose father Joey Langston also was associated with the first brother. Keaton Langston founded Fountain Health, a lab company, in May 2017 and offered its services to rural hospital operator Americore Health, which later went bankrupt. Records show James Biden was involved with Fountain Health in 2017 before connecting with Americore, which provided him in $600,000 in loans in 2018 as he allegedly vowed to use his political connections to secure foreign investors . James passed $200,000 of the funds to Joe Biden in an alleged loan repayment. Shortly after the lab firm launched, Joey Langston emailed James Biden and his son Keaton and three others on July 12, 2017, about an upcoming “meeting for Fountain Health partners,” Politico reported in February. “Jim will report to the group the results of his discussions earlier today with a contact at [Blue Cross Blue Shield],” the elder Langston wrote. “There will also be discussion about how to proceed with the Union contacts that have been made by Jim and Keaton, within the last two weeks.” Paul Fishman, an attorney for James Biden, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but previously said his client “conducted himself ethically and honorably in all his business dealings.” Keaton Langston agreed in September to repay Americore $240,000 in a civil settlement. James Biden agreed in 2022 to repay Americore $350,000 . The Bidens and the Langstons have been linked financially for years. The elder Langston hosted fundraisers for Joe Biden when he was a senator, ProPublica reported . Joey Langston also loaned James Biden $800,000 , with most of the installments coming toward the end of the Obama-Biden administration in 2016, and ended up only being repaid $400,000 of the amount, he told House impeachment investigators in February. The wealthy Mississippi lawyer pleaded guilty in 2008 and was sentenced to three years in federal prison for being part of a plot to bribe a judge in an asbestos legal fees dispute. He was seeking to overturn his conviction when he made loans to the then-vice president’s son. Joey Langston’s alleged co-conspirator in the bribes case, attorney Dickie Scruggs, was involved in a second prosecution for attempting to bribe a different judge. James Biden was wiretapped by the FBI in 2007 as part of its investigation of the second bribery case, the Washington Post reported in December. James was in talks at the time with Scruggs and conspirator Tim Balducci about setting up a law firm that would have employed himself, his nephew Hunter Biden and James’ wife Sara. Then-Sen. Biden went from an opponent of federal legislation to sanction tobacco companies for lying about the addictiveness of cigarettes to a supporter after Scruggs — who planned a multibillion-dollar lawsuit — paid James Biden’s lobbying firm $100,000 in 1998, the Washington Post reported. “I probably wouldn’t have hired him if he wasn’t the senator’s brother,” Scruggs told the paper. Morning Report and Evening Update: Your source for today's top stories Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy . Never miss a story. Scruggs also flew Joe Biden to a fundraiser on his private plane, the Washington Post reported. Joe Biden has consistently claimed he “never” discussed business with his son or brother and said in December and again in March that he “did not” interact with their partners, including foreign associates in countries where he held sway as vice president. Evidence including photos, emails and witness statements indicate that Biden actually interacted with his son and brother’s associates from two Chinese government-linked business ventures and their patrons from Kazakhstan , Mexico , Russia and Ukraine . James Biden was a partner with first son Hunter in many ventures and allegedly wasn’t always coy about the angle he was pushing to investors. “We’ve got people all around the world who want to invest in Joe Biden,” James allegedly said in the early 2000s as he and Hunter were in the process of acquiring investment bank Paradigm , according to a 2021 book by Politico reporter Ben Schreckinger.",

        "content": "In a heart-wrenching incident, a distraught dog-owner found that her much-loved pet was up for adoption nearly a year after she had made the painful decision to put him down. Kristie Pereira, 32, received a devastating prognosis for her puppy Beau from a veterinarian who suggested the pup was dealing with an incurable neurological issue predicted only to worsen over time. However, Kristie was stunned to discover him listed on the website of the pet rescue center where Beau was initially adopted, almost a year after she'd painfully decided to euthanize him. Police officer shoots and kills blind, deaf dog Teddy in the street Woman has social media in stitches over dog's strange habit Kirstie was dealt a further emotional blow when the center declined to return Beau to her. Overwhelmed with grief, she recounted: \"The person that called me was so rude and just disrespectful and just being really nasty towards me. Just saying that I abandoned him, and that I left him to die. That I never cared about him. I want him back with me.\" In late 2022, Kirstie adopted Beau, then just two months old, at a cost of $450 (£353) from the Lost Dog and Cat Rescue Foundation in Maryland, USA. Soon after adoption, Beau's health issues became evident. Initial blood tests indicated a possible liver condition and Kirstie was furnished with liver enzymes for him. When Beaus condition deteriorated, three veterinarians reached the conclusion that his impaired bowel control and hind leg mobility pointed towards a serious neurological disorder. Kirstie was slammed with a staggering $12,000 bill for tests to diagnose her puppy, Beau, with the vet warning her that there was \"there's a very slim chance of finding what is wrong\" and \"an even smaller chance\" it could be treated. After discussions with the Lost Dog and Cat Rescue team, she made the tough call to euthanize Beau, believing it to be the kindest option. Living in San Antonio, Texas, Kirstie recounted, \"After I talked to them is really when I felt that I was going to be doing the right thing by putting him down.\" \"They really gave me that support and that encouragement that, although it's hard, sometimes that's the best thing to do.\" In a heartbreaking twist, Kirstie paid just $15 for Beau's euthanasia in March last year, under the shelter's policy which prohibits owners from being present during the procedure. However, during a recent trip to Maryland to visit her mother, Kirstie was shocked to find Beau alive on the rescue's website, now healthier and larger but still recognizable by his unique markings and the name Amos Hart given by the shelter, a nod to the musical \"Chicago\". The rescue center's vets had apparently found no neurological issues and instead treated a liver condition with a $7,000 (£5493) surgery funded by GoFundMe, after which Beau was declared healthy. Kirstie, who claims she was kept in the dark about these developments, has since offered to cover the $7,000 surgery cost to reclaim Beau. Chloe Floyd, a spokesperson for the rescue, stood by their decision not to return the dog to Kirstie. She stated: \"LDCRF does not re-home an owner-surrendered dog with its former owner. Our mission is to save adoptable and safe-to-the-community dogs from euthanasia.\"",

        "description": "Varanasi (UP), May 27: The people of Varanasi have decided that they will gift Prime Minister Narendra Modi his third-straight victory from the Lok Sabha... The post Ab ki baar, 10 lakh paar is Varanasi’s clarion call for PM Modi’s election battle appeared first on Greater Kashmir.",
        "content": "Varanasi (UP), May 27: The people of Varanasi have decided that they will gift Prime Minister Narendra Modi his third-straight victory from the Lok Sabha seat with a bigger margin of votes and they have given the clarion call of ‘Ab ki baar, 10 lakh paar.’ A young BJP worker, Aditya Singh, sums up the sentiments of the people of the constituency when he remarks, “The political heavyweights who are flocking to Varanasi, actually need not do so. They are here only to mark their attendance. Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not need any campaigning. Unka naam hi kafi hai.” In the last few days, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Union Minister Piyush Goyal, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav, Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Ministers Brajesh Pathak and Keshav Maurya, along with BJP President JP Nadda have campaigned here. While these bigwigs have been interacting with students, traders, artisans, weavers etc. the people of Varanasi – on their own – are campaigning for PM Modi. For instance, the Gujarati community held rituals that lasted several days to pray for a bigger victory margin for the PM. Music recitals and dance performances by artists from across the country, particularly southern India, serve as a reminder of the Kashi-Tamil Sangamam that the PM launched in 2022 to foster a cultural connect. BJP spokesperson KK Sharma said, “Varanasi has witnessed a remarkable makeover in the last ten years. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done much more than what he promised. The cultural scene is relatively vibrant. Infrastructure is better. Tourist footfall has increased manifold. The law and order has improved. It was a city that stayed indoors after dusk. Today, you will find people queuing up for the morning darshan and aarti from 2.30 A.M. onwards.” A local SP leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told IANS, “PM Modi has turned Varanasi from a domestic tourist destination to an international tourist attraction. So many Heads of State have visited the city and the footfall of foreign tourists is increasing by the day. We are contesting against him because it is a democratic compulsion but nothing actually matters when he is in the fray.” The electoral battle in Varanasi, according to locals and political experts, is not about whether PM Modi will win for a third-successive time, but whether he will increase his share of the votes polled and his victory margin and to what extent. “The people are chanting ‘10 lakh paar’ and everyone is excited to set this target for the Prime Minister this time. It will be our tribute to him,” said Lokesh Mazumdar, a local businessman adding that the people are treating the elections as a celebration of sorts. PM Modi had secured 56.37 per cent of the votes polled in Varanasi in 2014 when Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, had challenged him. In 2019, his vote share increased to 63.6 per cent. Interestingly, the number of contenders for the Varanasi Lok Sabha seat, which was 42 in 2014 and 26 in 2019, is only eight in 2024. According to the Election Commission’s website, as many as 55 people filed their nominations, but only the papers of eight contestants were accepted. He further said, “People are keenly observing the political landscape. The Congress candidate Ajay Rai, who is a part of the INDIA bloc, and BSP’s Ather Jamal Lari, are merely working to put up a decent fight. They also know that they are nowhere near the victory post.” The Opposition campaign in Varanasi is tepid. Their supporters claim that it was more vigorous in localities and nearby villages known to be supporters of the SP, BSP and the Congress. The INDIA bloc is also trying its utmost on a seat where the result appears to be a foregone conclusion. The Congress’ Priyanka Gandhi and the SP’s Dimple Yadav held a roadshow on Saturday. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi are scheduled to address a rally later this week, but though they are drawing crowds, it is unlikely to have any impact on the results. The enthusiasm and excitement in Varanasi, in fact, is bound to have a cascading impact across Purvanchal.",

        "description": "The Oakland Athletics and Tampa Bay Rays meet for the first time this season Tuesday night at the start of a three-game series at St. Petersburg, Fla., that matches a pair of clubs trending in opposite directions.",
        "content": "The Oakland Athletics and Tampa Bay Rays meet for the first time this season Tuesday night at the start of a three-game series at St. Petersburg, Fla., that matches a pair of clubs trending in opposite directions. In Oakland's 112-loss campaign in 2023, not much went right on or off the field. This season, though, manager Mark Kotsay's club is playing much better baseball and is out of last place, at least for the time being. Last week, during a six-game homestand, the American League West's fourth-place team split its six games and two series, taking two of three from the Colorado Rockies before dropping two against the Houston Astros. In Sunday's 5-2 setback in the home finale, shortstop Max Schuemann bobbled an easy two-out grounder in the fourth inning, committing two errors on the play and watching five runs (four unearned) cross the plate as the Astros went on to win the series. Kotsay said key miscues hampered his group in both defeats against Houston. \"The play is made and it's a one-run game,\" Kotsay said of Schuemann's gaffe. \"It really impacted the game. Physical errors are going to happen. Nobody is trying to go out there and make an error. Max has played a good shortstop. ... You look back on Friday's loss, we had one (bad) inning. Today, we had one inning that let the game slip away from us.\" Like the A's, Tampa Bay finds itself near the bottom of its division -- fourth in the AL East, leading only the struggling Toronto Blue Jays. Injuries have played a role in the Rays' struggles. Against Kansas City on Sunday, Brandon Lowe hit a three-run triple that helped the Rays earn a 4-1 victory to salvage the final game of the series. During their struggles this season, the Rays are finding it hard to win at home, which has not been the case during manager Kevin Cash's tenure. Entering the season, the AL East squad had a reputation for defending its turf and playing 8 1/2-inning games. Since the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, the Rays held a 176-96 mark (.647 winning percentage) at home, but this year's struggles have led to a 15-17 record including 1-5 on the current nine-game homestand. \"We're not getting it done,\" Cash said. \"Every facet of it. I mean, we're expanding on pitches that we probably can't handle. The pitches we can handle, we're not doing any damage with. We're not able to piece too much together right now. So I mean, it's kind of all-encompassing.\" In his 11th start, Rays right-hander Zack Littell (2-2, 3.42 ERA) will take the ball in the series opener. It is the first of seven matchups with the A's this season. Littell's last two starts were no-decisions against the Boston Red Sox when he combined to allow six earned runs in 10 2/3 innings with two homers. Over nine career appearances against the A's, all in relief, the right-hander is 0-0 with a 4.00 ERA. Oakland is expected to start rookie right-hander Mitch Spence (3-2, 4.09) for the first game of its six-game road trip.

        "content": "A LAWNCARE fan has dished the details on how they spruced up their home. After purchasing the abode, they noticed the shabby condition of the yard. Redditor Airgo1 shared the changes in a post on the social media platform. They said they bought the home when it was practically new, but wasn't too happy about the state of the landscaping, describing it as \"dead sod, clay, and sadness.\" \"I bought a new construction house a couple years ago, previous owner had lived there a year,\" they said. \"You all know the routine these builders do — strip the top soil and throw sod over yard debris and clay.\" The Redditor attached pictures of the yard, which was clearly dead on arrival. Determined to revive the lawn, they executed a plan to get some green back. \"After two years the lawn is getting to where I want it,\" they said. \"[This happened] after figuring out grubs were killing whatever seed grew. \"This spring I started seeding United Seeds' Avenger III Fescue. \"It still has a ways to go, but at least it’s not the worst lawn on the block any longer.\" United Seeds' Avenger III Fescue is sold for $52.50. There was a clear difference between the yard's initial browned appearance and the current state of bold, green grass. Several Redditors commented on the new look. \"Thank you from all the neighbors that care about their investment,\" one wrote. \"Lucky, you get to start from scratch,\" another added. \"Excellent,\" a third commented on the lawn. \"I did something similar to our townhome backyard. It was all rocks and mostly clay dirt. \"I still complain about it. Lol.\" The original poster specified that the yard was like working with a \"clay desert.\" \"I still have clover mixed in the back yard, when I was just trying to get some coverage over the dirt the first year,\" they said.",

        "content": "was all smiles when . The TV personality, , beamed from ear to ear as he returned to his Britain’s Got Talent presenting duties alongside close pal Declan Donnelly. The duo, who looked suave in matching navy blue three piece suits, reunited on Monday, 27 May for the first of this year’s Britain’s Got Talent live semi-final shows at the Hammersmith Apollo in London. Fans at home welcomed 48 year old Ant’s return to work with open arms and many took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to praise the TV presenter’s appearance on the ITV show. “Simon congratulating ant becoming a dad and the birth of his baby boy and he’s happy for him #BGT #Britainsgottalent,” wrote one. “Ant's first time on live TV since the birth of his child and he's happier than ever #BGT,” another added. “Simon saying congrats to ant and him having the biggest smile my heart #bgt,” wrote a third. Ant’s return to work comes just days after after welcoming Wilder into the world. As he greeted the monarch, 48 year old Dec explained that co-host Ant was unable to be at Buckingham Palace himself because he was on parenting duties - and part of that meant feeding his son. As he apologised to King Charles for his pal’s absence at the event for The Prince’s Trust, Dec, who attended the event with wife Ali Astall, joked that he “broke royal protocol” as he gave an update about his pal. After meeting the King, Dec admitted that he may have made a faux paus. He said: “I passed on Ant's apology that he couldn't be here today because he was at home breastfeeding.” With a laugh, he continued: “I don't know whether I broke royal protocol by giving that information.” The Prince’s Trust reception allowed the monarch to interact with winners of the Prince's Trust Awards as well as celebrities including Martin Freeman, Pixie Lott and Ellie Simmonds who presented awards. Speaking about the award winners, Dec said: “All the young people behind us here, some incredible stories again about people getting their life on track and making a real difference to their communities, and some incredible stories yet again.”",

The Pune Police on Monday submitted its enquiry report in a court stating there is prima facie truth in the complaint filed against Rahul Gandhi by V D Savarkar's grand nephew who had accused the Congress leader of defaming the Hindutva ideologue in a speech made in London in 2023.",
        "content": "Pune, May 27 (PTI) The Pune Police on Monday submitted its enquiry report in a court stating there is prima facie truth in the complaint filed against Rahul Gandhi by V D Savarkar's grand nephew who had accused the Congress leader of defaming the Hindutva ideologue in a speech made in London in 2023. The report was submitted in the court of judicial magistrate (first class) Akshi Jain, said advocate Sangram Kolhatkar, who represents Satyaki Ashok Savarkar, the complainant. Kolhatkar said the court may issue a notice to Rahul Gandhi seeking his appearance. Satyaki Savarkar had said his lawyers moved the city court with a complaint under sections 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code last April. The court had asked the Vishrambaug police to verify the proof submitted by Satyaki and submit a report by May 27. \"Vishrambaug police stated that Satyaki Savarkar had filed a complaint in the court last April accusing Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of making false claims about the late revolutionary (V D Savarkar) in a speech made in London in March 2023,\" said Kolhatkar. As per the complaint, Rahul Gandhi claimed in his speech that V D Savarkar had written in a book that he and five to six of his friends once beat up a Muslim man and he (Savarkar) felt happy. Satyaki Savarkar had said that no such incident had ever taken place, and V D Savarkar never wrote any such thing anywhere, the complaint stated, terming Rahul Gandhi's allegation as fictitious, false and malicious. \"The Vishrambaug police submitted a report today before the court and told the court that in their probe, it has been revealed that V D Savarkar had not written about such incident in any of his books but despite that Gandhi made that kind of remarks during his speech in London in March 2023 and defamed Savarkar,\" said Kolhatkar. Police stated that prima facie there is a truth in the complaint filed by Satyaki Savarkar that Rahul Gandhi had defamed V D Savarkar in his speech. When contacted Tukaram Nimbalkar, assistant police inspector, confirmed that the report had been submitted in the court. Notably, a metropolitan court in Surat last March convicted Rahul Gandhi of criminal defamation for his 2019 remark, \"How come all thieves have Modi as the common surname?\", and sentenced him to two years in jail. Subsequently, the sessions court granted him bail on April 3. The Supreme Court in August stayed his conviction in the defamation case.",

        "content": "A Massachusetts man was arrested Saturday in connection with two stabbings Saturday. Jared Ravizza, 26, of Chilmark on Martha’s Vineyard was arrested after the Porsche he was driving crashed, according to the . The crash followed an unsuccessful attempt by police to pull over Ravizza after two people were stabbed Saturday night at a McDonald’s in Plymouth, the outlet reported. The McDonald’s came after four girls between the ages of 9 and 17 were stabbed in a Braintree movie theater. Police believe the incidents are related. : Police are blocking off, shutting down the AMC in Braintree after a reported stabbing. We spoke with an employee who said multiple people were stabbed in a theater tonight. Several people reportedly rushed away by ambulance. More details to come. — Daniel Coates (@danielcoates_25) The X account identified Ravizza as a “trans activist.” An account that appeared to belong to the suspect said he is an artist who uses the pronoun “she.” A 2021 report in indicated that Ravizza was active in counseling people with disabilities. The Plymouth County District Attorney’s Office said he was arrested in Sandwich around 7:15 p.m. after the Porsche accident. Earlier, a McDonald’s employee was after a customer reached in through the drive-thru window and grabbed him, the Times reported. The suspect then stabbed a 21-year-old woman working at the McDonald’s. “Preliminary investigation suggests a likely connection to an earlier incident at a movie theatre in Braintree resulting in non-life threatening injuries to four juveniles,” the Massachusetts State Police said in a statement. According to the Times, Ravizza will arraigned in Plymouth District Court on Tuesday on charges of assault with intent to murder and two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. Those charges refer only to the McDonald’s incidents. The man who attacked the girls at the movie theater was “laughing the whole time,” Lisa Dembowski, the mother of three girls who were stabbed, told in Boston. Massachusetts stabbing spree suspect Jared Ravizza was ‘laughing’ during movie theater attack, mom says — Fox News (@FoxNews) “They had just sat down, they had just got their concessions. I guess he came up behind them, they were in like the second row,” she said. “He came up behind them. My oldest was leaned over to get something, he got her in the back. My other daughter in the chest. My last daughter across her arm.” Dembowski said the man stabbed their friend and left. She said the girls were . “They don’t want to go to the movies ever again,” Dembowski said. “Shaken up. They are physically fine. Kids are resilient. But I think they are terrified that they could just go to a movie on a Saturday night, and this could happen. Someone could just walk into a movie theater and someone could do this.” Dembowski said children face too many risks. “More and more this is happening, and it makes parents sick to bring their kids anywhere, or let them go anywhere without them. I absolutely feel that way,” she said. “I hope he gets what he deserves. I understand mental health. I’m a counselor. I understand it. I think it’s a pretty sick individual to harm children,” she said. Plymouth District Attorney Timothy Cruz said Ravizza was wanted for unspecified “other incidents,” according to .

        "description": "Friends and supporters of Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford say reports their marriage had been falling apart for months are wrong and that the TV couple's relationship broke down recently",
        "content": "The breakdown of Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford ’s marriage was very recent, their friends say. Some reports have claimed that the TV couple, who have announced they are divorcing, had been living completely separate lives since 2022. But while both have suffered immense personal challenges in recent years as they coped with bereavement, work and health issues, they have been very much living together and supporting each other until “the past few months”. Eamonn, who hosts on GB News, and Ruth who presents on Loose Women and shopping channel QVC, began this year muddling through together at their home in Weybridge, Surrey. “They did not split up two years ago, one year ago or even six months ago,” one friend said. “Their breakup has been very recent and only happened in the past few months. At the beginning of the year they were living together and working in the normal patterns, except for when Eamonn was off for reasons relating to his health. Eamonn Holmes announces new career move with glam pal, 40, after bitter Ruth split Holmes underwent surgery for back pain in October 2002 ( Image: Beretta-Sims/Raw Image Ltd) Ruth was by his side during an accident in January 2023 ( Image: Beretta-Sims/Raw Image Ltd) “To suggest that this has all been going on for years is simply wrong. It hasn’t. They have been juggling things and getting by as they have for a very long time. Their marriage broke down very recently and while it is a sad time for them both, they are absolutely determined to keep things amicable.” Friends have suggested that the idea Ruth is driving the divorce is also wide of the mark. “That’s not the case but whatever has caused them to divorce is private,” a pal said. “It is between them.” Eamonn and Ruth, who are both 64, have had a lot to contend with in recent years. His health woes and financial struggles over a tax bill have been widely reported, along with the death of his mother in 2022. Eamonn and Ruth have been married for almost 14 years ( Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock) He had surgery for his ongoing chronic back pain in October 2022 but things worsened considerably when he fell down the stairs at home during his recovery and broke his shoulder. In January of 2023 Eamonn described how Ruth had been by his side at the time of the accident, caused by his legs giving way. He explained: “I was on a curve of the stairs, and I just went back down the stairs, boom, boom, boom down the whole staircase until I hit the stone floor in the hallway. “Blood was pouring out my mouth, and a bone was sticking out my shoulder. Ruth came rushing down the stairs. She kept saying, ‘You’re fine, everything’s okay, you’re fine.’ I said, ‘Ruthie, there is a bone sticking out of my shoulder — I’m not fine’.” The couple endured a four-hour wait after Ruth called for an ambulance. Eamonn and Ruth at Buckingham Palace ( Image: PA) Eamonn said: “Ruthie put a pillow under my head and sat with me in the hall and we tried to sleep.” The following month the pair were pictured out celebrating their son Jack’s 21st birthday. And by the end of 2023 they were preparing for Christmas , with Ruth admitting that Eamonn’s ongoing health challenges were something they were getting to grips with. “With any care situation – and there are millions of carers in this country – it isn’t always easy, but if something happens to somebody you love, you help them,” she told a magazine. And looking forward to this year, she added: “For 2024, I obviously hope for Eamonn that his back improves, he’s not in pain and can move around more.” Ruth appears on Loose Women ( Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock) Eamonn moved to GB News after ITV ( Image: David Fisher/REX/Shutterstock) Much has been made of the couple being pictured leaving the TRIC awards in 2022 in different cars. But this, was not because they were living separate lives but because their schedules meant they needed to be in different places. Eamonn’s struggle over a tax bill ended a year ago when he lost his appeal – meaning he has since had to sell the home he maintained in his native Belfast in order to pay what was owed. For her part Ruth went through the shocking suicide of her sister Julia in 2019 and now cares for her elderly mother, who has Alzheimer’s and lives in residential care near their home. Eamonn and son Jack during a recording of Strictly Come Dancing ( Image: BBC) She has also spoken about her struggle with empty nest syndrome since the departure of son Jack, who is now 22, and lives in Manchester . Throughout all of this she has been caring for Eamonn – who at times has been barely able to walk, not only because of his bad back but because he had a double hip replacement in 2016. “Eamonn has been looked after and cared for by Ruth for a very long time,” one pal said. “How would she have been able to do that if they had not been together? It would be impossible. She has been there for him all this time, the split is a recent development not one that’s been secretly going on for years.” Eamonn has complained that ITV treated him unfairly when the pair were replaced by Dermot O’Leary and Alison Hammond on This Morning in 2020. But both have moved on with their careers – Eamonn is the regular host of GB News’ breakfast show from 6am each day while Ruth is on Loose Women. Both regularly supported the other’s ventures – he has spoken of his pride over her successful fashion venture via QVC, now in its sixth year, while she has been known to message in while he is on air to contribute.

        "description": "After his French Open first round exit Rafael Nadal has indicated he will not be playing at Wimbledon, focusing instead on a return to Paris for the Olympics.",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal has pledged to carry on playing as long as he is enjoying his tennis, despite a first round exit at Roland Garros at the slam he made his own, but strongly hinted he will not be playing at Wimbledon this year. Nadal said the rigours of switching to grass for the London showpiece, then reverting to clay for the Paris Olympics, would probably be too demanding given his age and recent injury issues. The 22-time grand slam champion lost in straight sets to No.4 Alexander Zverev on Monday - but showed enough flashes of brilliance to suggest he would have beaten most opponents. Having only recently returned from a near 18-month absence that has encouraged him to keep going - and to target more gold. Nadal won singles gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and doubles gold at Rio 2016. That this year's tennis tournament will be on his favourite court, where he won 14 French Open singles titles, has further tempted him. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. However, that does mean Wimbledon, where he won in 2008 and 2010, is likely to be sacrificed. He has only competed in SW19 once in the last four years - in 2022 when he had to withdraw through injury ahead of his semi-final with Nick Kyrgios. \"It looks difficult, honestly, to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,\" said Nadal. \"I'm booked in Wimbledon because I had to, [but] I don't think it's a positive idea right now. \"I need to talk with the team. I need to analyse so many facts. But I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back to clay.\" Nadal, 38 next week, missed most of 2023 with a hip problem and this year's comeback was hampered by a muscle tear, then a series of minor issues affected his Paris preparation. \"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect. I wake up one day and I find a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,\" Nadal added. \"I've been fighting with all the things that I went through. But the dynamic is positive the last few weeks. I felt ready. I think tomorrow I'll be ready to play again if I have to. But I will not have to. \"Now, I need to prepare myself, I need to clear my ideas and see what's the new calendar to try to be ready for Olympics. My main goal now is to play the Olympics.\" Longer term, sounding much like his old friend and rival Andy Murray who also lost in the first round in Paris, he said he wanted to carry on playing while he was healthy and having fun. And even in defeat on the clay where he had so rarely lost before, he had fun. \"If it's the last time that I played here,\" Nadal said, \"I am at peace with myself.\"",

        "description": "Martha-Ann Alito told a Post reporter in 2021 the flag was \"an international signal of distress.\"",
        "content": "LOADING ERROR LOADING The Washington Post published previously unreported details about a flag associated with former President Donald Trump ’s “Stop the Steal” movement that was flown outside Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito’s home in 2021 . On Saturday, the Post revealed it first spoke with Martha-Ann Alito, the justice’s wife, in January 2021. Alito told the Post the flag — an American flag flown upside down — was “an international signal of distress” that was present as part of a dispute with her neighbors. Advertisement That reporting corroborates a statement Justice Alito gave The New York Times, which released an investigation into the flag earlier this month. “I had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,” Alito said. “It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor’s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.” According to The Washington Post, reporter Robert Barnes, now retired, first visited the Alitos’ home to report on the flag on Jan. 20, 2021 — President Joe Biden ’s inauguration day. The Alitos, who did not attend the inauguration, ran into Barnes while exiting their home, and Martha-Ann Alito shouted that Barnes should “ask them [her neighbors] what they did!” Cameron Barr, the former senior managing editor of the Post, told Semafor he decided not to run the story in 2021 “because it seemed like the story was about Martha-Ann Alito and not her husband.” The actions of the Supreme Court justices and their significant others have come under considerably more scrutiny in recent years after it was revealed Ginni Thomas, Justice Clarence Thomas’ wife, attended the Jan. 6, 2021, rally at the U.S. Capitol and made efforts to overturn Biden’s election win.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) Following its investigation of the upside-down flag, the Times published a report on another flag embraced by far-right groups being flown outside the Alitos’ beach home in New Jersey. The “Appeal to Heaven” flag , linked to the Christian nationalist movement, flew outside the beach home in the summer of 2023. Some Democrats have asked Chief Justice John Roberts to meet “as soon as possible” to discuss the flag controversy, arguing Alito should recuse himself from Supreme Court cases relating to the 2020 election.

        "content": "MADRID: Spain has pledged 1 billion euros ($1.1bn) in military aid to Ukraine as Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have signed a security deal in Madrid. The deal “includes a commitment for 1 billion euros in military aid for 2024”, Sanchez said at a joint news conference on Monday. The pact, which covers the next decade, calls for the supply of modern military equipment for ground, aerial, naval and other uses, “prioritising Ukraine’s key capacity needs”, and an emphasis on protecting sea routes for Ukraine’s food exports, but it gave no specifics. “It will allow Ukraine to boost its capabilities including its essential air defence systems to protect its civilians, cities and infrastructure, which are still suffering indiscriminate attacks as seen this weekend in Kharkiv,” Sanchez said, referring to a Russian strike on the northeastern city that killed at least 16 people at a hardware hypermarket on Saturday. Zelenskyy visited the Spanish capital as Ukraine battles a Russian ground offensive in the Kharkiv region that began on May 10 in Moscow’s biggest territorial advances in 18 months. With Russia’s full-scale invasion now in its third year, Ukraine has been pleading for more weapons for its outgunned and outnumbered troops, notably seeking help to address its lack of air defence systems. Sanchez said Spain had already pledged to supply Patriot missiles but what Zelenskyy needed from Ukraine’s allies was “the systems to launch these missiles”. In a post on the social media platform X, Zelenskyy thanked Spain for “its tangible and truly life-saving support to Ukraine in this time of war” and said he also discussed how Madrid could play a role in strengthening Kyiv’s air defences. Spain will send “another batch of Leopard tanks and above all ammunition”, Sanchez said, pledging to keep working with Kyiv “to understand how else – and with what other alternative systems – we can help ensure Ukraine’s air security”. Zelenskyy has signed bilateral security agreements with several other countries, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom. He said Ukraine needed at least seven more Patriot missile launchers to defend itself and would pressure its allies to obtain them. The president said Russian forces have used about 3,200 guided aerial bombs this month. “How do you fight that? There aren’t enough air defence missiles to stop thousands of bombs a month. ... Those partners who are afraid to give us this or that weapon should understand that air defence is defence, not offence,” he added. Zelenskyy will next visit the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, where he is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Luis Montenegro and President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa on Tuesday and is expected to sign a similar 10-year agreement.

        "content": "New Delhi, May 27: A heat wave will sweep across most of the states in the country in June, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast on Monday. “Above-normal monthly maximum temperatures are likely over most parts of the country in June, except many parts of the southern peninsular India, where normal to below-normal temperatures are most likely,” the IMD said. Above-normal heat wave days are likely over most parts of northwest India and adjoining areas of central India during the next month, the IMD forecast states. Above-normal monthly minimum temperatures are also likely across most parts of the country in June, except for the extreme northern parts of northwest India and a few pockets of east and northeast India, where normal to below-normal minimum temperatures are most likely, the IMD said. The IMD has also warned that during heat waves, vulnerable populations, like the elderly and those with health conditions, face risks of heat-related illnesses. Prolonged extreme heat strains infrastructure and leads to dehydration. Authorities must act proactively by opening cooling centres, issuing advisories, and reducing urban heat islands. These steps are crucial for protecting public health during heat waves. One has to stay hydrated, remain in an optimally cool environment, and avoid strenuous activities during peak heat hours to stay safe during heat waves.",

        "description": "Harbor Freight has a wide variety of budget-friendly tools, including heat guns. But who makes them and how many cordless options are there?",
        "content": "When it comes to budget-friendly tool deals , few names can beat Harbor Freight. The iconic store has been around since 1977 , and it's been providing quality tools at affordable prices ever since. While many people think of Harbor Freight for its wide selection of mechanic's tools , the store stocks nearly every type of gadget you can think of, from electrical devices to HVAC supplies and more. It even stocks several heat guns. These niche tools are commonly used in the automotive and electrical industries, where technicians use them for things like removing gaskets, applying shrink wrap to electrical connections, and performing auto body repairs. However, heat guns aren't limited to those industries, and you can use them for everything from working with fiberglass to removing old stickers from various surfaces. Harbor Freight sells five different heat guns. Two of those tools are made by Bauer, one of Harbor Freight's many in-house brands . Two more of Harbor Freight's heat guns are made by Hercules, another one of the store's tool lines , while the last heat gun is built by Warrior, which is, you guessed it, another one of Harbor Freight's in-house brands . The prices are what you'd expect from Harbor Freight, with the cheapest tool starting at $19.99 and the most expensive one coming in at a modest $59.99. Three of them are corded, while the remaining two are battery-powered. Let's dive in and take a deeper look. Harbor Freight's two cordless heat guns are made by Hercules and Bauer. The Bauer heat gun is the cheapest of the two and costs $39.99. It uses a 20-volt battery and is capable of temperatures up to 825 degrees Fahrenheit. The tool features an LED light to help you work in all conditions, a guard nozzle to protect your work and materials, and concentrator and deflector nozzles for fine-tune heating. The Bauer heat gun has a quick-release collar, making removing or installing attachments quick and simple, while a six-second cool downtime contributes to a longer internal coil lifespan. The tool is well-rated by customers and features 4.1 out of five stars based on 216 reviews. However, it does not include a battery or charger, and if you want to buy those items, you'll need to fork out roughly $100 more. Harbor Freight's second cordless heat gun is made by Hercules and costs $49.99 . It's also powered by a 20-volt battery and can produce temperatures up to 905 degrees Fahrenheit. The tool features high-performance coils, capable of reaching max temperatures in five seconds, a guard nozzle to protect yourself and your work, and a built-in LED light to help you see your projects in all conditions. The Hercules heat gun is also well-rated by Harbor Freight customers and features 4.2 out of five stars based on 102 reviews. Like the Bauer tool, the Hercules heat gun does not include a battery or charger. If you need to buy those items, it'll cost you around $120 extra.",

Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 3.23 days to cover their short positions on average. Why Short Interest Matters Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises. Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Wayfair Short Interest Graph (3 Months) As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Wayfair has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted. Comparing Wayfair's Short Interest Against Its Peers Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis. According to Benzinga Pro , Wayfair's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 13.70%, which means the company has more short interest than most of its peers. Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock? This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.

        "content": "A Pennsylvania couple has gained internet fame for their \"pronatalist\" goal of having many kids. Now the parents have come under fire after the father publicly slapped his toddler in the face. The parents, Malcolm and Simone Collins, told BI they think the backlash is overstated — and racist.

Advertisement Remember the American couple who's following in the steps of the ultra-rich people who want to repopulate the world with their children? Now they're in hot water after publicly smacking one of their kids. Malcolm and Simone Collins previously told Business Insider that they're on a mission to have a litter of children because, as pronatalists, they want to \"set the future of our species.\" This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . \"I do not think humanity is in a great situation right now. And I think if somebody doesn't fix the problem, we could be gone,\" Malcolm Collins previously told BI in 2022. The couple has done several interviews with the press in an effort to explain their objectives as a couple and speak on behalf of a burgeoning pronatalist movement . Advertisement But a recent interview the couple gave to The Guardian is getting a bad reception. The Guardian described a scene when Malcolm Collins slapped one of his toddlers in public after the child \"knocked the table with his foot and caused it to teeter, to almost topple, before it rights itself.\" \"Immediately – like a reflex – Malcolm hits him in the face,\" The Guardian's Jenny Kleeman wrote. \"It is not a heavy blow, but it is a slap with the palm of his hand direct to his two-year-old son's face that's firm enough for me to hear on my voice recorder when I play it back later. And Malcolm has done it in the middle of a public place, in front of a journalist, who he knows is recording everything.\" Malcolm Collins resumed his conversation with the stunned reporter after telling his child: \"I love you but you gotta be nice in restaurants. No, Toastie. You're going to get bopped if you do that.\" Related stories Soon afterward, the episode went viral on X — the platform owned by Elon Musk, whom Malcolm Collins was incidentally gushing over moments before striking his toddler. Advertisement \"The pro-natalist couple hits their children,\" one X user said, sharing a screenshot of the article. \"Jesus Christ the kid is two!!!! My kid is two!!!! The idea of hitting her has simply never occurred to me and if you know any two-year-olds it should be obvious how obviously nuts it is to do this!!!!\" another shared on X . In an email to Business Insider, Simone Collins said the toddler, named Torsten Savage, was intentionally acting out, and tipping over a table with glassware on top of it \"could be deadly in a house with infants\" if it were to happen at the couple's Pennsylvania home. \"He is an incredibly sweet, smart, analytic kid, but he also has a major rebellious streak and is in the middle of his twos. This is all to say that yes, 100%, Torsten was pushing boundaries and not acting unintentionally,\" Simone Collins wrote. \"Incidents in which we 'bop' our kids are unusual—usually when physical safety is at stake.\" Advertisement Over the phone, Malcolm Collins told Business Insider that he \"bopped\" his son on the nose to jar him, not to hurt him. The couple chose the punishment specifically after observing \"animal parenting models,\" he said. \"Basically, across the nose is what we aim for,\" Malcolm Collins said. \"The reason I think it's better than a slap on the wrist is because it doesn't need to be painful to have the same impact. By that, what I mean is when somebody enters the space around your face, it is very shocking and very reorienting, especially if you're in an emotional loop, which is easy for kids to get into.\" He added: \"The only way you could achieve the same effect by hitting a child's wrist is to hit it large enough to cause a significant amount of pain, which I wouldn't want to do, but I can understand why visually people might be, 'Oh, the slight hit on the nose or the face is really bad' because it looks visually bad.\" The couple both said they found the backlash they faced on social media to be racist since, they argued, minorities often hit their children without the same backlash. Advertisement \"We are kind of shocked by the racism threaded throughout this recent controversy. It is pretty well-documented that African Americans and other minority groups practice corporal punishment much more than other groups,\" Simone Collins said via email, linking to a CNN article published in 2011. Malcolm Collins said it was \"uniquely offensive\" to him considering \"the majority of Americans practice some form of corporal punishment, as you can see from the statistics with specifically that being the minority groups of Americans. So yeah, I think it's an arguably racist position.\"",

        "content": "New Delhi, May 27: Cyclone Remal struck the coastal regions with wind speeds reaching up to 130 kmph, losing much of its strength as it passed over the Sundarbans, which acted as a natural shield. Several structures were destroyed, and many trees were uprooted in the coastal areas. Reports from North and South 24 Parganas and East Midnapore districts indicate extensive damage to thatched roofs, electric poles, and trees. Severe flooding affected low-lying areas near Kolkata. Authorities are still assessing the full extent of the damage caused by the cyclone. The centre of the severe cyclone landed between Khepupara in Patuakhali, Bangladesh, and Sagar Island in West Bengal. Bangladesh, located east of the cyclone’s eye, bore the brunt of the storm. Over one lakh people were evacuated to safer areas in the coastal districts of West Bengal. The cyclone brought heavy rains and tidal surges, with waves reaching one to two meters in Bengal and up to three meters in Bangladesh around midnight. According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), wind speeds reached up to 120 kmph, with gusts up to 135 kmph as the storm hit West Bengal’s Sagar Island and Bangladesh’s Khepupara area. The system is expected to move north-north-eastwards and gradually weaken into a cyclonic storm over the next few hours. The IMD bulletin at 6:30 am on Monday indicated that the system was weakening after landfall. At the time of landfall, the cyclone had maximum sustained surface wind (MSW) speeds of 110-120 kmph, gusting to 135 kmph. By 4:30 am, the MSW had decreased to 85-95 kmph, gusting to 105 kmph. The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) reported that a marine heatwave of moderate intensity impacted 38% of the Bay of Bengal basin on Friday. This unusual warmth contributed to the intensification of Cyclone Remal, although other conditions were not conducive to its further intensification. Earlier warnings from the IMD predicted extremely heavy rainfall in the coastal districts of West Bengal and heavy to very heavy rainfall in northern Odisha on Sunday and Monday. Assam and Meghalaya and other northeastern states, including Manipur, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, and Tripura, may receive some showers on Monday. Flights from Kolkata remain suspended and are expected to resume by late afternoon. An Airports Authority of India (AAI) spokesperson confirmed that around 400 flights, both domestic and international, will be grounded during this period. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has issued advisories predicting heavy rainfall and strong winds in Tripura and other northeastern states from the night of May 26 to May 29. Local administrations, along with the Indian Coastal Guard, have relocated thousands of fishermen’s families and continuously advise coastal residents to seek safer locations. Several makeshift camps have been established by volunteers and officials to provide shelter. The Indian Navy has initiated extensive preparatory actions, following Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), to ensure a robust Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) response. Two ships equipped with HADR and medical supplies are on standby to support the affected areas.",

Why Short Interest Matters Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises. Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Broadcom Short Interest Graph (3 Months) As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Broadcom has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted. Comparing Broadcom's Short Interest Against Its Peers Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis. According to Benzinga Pro , Broadcom's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 4.65%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers. Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock? This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.

        "content": ", one of TVF (The Viral Fever)'s most popular shows, is also one of Amazon Prime Video's most followed Indian shows. A satirical comedy series, Panchayat follows the journey of engineering graduate Abhishek, who, unable to find a better job, becomes the secretary of a Panchayat office in a remote Uttar Pradesh village. Created by Chandan Kumar and directed by Deepak Kumar Mishra, the first season of premiered on April 3, 2020, followed by the second season on May 20, 2022.

The series stars Jitendra Kumar, Raghubir Yadav, Neena Gupta, Sanvikaa, Chandan Roy, Durgesh Kumar, Ashok Pathak, Faisal Malik, and Sunita Rajwar. In season 3, the plot thickens with the arrival of a new secretary and the protagonists' clash with the local MLA. Unfortunately, the new season was pirated on its release day, with reports indicating that season 3 was leaked on torrent sites such as MovieRulz, Tamilrockers, 1337x, and Telegram channels in high-definition format. This incident is part of a growing trend where movies and shows are quickly pirated upon release, despite efforts to combat these illegal activities. Even with previous attempts to block these sites and enforce restrictions, they persist, enabling the spread of piracy. Cybercrime authorities must take stronger actions against these platforms. . Returning to S3, director Deepak Kumar Mishra, who is also one of the writers, shares insights on how the story connects seamlessly with the previous seasons, ensuring long-term audience engagement. Mishra hints at spoilers, discussing how Neena Gupta’s character, Pradhan ji, faces a challenge to her position, adding an intriguing twist to the series.",

The crash happened Sunday at Silver Lake State Park Sand Dunes in western Oceana County, about 270 miles (430 kilometers) northwest of Detroit, MLive.com reported. Police said the driver of a modified Jeep CJ lost control, veered off the racing strip toward the crowd and hit another vehicle, causing that vehicle to strike 33-year-old spectator Kadie Price of Pierson. Price pushed her 2-year-old daughter to safety just before she was hit, sparing the girl serious injury or worse, police said. Price died shortly after the crash. An investigation is ongoing.",

        "description": "A nation-wide moving company that threatened to drive away with a Chilliwack, B.C., couple’s furniture, has compensated the customers nearly $1,000.",
        "content": "A nation-wide moving company that threatened to drive away with a Chilliwack, B.C., couple’s furniture, has compensated the customers nearly $1,000. In early May, Kim Jans and her husband hired Let’s Get Moving to help them move from South Surrey to their new home in Chilliwack, based on excellent feedback on the company’s website. “The reviews were absolutely fabulous,” said Jans. The couple had already moved a lot of their belongings themselves using a U-Haul, and all that was left were about 30 boxes and the heavy furniture from a two-bedroom home. Jans ordered a 26-foot truck with three workers, for $229 an hour. But on a moving day, the wrong truck arrived, one Jans figured was too small to fit all of their furniture. It took another two hours for the right one to arrive. “In the meantime, they kept loading up the wrong truck, and I kept saying to the workers ‘please stop,'” Jans told CTV News. Then she said it took the movers about five hours to load the right truck, almost twice as long as she expected. “I could just see them standing inside the truck, just standing there chatting,” she said. But the most alarming moment for the couple, came when the movers got to the couple’s new home. The workers stopped unloading the truck before it was completely empty, and presented the couple with a bill. The grand total read $3,486.53, and was about a $1,000, or four hours more than they anticipated. She said the movers wouldn’t unload the rest of the furniture, until they paid up. “When we challenged the bill, they pretty much said, ‘no this is the bill, this is the amount, and you need to pay it, or we're going to drive away with the remaining items that are in the truck,'” Jans recounted. “They hold you hostage once they get your property in their truck. You are completely held hostage,” she said. The couple felt they had no choice, and paid the bill on the spot. They filed an official complaint with Let’s Get Moving, and although the company responded almost immediately, they couldn’t agree on compensation. But when CTV News asked Let’s Get Moving for comment, Jans heard from the owner of the South Surrey franchise a few hours later. “I am deeply sorry for the mistakes that occurred,” read the email from Daniil Sychev. He also followed up with a phone call, and offered to refund the couple $961.80 for a move that he agreed “should've been done a little bit faster.” Jans found him sincere, and accepted the compensation. Sychev confirmed some movers will be getting more training, and at least one is no longer with the company. From the head office in Toronto, Let’s Get Moving representatives told CTV News that it is running a good company with excellent service and that “90 per cent of customers are very, very pleased with us.” They acknowledged that in order to get paid, movers have refused to unload furniture in the past, but that it is not company policy. “That should never happen,” said customer representative, Kelvin Anil. What remains is a settlement agreement that customers are asked to sign when they receive compensation. It states that they are not allowed to say or post any negative comments about Let’s Get Moving or “the customer specifically and IRREVOCABLY agrees to pay the company liquidated damages in the amount of $5,000.” In the end, Jans did not have to sign.",

        "content": "Watch the trailer for NCIS' Ducky tribute episode WARNING: This article contains spoilers from NCIS. NCIS season 22 will follow-up on that cliffhanger ending which put Jimmy and Jessica’s relationship in jeopardy. When season 21 ended earlier this month, Jessica Knight (played by Katrina Law) was offered a promotion working as the new REACT chief training officer at Camp Pendleton. This meant that she would have to relocate to the other side of the country and following a particularly terrifying mission, she decided to take it. Her relationship with Jimmy Palmer (Brian Dietzen) has been a little shaky as of late and this could be the final nail in the coffin if they decide long distance won’t work for them. And now a CBS viewer has shared that this could open a door for Jimmy to get himself a new girlfriend. Read more: NCIS season 22 could see Agent Sam Hanna take over from Jessica Knight NCIS season 22 to see Jimmy find ‘someone else’ as fan predicts end of him and Jessica. (Image: CBS) Sharing their theory with the Reddit community, they wrote: “I believe that Palmer will find someone elsewhere at the office, and Jess comes back on a case to find out Palmer moved on.” They went on to add that Jessica would be “distraught” at the thought of Jimmy falling in love with someone else “but would come to accept it” if she did choose to return. If season 22 is going to start with Jessica leaving the team, then her spot as an agent would need to be filled, meaning a potential new cast member. Jessica’s particular role has always been filled in by a feisty female agent as well, from Caitlin “Kate” Todd (Sasha Alexander) and Ziva David (Cote de Pablo), to Ellie Bishop (Emily Wickersham).

(Image: CBS) So could it be that Jimmy will find himself in a relationship with Jessica’s replacement in season 22? Even though this theory is plausible, not everyone on Reddit seemed to be on board with the idea. In response, a fellow viewer wrote: “First NO Jess will not leave all is a plot and cliffhanger out of storyline. “Somewhere Nick will ask her ‘Are you sure? You got us and you have a family and [are] a step-mum to Victoria!’ And no Jimmy will not find someone else like people think!” Trending SUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

        "content": "The global pandemic in 2020 was memorable for the TSX, particularly for . If not for and , Canada’s primary stock market index would not have ended 2020 with a 2.2% positive return. The e-commerce platform delivered a substantial 184.8% overall gain for the year. Shopify quickly became the TSX’s darling for its meteoric rise. In May 2020, it also became the country’s most valuable company, unseating the . But in a sudden twist post-pandemic, the stock plummeted. The Big Bank reclaimed the throne in 2021, and SHOP lost 74.8% in 2022. Fast forward to 2024 and SHOP is down 24.5% year to date. Also, at $77.67 per share, the total return in 3 years is -47.2%. The rise to superstardom was phenomenal but fleeting. Today, the hype is on artificial intelligence (AI), not e-commerce anymore. ( ) is the top candidate if you’re looking for the next growth star in the North. The tech stock flew under the radar when Shopify was climbing in 2020. It rose from obscurity in 2023 following a 159.8% overall return. As of this writing, the share price is $80.73 per share, a year-to-date gain of 107%. If you had invested $6,500 (222 shares) at year-end 2023, your money would be $17,835.04 in May 2024, But why Celestica? Unlike Shopify, the company never incurred losses beginning in 2020. Net income has been consistently increasing yearly in the last four years. Celestica is cross-listed in the NYSE and is slowly getting attention from American investors for its growing earnings and market-beating returns. Those who missed out on can shift to the Canadian stock. The AI stock is too pricey after topping US$1,000 recently, while Celestica is cheaper with enormous price appreciation potential. The $9.5 billion company provides supply chain solutions and products to clients in North America, Europe, and Asia. It caters to cloud-based firms, defence, and industrial companies, including original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Celestica is known for its engineering expertise, notably from product and test development to assembly technology. Celestica takes pride in its proprietary SpectrumPro software platform in aftermarket services and support. The customizable web-based platform is for real-time data collection and machine integration throughout the manufacturing and repair process. The Advanced Technology Solutions (ATS) segment handles the aerospace, defence, industrial, health technology, and capital equipment markets. Its second reportable segment, Connectivity & Cloud Solutions (CCS), serves communications and enterprise (servers and storage) end markets. In Q1 2024, revenue rose 20% year over year to US$2.2 billion, while net earnings jumped 312% to US$101.7 million compared to Q1 2023. The quarterly financial results were impressive, notwithstanding materials constraints that caused production delays. Management said this is a continuing risk in the mid-term, especially for high-demand components and materials. NVIDIA dominates the AI scene, but Celestica is well-positioned to garner significant market share. The Canadian firm developed the Photonic Fabric, an optical interconnect platform for AI computing and memory infrastructure. Besides the foundational technology to unleash AI advancements, the Photonic Fabric boasts sustainable and profitable business models. Celestica can match, or even better, NVIDIA’s returns.",

        "description": "Dollarama (TSX:DOL) looks like a great buy, even at these frothy levels.The post Dollarama Stock: Time to Close the Register? appeared first on The Motley Fool Canada.",
        "content": "Whenever a stock surges to a new all-time high, some shareholders may naturally be inclined to ask themselves if it’s a good idea to ring the register. Undoubtedly, taking profits after a seemingly extended (perhaps even overextended rally) can be a good idea, especially if the fundamentals haven’t gotten much better since the rally began. At the time of writing, shares of Canada’s top discount retailer, ( ), are starting to get overheated. Though I’d be tempted to sell with shares near a peak, I think that who do so may stand to miss out on further performance. When it comes to taking profits, investors must realize there’s the risk of being left out of a rally’s continuation. At this juncture, I’d argue that Dollarama stock is getting a tad ahead of itself, now up more than 50% in the past year alone and over 80% in the last two years. What’s behind the boiling surge? Dollarama continues to win the business of many loyal Canadian consumers seeking super-low prices. Indeed, Dollarama’s strategy is simple and predictable. Consumers just love a good deal The company has outstanding direct sourcing deals and relationships with suppliers at home (think Canadian-branded snacks) and overseas (China and Vietnam, specifically). Such impressive relations have helped Dollarama bring in goods at incredibly steep discounts. And it’s Dollarama’s willingness to share in on the savings that’s won it such a massive following in recent years. The past four years have been really tough on Canadian consumers, with the price of everything soaring while wages are barely budging higher. Whenever the amount of money that goes out (spending) surges while the money coming in (income) stays the same, or worse, falls due to recent layoffs in the tech and financial sectors, consumers need to cut spending accordingly. Normally, it’s enough to cancel a few of those unused monthly subscriptions. But with inflation running rampant for many years now, some consumers have had to cut on utilities, food, and other necessities. Dollarama stands out to me as the best discount retailer on the continent. Why? The management team would rather keep prices as low as possible to attract repeat sales than obtain more margin from consumers. Indeed, Dollarama could charge a nickel more for any one of its already cheap goods to add to margins. In many cases, it just doesn’t. With such a focus on maximizing consumer value over padding margins, it’s no mystery why Dollarama is soaring while other discount retailers are in a slump. Indeed, Dollarama has the magic formula, which should lead to predictable earnings growth over the next seven years or so as the firm grows its unit count. Dollarama is expanding fast! The company is steadily expanding, and as it aims to open its 2,000th store in 2031, I find DOL stock will likely be trading much higher than where it is today. At the in-store level, Dollarama gets top grades for offering a slew of great, affordable products that allow consumers to fill up their baskets without going into shock once they head to checkout. The only question is whether the company can continue driving sales growth at this magnitude as disinflation or even deflation (don’t cheer for that, folks!) becomes a potential new reality a few years from now. I think Dollarama will do well, regardless of where prices, as a whole, are headed. Why? Customers know they’re getting very competitive prices (at least for goods in smaller form factors) on everything over at Dollarama. All considered, I’d rather buy DOL stock than sell it right now.",

        "content": "fans are convinced they have worked out who Sarah Barlow will fall into bed with next on the cobbles. Over the past years, the blonde bombshell’s (played by Tina O’Brien) love life has been following her separation from her husband Adam Barlow. The couple separated after she dated and fell pregnant with TV bad boy Damon Hay (Ciaran Griffiths) behind his back. After he discovered her infidelity, the couple separated with the solicitor demanding a divorce. Since then, she has had an on-off relationship with Gary Windass behind his partner Maria Connor’s back. But viewers believe the TV favourite may have set her eyes on another resident in the village. During Monday’s visit (May 27) to the ITV cobbles, Sarah was caught red-handed trying to plant evidence that could get her daughter Bethany Platt’s assailant arrested for her murder. At the start of the episode, Nathan Curtis (Chris Harper) drove past the journalist, breaking her restraining order on him. But the builder argued that he didn’t break her order because he believed she still lived in London. When Bethany reported him to the police, PC Craig Tinker confirmed that there was nothing they could do. It was at this point that Sarah decided to take matters into her own hands when she found one of Lauren’s bobbles in the Barlow family home, wrapped in strands of her hair. As she stormed over to the builder’s yard, the doting mum was caught red handed by new detective Kit Green moments before she hid the evidence. Thankfully, the newcomer was kind to the heartbroken mum and let her off with a warning as they had a heart-to-heart in his car. Before he let her go, he swiped the incriminating evidence as she insisted that Nathan was responsible for Lauren’s murder. Later on in the episode, Sarah checked in on her daughter, but her day quickly turned around for the better. Just as Sarah brought Bethany in for a comforting hug, her boyfriend Daniel Osbourne announced that her assailant had been arrested and taken away in handcuffs. It was at this point that fans flooded to X – formerly known as Twitter – to share their suspicions online. Many are convinced that Sarah will fall in love with the hunky new detective on the street in a matter of days. One user penned: “How long till Sarah starts making her bedroom eyes at Bernie’s son [cry0laughing emoji] #Corrie.” Another agreed: “I loved Adam/ Sarah together but... I like Kit & Sarah together... #corrie.” A third echoed: “Sarah will end up bedding Kit... I can sense it #Corrie” as a fourth chimed in with: “Is this the start of Sarah and the copper getting it on keep on watching [shifty eyes emoji, cry-laughing emoji] #corrie.”",

        "description": "“We can't forget about the victims. Even though he wasn't charged with all of them, we can't forget about all the other women that he wasn't charged with.\"",
        "content": "As convicted serial killer Robert Pickton clings to life in Quebec after being stabbed by a fellow inmate, family members of one of his Edmonton area victims wait for justice — and for answers. “I want to feel like it’s completely closed, and I have a feeling ... the whole truth is not out yet,” said Kristina Batemen, daughter of Pickton victim Georgina Papin , who was from the Enoch Cree First Nation, bordering Edmonton’s western edge . Although he was convicted in 2007 for the deaths of six women, Pickton once bragged to an undercover cop that he had killed 49 women. The remains or DNA of 33 women were found on Pickton’s pig farm in Port Coquitlam, B.C. Georgina Papin’s remains were discovered at the Pickton farm in July 2002. Stabbed a week ago with a broken-off broom handle wielded by another inmate at the maximum-security Port-Cartier Institution, Pickton lay in an induced coma in a Quebec hospital as doctors weighed whether to wake him up to see if he could survive. Bateman, who lives in Las Vegas, is party to one of several ongoing lawsuits filed by Vancouver lawyer Jason Gratl against Pickton and his brother, David Pickton, by family members of victims . Like her lawyer, Bateman believes Pickton had an accomplice. “He mentioned to authorities that other people were involved — investigators should still be looking into the allegations. I don’t feel like justice has been served completely,” said Bateman. “And I’m still going to always be trying to find the truth — more of the truth.” Gratl, representing family members of victims in nine lawsuits against the Pickton brothers, has said the potential death of the killer would have no bearing on proceedings. “Robert William Pickton’s state of health or well-being — I don’t anticipate it will have any significant effect on the progress of the civil trial,” he told The Canadian Press. A B.C. Supreme Court hearing is scheduled for June 26 to hear applications for standing in the RCMP’s bid to dispose of 14,000 pieces of evidence, mostly collected during the 18-month-long search of Pickton’s farm in 2002 and 2003. Gratl said a bigger issue than whether Pickton survives is the potential destruction of the evidence. “I act as legal counsel for 16 children of nine women who were killed by Robert Pickton,” he said. “It’s in their interest to preserve the evidence seized by the RCMP on the Pickton farm to allow my clients to prove that Robert Pickton and David Pickton caused them to suffer loss.” In 2014, the botched investigation into Pickton resulted in a settlement of $50,000 for the victims’ children who had sued all three levels of government and the RCMP. Gratl said statements by the defence, Crown and jury also “strongly suggest a shared belief that he did not act alone and others may be implicated in the deaths of the six women Robert Pickton was convicted of killing.” Bateman was raised in Las Vegas by her father’s side of the family, but was close to her mother, and stays in touch with her other surviving seven siblings, the children of Georgina Papin. She believes that what goes around is coming around for Pickton. “Karma was definitely involved. For evil people that do things like what he did, I think he definitely deserved it,” Bateman said. “We can’t forget about the victims. Even though he wasn’t charged with all of them, we can’t forget about all the other women that he wasn’t charged with.” Had she lived, Georgina Papin would have turned 60 on March 11. “I know she’d have been a great grandmother,” Bateman said, wistful for her two children who never got to know their grandmother. “We talk about her every day, like she’s still in our lives. And we sing happy birthday to her every year.” Yvette Papin was raised with her cousin, Georgina Papin, spending many happy hours with their mutual grandmother. She remembers Georgina as sweet and loving, a woman who put others first. “Georgina never had any issues with anybody at all, not even a fight or an argument. That’s just how beautiful and sweet she was,” she said. Listening to accounts of the attack that left Pickton near death, Yvette finds herself torn. “A part of me was sad but a part of me was happy — it just kind of triggered a lot of mixed emotions on what their siblings, the children are going through,” Yvette Papin said. Pickton deserves to suffer for all the suffering he caused others, she said. “I don’t wish this upon anyone, but it was expected to turn around and come back to him eventually. I don’t think he’s suffering enough. Don’t get me wrong — I don’t wish suffering on anyone, but what the women went through — I can’t imagine. I will not imagine just what they had to endure before they passed away,” she said. “This is a lot of trauma not only to the families, but to the investigators,” Yvette Papin said. “What he got was nothing compared to what he’s done to the women.” jcarmichael@postmedia.com",

        "content": "The royal family is sending their condolences. Prince William and Kate Middleton honored the death of Mark Long , a British Royal Air Force (RAF) pilot who crashed while flying a World War II-era Spitfire plane on May 25. \"Incredibly sad to hear of the news this afternoon from RAF Coningsby,\" the couple shared on X , formerly known as Twitter, the same day. \"Our thoughts this evening are with the pilot's loved ones, the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, and the wider RAF family.\" Mark's death was confirmed by Group Captain Robbie Lees , who called the pilot a \"great friend, colleague, and a passionate, professional aviator.\" \"An investigation into the cause of this tragic event has now begun,\" the May 26 statement explained . \"The RAF will not be offering any comment on the accident until that investigation has concluded, and likewise, we ask others not to speculate.\" \"I would like to extend a sincere thank you to the RAF personnel and our emergency services colleagues who responded so swiftly yesterday,\" the message continued. \"Our thoughts remain with Mark's family and friends to whom we offer our deepest sympathies. We ask that their privacy be respected at this tragic and shocking time.\" The Spitfire is the most famous British fighter aircraft in history, according to the Royal Air Force Museum . It became a symbol of freedom in the summer of 1940 when it was used against German air attacks during the Battle of Britain. And it's no surprise that Kate and William professed their love and grief for the late pilot. The couple—who share kids Prince George , 10, Princess Charlotte , 9, and Prince Louis , 6—is deeply involved with the RAF. In fact, King Charles III bestowed William with the title Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps earlier this month, a title the monarch held for 30 years. Kate—who's been out of the spotlight recently after being diagnosed with cancer—was also given a new title when taking over her husband's previous role as Honorary Air Commandant Royal Air Force Coningsby in August. Now, read on to keep up-to-date with the royals. Nearly two months after the Princess of Wales went public with her cancer diagnosis, a spokesperson for Kensington Palace said the royal has no immidiate plans to return to her public-facing duties . \"The princess is not expected to return to work,\" the rep said in a May 21 statement to BBC, \"until it's cleared by her medical team.\" On May 13, King Charles III bestowed the title of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to his oldest son, sparking controversy as many royal watchers believed the title would be more suited for Prince Harry , who trained and served in the military branch. On April 26, nearly three months after sharing his cancer diagnosis, Buckingham Palace announced that Charles will return to public-facing duties . The queen consort attended the Royal Maundy Service on March 28 in place of King Charles III , making her the first spouse of the Monarch to continue the ancient tradition . In a March 22 video message, the Princess of Wales shared that she'd been diagnosed with cancer after undergoing abdominal surgery in January. \"It was thought that my condition was non-cancerous. The surgery was successful,\" she said before noting that tests after the operation found cancer had been present. \"My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy and I am now in the early stages of that treatment.\" After photo agencies pulled the picture Kensington Palace shared of Kate since having her abdominal surgery on March 10, the Princess of Wales addressed claims the photo was doctored. \"Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing,\" she tweeted on March 11. \"I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused. I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother's Day. C.\" Princess Diana 's niece celebrated Mother's Day in the U.K. by sharing she and her husband Michael Lewis privately welcomed their first baby. “It’s the joy of my life to be your mummy, little one. I love you unconditionally,\" she captioned her March 10 Instagram post . \"Happy Mother’s Day to those who celebrate today.\" After keeping up her full slate of engagements in the wake of her husband's cancer diagnosis, the palace cleared Camilla's schedule. The Times pointed out March 2 that the 76-year-old didn't have any engagements on her calendar until March 11, when she'd be due at Westminster Abbey to observe Commonwealth Day. The husband of Lady Gabriella Windsor and ex-boyfriend of Pippa Middleton , was found dead Feb. 25. Days later, a coroner's inquest found that he died by suicide. While King Charles III was in the hospital for his benign prostate enlargement procedure, the royal family member was diagnosed with cancer . \"His Majesty has today commenced a schedule of regular treatments, during which time he has been advised by doctors to postpone public-facing duties,\" Buckingham Palace said Feb. 5. \"Throughout this period, His Majesty will continue to undertake State business and official paperwork as usual.The King is grateful to his medical team for their swift intervention, which was made possible thanks to his recent hospital procedure. He remains wholly positive about his treatment and looks forward to returning to full public duty as soon as possible.\" The Duchess of York's rep said in a statement on Jan. 21 that Sarah was recently diagnosed with malignant melanoma, an aggressive form of skin cancer. Several months prior, she underwent a single mastectomy to treat breast cancer. On Jan. 14, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark made history as she officially abdicated the throne, handing the crown over to her son, now known as King Frederik the 10th . Kensington Palace announced on Jan. 17 that Kate Middleton underwent planned abdominal surgery and was set to remain in the hospital for 10 to 14 days. \"Based on the current medical advice,\" the Palace said, \"she is unlikely to return to public duties until after Easter.\" Amid Kate's recovery, Prince William postponed a number of engagements as he supported his family, including the couple's three children, Prince George , Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis . Shortly after Kate's hospitalization was made public, Buckingham Palace shared that Charles \"has sought treatment for an enlarged prostate.\" \"His Majesty's condition is benign and he will attend hospital next week for a corrective procedure,\" the statement added. \"The King’s public engagements will be postponed for a short period of recuperation.\" Princess Claire and Prince Felix of Luxembourg welcomed son Balthazar Felix Karl on Jan. 7, the first royal baby of the New Year!",

        "content": "Alabama football has a great opportunity in front of it win a College Football Playoff National Championship. Nick Saban’s decision to retire was probably one of the best things that happened to the Crimson Tide. Alabama gets a fresh reset with Kalen DeBoer and a hunger to prove why it remains the best program in the sport. The Southeastern Conference has done away with divisions and the Tide lost a lot to the NCAA transfer portal, but it should remain in peak position for a national title. Some feel like Alabama will suffer a major setback, but three reason are below on why the Tide win a national title? Jalen Milroe Alabama has one of the best retuning quarterbacks in college football. Jalen Milroe is back with experience and hunger. He carried the Crimson Tide to a Southeastern Conference Championship last season and returned to the CFP. Milroe earned Most Valuable Player honors in the SEC Championship Game, but he finished the 2023 season with 2,834 passing yards, 531 rushing yards, and 35 total touchdowns. The 6-foot-2, 220-pounder has worked this offseason to assure the masses he is a complete player at quarterback. He made huge strides with his passing mechanics in spring practice, and has continued to progress under Yo Murphy and Jordan Palmer training him. Milroe wants every naysayer to know that Alabama is still the measuring stick of college football. His fire, drive, and improvement as a passer should have the Tide winning a national title. Coaching staff has something to prove Kalen DeBoer and his staff want to show they can win in the SEC. They took this opportunity at Alabama for the resources, the competition, and wanting to come behind a legend in Nick Saban. Names such as Nick Sheridan, JaMarcus Shephard, Kane Wommack, Maurice Linguist, Colin Hitschler, and Christian Robinson don’t have the resumes of former assistant coaches for the Tide, but they have the energy, motivation, and teaching skills to This article first appeared on Touchdown Alabama Magazine and was syndicated with permission.",

        "content": "A former member of the House of Representatives Tajudeen Yusuf has ruled out the possibility of an alliance between Peter Obi and Atiku Abubakar. Talks of an alliance between Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in the 2023 election, and his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) counterpart Atiku gained mileage following a meeting between the duo some weeks back. Obi was Atiku’s running mate in the 2019 presidential election under the PDP before the former joined LP in the leadup to the 2023 poll. But Tajudeen does not see both working together when Nigerians head to the ballot in 2027. “They have worked together before in 2019. It would not be out of place if they work together again. I am not in their minds but I don’t see the possibility,” he said on Monday’s edition of Channels Television’s Politics Today. According to him, Atiku’s comment after the meeting and other roadblocks make an alliance between the duo a herculean task. “They met a few days ago and after the meeting, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar came out to say he will continue to contest as long as he’s alive and healthy,” the former lawmaker insisted. “To me, that was to send a signal to those, especially the media, who were running with the notion that Alhaji Atiku Abubakar might step down and shelve his political ambition for Peter. But the follow-up statement a week later clarified that.” He thinks both men may contest the poll in 2027 which makes talks of a merger difficult. READ ALSO: Obi Not Interested In A Merger Seeking Only Power, Says Tanko Also speaking on the show, a spokesman for the Obi-Datti campaign council in the 2023 election Yunusa Tanko also said his principal is only interested in a merger that will make the country better. “His Excellency, Peter Gregory is not interested in a merger that is only for the interest of seeking power. He is interested in a merger that will bring Nigerians out of the poverty level, bringing the Nigerian people to a comfortable state of health care,” he Tanko said. “Making sure Nigerians have potable drinking water; making sure the problem of power supply is being solved. “So, therefore, he is interested strongly in a merger that is driven by ideology and a programme. But if it’s only for the purpose of power, he is not interested.”",

        "content": "Clothes dipped in toxic have been sent to inmates, says a shock report into a prisoner’s death. Burglar Jamie Tate, 33, was found dead at Strangeways in Manchester in March 2021, after allegedly being supplied with some of the socks. The report by Prisons and Probation Ombudsman Sue McAllister said: “Intelligence suggested prisoners were having clothes sent into them by friends and family that had been soaked in psychoactive substances and then smoking the ripped-up fabric.” A fellow inmate had told his mum to dissolve 50mg fentanyl tablets – an opiate painkiller – in water and soak socks in it. He then gave some to Tate. The report added: “The inmate distributed it on the wing and it had led to prisoners collapsing.” Prison bosses have been warned by Ms McAllister: “More needs to be done to reduce both the supply of, and demand for, psychoactive substances.” A e for allowing inmates to get rid of their most irritating or troublemaking cellmates. The Category B prison, meaning its home to highly dangerous prisoners for whom an escape must be made very difficult, allows fellow cons to kick out misbehaving roommates by way of a vote cast during regular \"wing meetings\". Glendon Prison, in Buckinghamshire, generally only accepts well-behaved cons from other jails. The inmates must then adhere to strict rules and if they fail to do that they can be exiled from the place by their peers, If booted out, they are made to return to the jail they originally came from.",

A “self--inflicted wound” could be to blame if Donald Trump is found guilty in his hush money trial, a former federal prosecutor told the Washington Post . Jim Walden, who is now in private practice, said the former president's constant attacks on the judge in his case — coupled with disrespect from a witness — are likely to backfire when jurors start deliberating this week. \"The thing that I think Trump just doesn't get is, even if you don't like the judge, the jury is going to like the judge,\" Walden said. \"When you're super disrespectful to someone the jury sees as a professional person doing their job, that's a self-inflicted wound. \"Whatever else Donald Trump may be — a great businessman, a great reality TV show host, a great politician — he's a dumb lawyer.” Among major errors in Trump’s defense, Walden said, was calling attorney Robert Costello to the stand. Costello infuriated the judge by rolling his eyes and making snide remarks while being questioned. Judge Juan Merchan’s fury forced him to clear the courtroom to reprimand the witness. \"Costello was a disaster,\" Walden told the Post.

Eight acts are set to perform tonight, with each of them hoping they have a chance to make it through to the last round of the competition.

Thank you for your lovely gift. Judges - still waiting on yours!\" Britain's Got Talent has been plagued with 'fix' rows over the years. How many of these do you remember? Jasmine Elcock - 2016: Teenage singer Jasmine Elcock stunned the nation with her version of Cher's Believe. But it then transpired she had already performed professionally in London's West End. Jasmine, 14, admitted: \"I’ve performed in Annie in the West End at about the age of nine or 10, but I really get nervous.\" IrShad Shaikh - 2017: BGT fans were left questioning the rule book when IrShad Shaikh auditioned. He got four red buzzers from the judges, which would usually mean an instant dismissal. Yet in a strange turn of events, they let him continue with his act...and put him through to the next round. Colin Thackery - 2019: Elderly war veteran Colin won BGT in 2019, but there was an outcry over the final. He warbled his place to win with a version of We'll Meet Again but fans were furious that escapologist Jonathan Goodwin didn't even rank in the top three. Viewers felt Jonathan - who almost suffocated while being buried alive in a gravel pit - should have won. Axel Blake - 2022: Comedian Axel Blake was given a Golden Buzzer in 2022 after making the judges laugh. But fans were fuming when they discovered Axel already had a show on worldwide streaming platform Amazon Prime. Despite this, Axel still went on to win the series. Loren Allred - 2022: The 2022 series of BGT was hit with another controversy when singer Loren Allred also received a Golden Buzzer. She performed Never Enough from the smash hit musical movie The Greatest Showman and got a standing ovation. It later transpired Loren was actually the original voice behind the track. Taryn Charles - 2024: Singer Taryn Charles is one of this year's hopefuls lucky enough to receive the Golden Buzzer. Bruno Tonilio put her straight through to the semi-finals following her performance of (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman by Aretha Franklin , but it has now come to light that she is no stranger to TV. Viewers recognised Taryn from an episode of ITV1's Starstruck, where she impersonated Whitney Houston for judges Olly Murs, Sheridan Smith , Adam Lambert and Beverley Knight . Dec is said to have been coaching his co-star and best friend through being a dad for the first time. The pair reunited yesterday to host The Prince's Trust Awards at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London. Now they will be introducing audiences to each semi-finalist of the night before returning home to their families.

        "content": "( KTLA ) – Mike Tyson suffered a medical emergency on a flight headed to Los Angeles from Miami on Sunday night. “Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great,” Tyson’s representatives said. “He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare-up 30 minutes before landing. He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.” Reports that the flight was delayed due to the emergency are inaccurate, Tyson’s reps said. The flight took off two hours later than scheduled. “It’s false reporting that his medical attention caused the flight delay,” his team stated. “This two-hour delay was due to an air conditioning issue on the aircraft.” According to In Touch Weekly , the flight was also delayed 25 minutes once it landed at LAX as paramedics boarded the aircraft to tend to Tyson. This comes a little under two months before Tyson, 57, is set to return to the ring after almost 20 years. On July 20, about a month after his 58th birthday, he’ll take on 27-year-old Jake Paul in a boxing match at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The fight will be streamed live on Netflix.",

        "content": "By Curtis Williams HOUSTON (Reuters) - Trinidad and Tobago received six bids from BP (LON: BP ), Shell (LON: RDSa ) and US shale producer EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG ) on four blocks to explore for oil and gas as its 2023 shallow water auction closed on Monday. Trinidad plans to announce the winners in four months, Energy Minister Stuart Young said at the closing of the auction. All three companies bid for the Modified UC block, which is close to the Teak, Sammaan, Poui producing fields. The auction had no other bidders. Trinidad is Latin America's largest producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), with installed capacity of 15 million metric tons per year of the super-cooled gas. It also is one of the world's biggest exporters of methanol and ammonia, but its plants have been operating below full capacity in recent years due to a lack of gas. In October 2023 the Trinidad government put out 13 blocks for bids. Monday's results mean that nine of the 13 blocks did not receive any interest and all the bids were from companies already operating on the Caribbean island. EOG Resources bid on three blocks, the Modified UC; the Lower Reverse L, which is west of Shell's Manatee discovery and on the border with neighboring Venezuela; and NCMA 4, in an area operated by Shell. Shell had one bid on Modified UC while BP, which bid on Modified UC also placed a bid for NCMA 2 which is north of Trinidad and not in the Columbus basin where the company has operated since the 1970s. Trinidad made several changes to the fiscal terms to attract more bids after the failure of its 2019 bid round, including reducing the tax liability for shallow-water producers, raising cost recovery to 60% from 50%, cutting the windfall tax to 50% from 70%, increasing the exploration period to eight years from six years and lowering the bid fee to $30,000 from $40,000.",

        "content": "Smartphone ban for kids 'worth considering' - MPs 3 days ago Nathan Standley , Vanessa Clarke Share BBC / Ann Gannon Schoolboy Jasper says having social media is important for 'finding people you can connect with' The next government should consider proposals to ban smartphones for under-16s within its first year, a committee of MPs has said. The Education Select Committee report outlined some of the \"serious dangers\" posed to children online. Government guidance to bar phone use in schools in England earlier this year prompted a debate on how much screen time children should be having. But children's charity the NSPCC said that so far, the voices of the young people themselves had been \"glaringly absent\" from it. The report, published on Saturday, said the risks of increased screen time for children and young people significantly outweighed its benefits. Committee chairman Robin Walker said its inquiry had heard \"shocking statistics on the extent of the damage being done to under-18s\". The report found there had been a significant rise in screen time in recent years, with one in four children now using their phone in a manner resembling behavioural addiction. The report said almost all children own a phone by the age of 12, and that 79% had encountered violent pornography before the age of 18. It said the Online Safety Act, which puts responsibility on social media firms to protect children from some legal - but harmful - material, would provide some protection, but not until the law was fully implemented in 2026. The committee says that without urgent action, more children could be put in harm's way. It recommended the next government should work with the regulator, Ofcom, to... Nathan Standley",

Scottish leader, Alex Cole-Hamilton, accused the SNP and Conservative governments either side of the border of \"neglecting\" services and turning parts of the UK into \"dental deserts\". UK leader Sir Ed Davey joined him at a campaign event in North Queensferry, and predicted the Lib Dems would make gains in Scotland and become the UK's third largest party. He said his party would not form a coalition with the Conservatives, but did not rule out an agreement with Labour. \"There are lots of hypotheticals but I'm going to focus on the campaign,\" Sir Ed told BBC Scotland News. Sir Ed said electing Lib Dem MPs would help to \"send a message\" to the SNP government, who he accused of \"failing\" on NHS dentistry. Although he acknowledged dentistry was a devolved issue, the party leader said UK-wide measures, such as cutting VAT on children's toothbrushes and toothpaste, would have an impact in Scotland. He told BBC Scotland News the NHS was the biggest issue for voters north of the border. \"It is things like GPs and dentists and hospital times and cancer waiting times,\" Sir Ed said. \"And then issues like sewage and the state of the economy. \"This is an election...

        "content": "What is the Tory national service plan and how might it work? 13 hours ago Sean Seddon , BBC News Share Reuters The Conservatives have set out a plan to require 18-year-olds take part in a form of national service if the party wins the general election on 4 July. Rishi Sunak said the scheme would promote a \"shared sense of purpose among our young people and a renewed sense of pride in our country\". Labour has labelled the plan a \"gimmick\" and other parties have criticised the government for its record on cutting troop numbers. However, there is still much we do not know about how it would work. Here is the detail we have so far. What is the national service scheme? The proposed new scheme would not be conscription, where people are legally required to join the armed forces for a period. But it would compel people by law to complete a community programme over a 12-month period, or enrol in a year-long military training scheme, when they turn 18. The name is taken from the mandatory military training British men aged 17-21 had to undertake between 1949 and 1960. Then, national service meant 18 months of military training and spending four years on a reserve list, meaning they could be called up to fight at short notice. The scheme being proposed now would not force anyone to do military training, Home Secretary James Cleverly told the BBC. It would be made up of two broad streams for 18-year-olds to choose from: Community volunteering: Spending one weekend every month - which equates to 25 days over a 12-month period - volunteering with organisations such as the NHS, fire service, ambulance, search and rescue, and critical local infrastructure Spending one weekend every month - which equates to 25 days over a 12-month period - volunteering with organisations such as the NHS, fire service, ambulance, search and rescue, and critical local infrastructure...

The Conservatives have pledged that, if they win the general election, 18-year-olds will have to take part in a scheme involving military or non-military service. Mr Cleverly said it would \"address the fragmentation in society\" - but added that sending people to jail for not taking part was not being proposed. Labour said the plan was \"a desperate gimmick\" with no viable funding. Mr Cleverly told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme the move was about \"coming together\". \"Too many young people are living in their own bubble, whether that's a digital bubble or a social bubble. \"We want to get back to a situation where young people are mixing with people - in different areas, different economic groups, different religions - to try and find a way of addressing the kind of fragmentation that we see too much of,\" he said. The Conservatives say the scheme would involve 30,000 selective military placements where \"the brightest and best\" volunteers would get involved in cyber security, logistics, or civil response operations full-time for a year.

        "content": "Leaders pitch for votes on first campaign weekend 2 days ago Share John Swinney was among Scottish party leaders out on the campaign trail The leaders of Scotland's major parties have hit the campaign trail on the first weekend of the general election race. The SNP, Scottish Labour, the Scottish Conservatives and the Scottish Liberal Democrats held events across the country in the early stages of the campaign. John Swinney, Anas Sarwar, Douglas and Alex Cole-Hamilton have 41 days to make their case to voters before they head to the polls. The vote will take place on 4 July after prime minister Rishi Sunak's surprise announcement earlier this week. The first minister used his event in Glenrothes, Fife, to hone in on the SNP's anti-austerity message. He accused the Conservatives of presiding over a \"punishing and damaging process\" of reduced public spending, adding only his party could exert enough influence at Westminster to ensure the policy is reversed. However, Mr Swinney denied his handling of the Michael Matheson expenses scandal threatened to overshadow his campaign. The first minister took aim at the makeup disciplinary panel that recommended a 27-day suspension after the former health secretary racked up an £11,000 charge on a parliamentary iPad during a family holiday.

Mr Gove, first elected MP for Surrey Heath in 2005, is understood to have made the decision in the last couple of days. He is the most high-profile of the nearly 80 Conservative MPs who have stepped down ahead of the 4 July vote - alongside public health minister Dame Andrea Leadsom. Mr Gove has been a close ally of Rishi Sunak, who he said \"has the plan our country needs\".

        "content": "IRELAND AM star Alan Hughes has admitted he is \"terrified of dying\" after experiencing multiple tragic family deaths. The Virgin Media star first experienced grief at just 10 years old after his parents died within six months of each other. Alan has now opened up about his grief and how the passing of his loved ones has made him \"more determined\". Speaking to the RTE Guide , the 60-year-old discussed how he was orphaned at a young age after his mum and dad both passed away. Describing the tough time, he said: \"It was a shock for all the family. She [his mother] had been unwell, so I was in her room, just lying with her and she passed.\" The popular presenter also went through a hard period when his sister Doreen passed away, just a year after he got married to his husband Karl Broderick. The Irish star recalled the first time his sister met his partner and laughed: \"When Doreen first met Karl, she said 'I really like you but if you do anything on him, I'll come and haunt you!' \"Now, when something good happens for myself and Karl I say, 'Ah they are all looking down on us.\" And Alan's brother David sadly died back in 2017 after a short battle with lung cancer. The TV host has highlighted how his siblings passing has made him \"very determined\". He said: \"When you see your sister and your brother die at a youngish age, you just want to grasp life and live it. And I've always been a glass-half-full person.\" Alan told how he \"believes there is a God\" and \"hopes there is a life after this one\". He continued: \"I hope it's where I'll meet all those family and friends I've loved, but maybe I have that hope because I'm terrified of dying.\" Separately, Alan recently enjoyed a \"fun night\" with his husband and his fans have all said they looked \"very handsome\". The popular presenter and his long-term partner Karl Broderick got married in October 2011, however they have been together for over 30 years . Alan and Karl recently attended the fashion event of the year at the Platinum VIP Style awards. The happy couple documented themselves getting ready for the event. Alan posted the fun video to his Instagram with the caption: \"Fun fun night at the @vip.magazine style awards last Friday. \"Thanks to @guyclothing in Tullamore for dressing me and @karlbroderick for the night. Thanks @luykxbianca @taradolloconnor for the invite and to @intercondublin and @nickylogue1 for the lovely stay. \"So be honest who wore it better me or Karl.\" In the video, Alan and Karl could be seen standing in white robes as they held up suit bags with their outfits in them. The famous pair then walked towards the camera with big smiles and covered it up. In the next clip, the love birds both posed in smart suits while holding up two glasses of champagne. Alan stunned in a beautiful green blazer with a black satin trim. The 60-year-old finished off the look with a clean white shirt a black dickey bow and some black tailored trousers.

        "content": "oozes confidence when she's on stage and has millions of fans around the world who look up to her. What's more, the award-winning singer's life wasn't always this way, and her personality has changed a lot since her early years too. During a rare interview, her mom, Tina Knowles, gave an insight into what Beyoncé was like as a child, making the heartbreaking revelation that she was bullied for a while. Tina also disclosed that the Texas Hold 'Em hitmaker was incredibly shy as a child. The 70-year-old told Vogue: \"Beyoncé, she was very shy and she got bullied a bit, but the day that she stood up for someone—she didn't stand up for herself she stood up for them. I'm getting emotional talking about it. I was just, I couldn't have been more proud of her.\" Tina also spoke about her other \"girls\", daughter Solange and Kelly Rowland, who she often refers to as her third daughter. She said: \"Solange, was her signing a petition in school, she was only in, like, fifth grade and she was out getting petitions signed. So she's always been an activist. \"And Kelly was always this kid that just tried to protect everybody. I have a memory of her with her best friend Barbara and her being a mediator and just being this little peacemaker.\" Tina adores her family and recently gave an insight into her grandchildren's personalities too. During a chat with E! News, she gave a rare insight into the lives of Beyoncé's twins Rumi and Sir, six, who unlike their sister Blue Ivy, 12, have kept a lower profile in their young lives so far. She said: \"Rumi is amazing—an amazing artist, painter, and creator.\" Reflecting on the twins' flourishing creativity, Tina mused, \"How could they be anything else growing up in that environment?\" She emphasized that their family life is steeped in discussions about creativity and fashion, nurturing their innate talents from a very young age. Sir, on the other hand, shares more similarities with his father, Jay-Z. \"Sir is very quiet,\" Tina noted, revealing that he gravitates more towards numbers than fashion. \"He does all of the numbers stuff, so he's not into fashion as much,\" she explained, but quickly added that Sir is \"very, very smart,\" hinting at the diverse talents the twins possess. Beyoncé shares her three children with husband Jay-Z. Despite being one of the most famous couples, they are notoriously private when it comes to their personal lives. However, in the last year, the family have been in the news more and more thanks to Beyoncé's numerous projects, from her Renaissance World Tour - which saw daughter Blue step into the spotlight and join her mom on stage - to the release of her new country music album, Cowboy Carter. During the same interview, Tina spoke of her pride for Beyoncé stepping into the country music scene, which saw her recently make history as the first Black woman to top the country charts. \"We're from Texas,\" Tina explained. \"We’ve been part of that culture for a long time, and I was very excited about it.\" She described Cowboy Carter as a \"nice history lesson\" for fans, applauding Beyoncé’s ability to educate subtly through her music. \"She has this way of doing things subtly but educating, and so I’m really proud of that,\" Tina shared.

        "content": "Indigenous leaders were in Ottawa on Monday to call on the federal government to follow through on a commitment to fund a new hospital in Moosonee, along Ontario's James Bay coast. They say the federal government promised to set aside $1.3 billion to help build the hospital, but that money wasn't included in the last federal budget. The hospital would replace a 74-year-old facility in neighbouring Moose Factory, which is Canada's oldest, non-renovated hospital. \"It's not just a building, it is a symbol of the enduring colonial legacy our people are forced to confront daily,\" said Lynne Innes, CEO of the Weeneebayko Area Health Authority, which runs health-care services in the region. The Moose Factory hospital was built in 1950 as a tuberculosis sanitorium, where children who were taken from their home communities were isolated from their families and culture. Built in 1950, the Weeneebayko hospital in Moose Factory is set to be replaced by a new regional James Bay hospital currently under construction in Moosonee. (Erik White/CBC) Because Moose Factory is on an island, patients have to be transported by helicopter to receive care. Dr. Elaine Innes, the Weeneebayko Area Health Authority's chief of staff, said patients from James Bay communities often have to travel south to Kingston, Ont., for care. \"We struggle with providing specialty services,\" she said. \"We can no longer provide obstetrical care because we no longer have the health human resources.\" James Bay health authority says 'huge surprise' in federal budget could halt hospital construction New Moosonee hospital to replace 74 year old facility in Moose Factory Moose Cree First Nation Chief Peter Wesley extended an invitation for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to visit Moose Factory and see the state of the hospital. \"There's no other hospital where you walk down the hallway and the roof is caving in,\" Wesley said. \"This would not be tolerated in any other urban community. This would not be tolerated in Ottawa. This would not be tolerated in Toronto, or Sudbury. Why do we have to tolerate it as First Nations people?\" National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak says that in 2007, the federal government committed to help fund a new hospital in Moosonee. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press) Assembly of First Nations National Chief Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak thanked the provincial government for its support on the Moosonee hospital project, but said the federal government has fallen short. \"Now we need the feds to come back to the table,\" she said. Woodhouse Nepinak and others noted that the federal government agreed to support the new hospital in 2007, when plans were first unveiled. 'I'm not walking away from that commitment' Indigenous Services Minister Patty Hajdu previously said in the House of Commons that she remains committed to the project. \"I'm not walking away from that commitment and we will get that hospital built,\" Hajdu said. In an email to CBC News, Indigenous Services Canada spokesperson Ryan Tyndall said the federal government's 2018 budget included $158.4 million for the construction of the hospital. But Tyndall added that health care is a provincial responsibility. He said the federal government has \"significantly increased\" health transfers to the provinces to support them in delivering health care. In Ontario, those transfers went from $13.1 billion in 2015 to $20.3 billion in 2024.",

However, the pair have since put on a united front, with both Molly-Mae and Tommy sharing photos of her 25th birthday. Molly even shared a clip of Tommy surprising her with a delicious-looking birthday cake at home.

After sharing a number of pics, Molly-Mae revealed that she was staying in the lavish Estelle Manor - adding that she's wanted to visit the hotel \"for so long.\" Molly and Tommy continued to share snaps of their romantic getaway, just weeks after they each jetted off abroad - with Molly heading to her sister's hen do in Ibiza , while Tommy flew to Dubai to support his brother, Tyson Fury, in a boxing match. The couple's separate holidays raised a few eyebrows, and some eagle-eyed fans quickly pointed out that they had also not been interacting with one another on social media - with Molly-Mae even failing to publicly wish her fiance a happy birthday. After arriving back in the UK the couple shut down rumours of a split when Molly shared a photo of Tommy confirming he was back at their Cheshire home .

        "description": "Rafael Nadal was beaten by Alexander Zverev in the first round of the French Open on Sunday, with the 14-time champion giving an emotional speech to the crowd after the match",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal has addressed his future after a surprising first-round defeat to Alexander Zverev at the French Open. Despite avoiding direct comments about retirement, the 14-time champion in Paris hinted that this might have been his last appearance at Roland Garros. Despite a 6-3 7-6(5) 6-3 loss, Nadal believes he \"was not that far off\" and \"had his chances\" against the world No. 4, who had recently clinched the Italian Open. \"I played I think at a good level in all ways, compared to the way that I was playing the weeks before. So, happy for that. Of course disappointed for losing, but in terms of body feelings, happy that I finish healthy, you know, and I had a tough battle out there. And I was ready for a little bit more,\" he said, before making a significant remark about his future in Paris. \"So that's it. Accept the moment. If it's the last time that I played here, I am in peace with myself,\" he said with a smile, suggesting that he may have already bid his farewell to the French Open. \"I tried everything to be ready for this tournament for almost 20 years. And today and the last two years I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here, no? At least I did. I mean, I lost, but that's part of the business.\" Andy Murray's French Open journey ends in defeat to Stan Wawrinka as retirement looms World No. 1 Novak Djokovic candid about his struggles and modest hopes for French Open Despite the uncertain future for Nadal, one thing remains evident - the Spanish tennis ace is determined to participate in the upcoming Olympic Games, slated for Paris' iconic Stade Roland Garros. The 22-time Grand Slam champion revealed: \"I need to finish all this process. My mindset was ready 'til Olympics, you know, and then I need to check how I feel in different ways, I mean, in terms of personal motivation, body feelings, and then in terms of the level of tennis it makes sense to keep playing.\" Beginning to rediscover his form, the soon-to-be 38-year-old explained: \"For me the feeling of coming back home with the personal satisfaction to do all what's in my hands to make the things work well, give myself everything, that's the only way that I understand my life, you know.\" He further clarified. \"That's why I am not saying I am retiring today. You know, at the end, it's about not having the feeling in one year or one year and a half that, you know, I didn't give myself a chance, a real chance, you know, because immediately that I started to become a little bit healthier, I stop.\" Nadal, who is still relishing his time on the tour, expressed his desire to continue playing \"for a while\". He said: \"So in terms of what's driving me, what's the force behind driving me, I mean, as I said, I'm a simple guy. I enjoy what I do. You know, I am passionate about sport, I am passionate about competition. I like to practice, I like to play tennis. I'm in a different moment of my personal life too, traveling with my son, wife, you know. I am enjoying these moments that will not come back. \"So if I keep enjoying doing what I am doing and I feel myself competitive and healthy enough to enjoy, I want to keep going for a while. I don't know for how long, but I want to keep going for a while, because they are having fun, I am having fun, and I need to see, I need to give myself a little bit longer chances to see if my level is growing and my body is holding, and then let's make a decision.\" While he hinted at the future of his career, Nadal refrained from making any official statements. \"But give me two months till Olympics, and then let's see if I am able to keep going or I say, okay, guys, it's more than enough. Let's see. I mean, today is not a moment to analyze all these kinds of things. It's a moment just to keep going, accept the moment, and let's see what's going on,\" he concluded.",

        "content": "Cleveland Guardians star José Ramírez is known for being extremely confident, so it's not a surprise he compared himself very favorably to one of the best players in MLB history. On the latest episode of the Cleveland Baseball Talk Podcast (starts at 19:05 mark), Paul Hoynes explained that he was talking to Ramírez about receiving the Barry Bonds treatment when he drew a four pitch bases-loaded walk in the top of the sixth inning of Sunday's 5-4 win over the Los Angeles Angels. \"I'm better than Barry Bonds,\" Ramírez responded. The Angels didn't give Ramírez the full Bonds treatment because Bonds' most famous walk with the bases loaded was meant to be intentional. During a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 28, 1998, D-Backs manager Buck Showalter ordered Bonds to be intentionally walked with two outs, the bases loaded and his team holding an 8-6 lead over the San Francisco Giants. The move paid off because Brent Mayne followed Bonds by lining out to end the game with an 8-7 win for Arizona. Ramírez's walk turned out to be the difference in the game. It gave the Guardians a 5-2 lead at the time and they held on to win for their ninth straight victory overall. It's not hard to figure out why Angels manager Ron Washington didn't want to pitch to Ramírez in that situation. The five-time All-Star is hitting .325/.388/.766 with as many homers as strikeouts (10) in his last 20 games dating back to May 5. Ramírez hit three homers in the first two games of the weekend series against Los Angeles. He was hitless on Sunday, but still got on base twice via walks, drove in a run and scored a run in the win. The Guardians have been one of the most pleasant surprises so far this season. They enter Monday with the best record in the American League (36-17). Their current nine-game winning streak is the team's longest since their AL-record 22-game streak in 2017. Ramírez doesn't quite have as many accolades as Bonds. He's still chasing his first MVP award, so winning seven of them seems like it will be out of the equation. But when it comes to active big leaguers who teams would prefer not to face in clutch situations, Ramírez is likely to be very high on that list based on his current hot streak and long track record of sustained excellence.",

        "description": "Jared Ravizza, 26, is due to be arraigned Tuesday in Plymouth District Court on charges including assault with intent to murder, and two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon in connection with the stabbings, according to prosecutors.",
        "content": "PLYMOUTH — The Chilmark man prosecutors said stabbed two workers at a local McDonald’s, then injured himself when he crashed his car during a State Police pursuit in Sandwich Saturday night, was held without bail Monday after he was released from the hospital, according to the Plymouth District Attorney’s office. Jared Ravizza, 26, is due to be arraigned Tuesday in Plymouth District Court on charges including assault with intent to murder, and two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon in connection with the stabbings, prosecutors have said. Officials Monday released few new details about the investigation into the attacks, which State Police and Braintree police have said may be connected to the stabbing of four girls at the AMC Braintree 10 theater at about 6 p.m. Saturday, about an hour before the McDonald’s attack. Advertisement The attacks occurred at the McDonald’s location at the Route 3 service plaza around 7 p.m. Saturday. Prosecutors said surveillance video appears to show Ravizza grab a 28-year-old man working at the drive through window, and stab him with a large knife. Ravizza then parked his car, entered the restaurant, and stabbed a 21-year-old woman who also worked there, prosecutors said. After the attacks, Ravizza got back into his black 2018 Porsche Macan and fled the scene. A witness reported the car’s plates to State Police and troopers tried to pull Ravizza over, but he wouldn’t stop, authorities said. Ravizza crashed his vehicle in Sandwich, and he was arrested by troopers and local police around 7:15 p.m., officials said. He was taken to South Shore Hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries, and had remained in the hospital Sunday. The district attorney’s spokesperson did not have information about Ravizza’s attorney Monday, and no court files were available online. Ravizza is referred to using male pronouns on a professional website and in court papers. Ravizza uses “she” on Instagram. Advertisement At the McDonald’s location in Plymouth Monday, the restaurant was operating normally, with little sign of the chaos that unfolded less than two days earlier. Two managers on duty at the restaurant, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak about the event, both said that the stabbing was a “very scary” situation. They said the two employees who were injured in the stabbing had been discharged from a hospital and were in stable condition, and declined to provide any further details. In an emailed statement Monday, Mark McBee, a McDonald’s Franchisee who owns and operates several McDonald’s restaurants in the region, said he was grateful to law enforcement for their quick response to the stabbing incident at the restaurant. “We are shocked and devastated by this senseless act of violence,” McBee said. “The safety of our crew and customers is always our top priority.” McDonald’s did not provide further details about the health condition of the workers. On Sunday, Lisa Dembowski — the mother of three of the girls injured in the theater attack — said the girls were fine physically, but remained terrified following their ordeal. Dembowski’s twin 9-year-olds were injured, along with her 17-year-old and their friend. Dembowski criticized AMC staff for failing to immediately respond to the stabbings, and said employees initially didn’t believe the girls were stabbed. Her oldest daughter was the one who called police for help, she said. Advertisement “I give her an enormous amount of credit, because in my mind ... her and her friend kept the two little ones completely calm,” Dembowski said. AMC Theatres, in a statement sent Monday, said the company was saddened by Saturday’s “senseless act of violence,” and are reaching out to the girls’ families privately. The company said it has started a review of the incident. “Based on theatre associate accounts and video footage, the theatre team jumped into action immediately, calling emergency services and administering aid to the victims,” the statement said. “A visible security presence will be in place at this location for the immediate future.” Saturday’s stabbings came about six weeks after Ravizza attacked his father in their West Tisbury home, according to court filings. Ravizza was charged with assault and battery on a family or household member, and the case was directed to pretrial diversion. His father said Ravissa had suffered a “mental break” and attacked him, according to a police report on file at Edgartown District Court. West Tisbury police took Ravizza to Martha’s Vineyard Hospital for a mental health evaluation, but Ravizza “did not meet their standards to be held,′′ the police report said. The hospital is part of the Mass General Brigham system, and a spokesperson declined to answer questions Monday about Ravizza’s evaluation due to patient privacy laws. Along with the stabbings, Ravizza was sought by law enforcement for “other incidents,” according to the Plymouth district attorney’s office, which did not provide additional details. Advertisement Connecticut State Police said a suspect sought in connection with a fatal stabbing in the town of Deep River had been arrested by Massachusetts authorities Saturday. The agency on Monday declined to provide further details or say on Sunday whether there was a connection between Ravizza and the Connecticut death.

Louis Imhandegbelo has been given kudos for being the first local government council in the state to pay the new minimum wage of N70,000 to workers. The council’s implimentation of the new minimum wage has drawn widespread jubilations across the length and breadth of the local government area. The council workers were seen singing and dancing on Monday at Ubiaja, the council headquarters, praising governor Godwin Obaseki soon after receiving the month of May salaries. Some of them were said to have been dumbfounded on receiving the unexpected bank alerts reflecting the newly established N70,000 minimum wage in Edo State from their various banks. Governor Godwin Obaseki in his speech on May 1st, 2024, to mark this year’s workers day announced N70,000 new minimum wage for Edo State workers which was paid this month by the state government. The development has garnered accolades both within and beyond the borders of Nigeria. The chairman of Esan South East Local Government Council, Louis Imhandegbelo while expressing his gratitude to Governor Godwin Obaseki said, “today, May 27, 2024, my council has paid the new minimum wage to workers and praises should go to God and the governor who believed that the workers were no longer getting things easy since the removal of fuel subsidy by the Federal government”. “As you can see, upon receiving their May salaries, which reflected the new wage structure, the workers are very happy and are jubilating, I asked them to continue to pray for the governor to end his tenure successfully”. Hon. Imhandegbelo however affirmed his commitment to fostering policies that enhance workers satisfaction, promote community development, and bring joy to the people of Esan South East.",

        "content": "The Nigerian Army, on Monday, confirmed the immediate reopening of the popular Abuja Banex Plaza following an understanding between the authorities, plaza management and traders’ association. The plaza had been shut for over a week following a mob attack on some personnel of the Nigerian army by unidentified hoodlums on May 18. This is contained in a statement by the Director, Army Public Relations, Maj.-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, on Monday in Abuja. Mr Nwachucku said a high-level meeting was convened in the Office of the National Security Adviser including the Principal General Staff Officer to the NSA, Commissioner of Police FCT and the FCT Director of the Department of State Services. Others on the panel, according to him are the Leadership and Management of Banex Plaza, a Representative from the Directorate of Abuja Environmental Protection Board, and the National Chairman of the Mobile Phone Traders Association. He said the primary objective of the meeting was to identify and apprehend the perpetrators and ensure the continued security of the Federal Capital Territory. “The following resolutions were agreed upon: Immediate reopening of Banex Plaza to the public and the leadership of Banex Plaza is instructed to lock up Shop C93 with immediate effect. “The owners of the shop who orchestrated the mob attack on the soldiers are to be arrested and handed over to the Nigerian Police. “Market leaders are to remain vigilant and report any remaining perpetrators to the authorities. “Furthermore, the two individuals already arrested have been handed over to the headquarters of the Nigerian Army Corps of Military Police for further action. “The Nigerian army will also thoroughly investigate the circumstances surrounding the presence of its personnel at the plaza and the subsequent attack,” he said. Mr Nwachukwu reiterated that acts of violence against military personnel were not only condemnable but also pose a significant threat to national security and public order. He urged members of the public to exercise caution and restraint when interacting with military personnel and other security operatives, especially when they are in uniform. According to him, there are established channels for reporting grievances or misconduct by personnel to the appropriate authorities. “It is imperative that these channels are utilized to maintain order and respect for those who serve and protect our nation. “The Nigerian army remains committed to ensuring safety and security of all citizens and will continue to work diligently to prevent such incidents in the future,” he added.

        "content": "COMMUTERS can see a refund automatically issued to their account as part of a $450 million benefits package to frequent toll road users. The program is running for the second year in a row and run until early next year. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis brought the state's Toll Relief Program back to reward commuters with SunPass or other state transponders who frequently use toll roads. The Sunshine State is allocating $450 million in funds to reward commuters in hopes of easing the financial burden of commuting. \"That is a way for us to provide relief for folks, given that we’ve been in this inflationary period,\" said DeSantis, quoted by FOX affiliate WTVT . \"You’ve got groceries and all these other things.\" Last year, the program reportedly saved 1.2 million drivers a total of $500 million in toll fees . Each driver then saved around $400 a year, thanks to the program. \"Every little bit helps,\" a driver said on camera. Patty Shay, who told the outlet she crosses over a toll road on an average of four to five times a day, said she'd be excited to see a discount come her way. \"I'd be more than happy to get a reduction on the tolls,\" she said. For Shay, it wasn't just the tolls that made commuting costly. \"The gas adds up,\" she said. \"The tolls add up. I can’t even tell you how much I spend in tolls over a month. It’s quite a lot.\" Therefore, drivers like Shay who cross a toll road more than 35 times per month can expect to see a rebate coming in May. The program starts this week and will run until March 2025. Last year when the program was announced, users had mixed feelings about the parameters for drivers to meet the discount. \"So, someone who drivers through 34 tolls a month is going to purposely go through a toll to get the rebate,\" a viewer of the announcement wrote. Another viewer was thankful for the relief, even if it was small. \"Every little bit helps in today's economy,\" they wrote. \"Thank you, Governor DeSantis!\" Other drivers, though, disagreed with tolls. \"You know what, they need to take the tolls out and just make them straight roads,\" wrote a viewer. Someone else made light of the situation with some backhanded humor. \"Next they're going to make us pay to walk in the parks,\" they said.",

        "content": "The Moroccan Ambassador to Ghana, Her, Excellency Ambassador Imane Ouaadil on 25th May 2024 led the African Group of Ambassadors in Ghana to celebrate this year’s African Union Day. The event also brought together dignitaries and prominent personalities in the country to witness the display and exhibition of the various African tradition, culture, and dishes. Addressing dignitaries and guests at the event, Ambassador Imane Ouaadil said “This year’s celebration acquires particular historical significance –the 61stAnniversary Celebration of the Founding of our continental organization under the theme Educate an African fit for the 21st Century: Building resilient education systems for increased access to inclusive, lifelong, quality, and relevant learning in Africa.” According her Commitment to education has marked the continent’s progress since the 1960s era of independence. “Now more than ever, this resolve must transform Africa into the world’s powerhouse for the 21st century. The AU Year of Education is a unique opportunity to recommit member states to achieving the Continental Strategy for Education in Africa, Agenda 2030 and SDG 4, as well as Agenda 2063. Ambassador Imane Ouaadil emphasized that “If knowledge is power, then education is the key to unlocking that power. Education is now front and center of the development debate – and with good reason. Today, 40% of all Africans are under 15. Another 100 million children will be born here by 2050. Yet, of the 1 million Africans entering the labour market every month, fewer than 25% find a job in the formal economy. This demographic dividend should offer a tremendous opportunity for Africa to build a valuable base of human capital that will serve as the engine for the economic transformation of our continent.” She noted that “The time has never been more auspicious to focus on education, particularly in science, technology and mathematics. The burgeoning youth population of Africa will drive the growth and prosperity of the continent into the next generation, but only if we equip them to do so.” “Allow me use this opportunity to express our profound gratitude and appreciation to the Government of Ghana for celebrating this unique day with us. As the Principal Representatives of our respective countries, it is part of our cardinal responsibilities to promote political, economic, and socio-cultural partnerships that will lead to the realisation of mutual benefits.” She added .",

(AP Photo/Morry Gash) New York Yankees’ Jose Trevino hits a single during the fourth inning of a baseball game against the Houston Astros, Tuesday, May 7, 2024, in New York. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) By KRISTIE RIEKEN (AP Sports Writer) HOUSTON (AP) — When Jose Trevino took a teen leadership class taught by Sherri Davis in high school the New York Yankees catcher couldn’t have imagined the long-lasting impact it would have. “It changed my life,” Trevino told The Associated Press. “She taught me a ton of lessons in high school, life lessons that help to this day.” So, when Davis retired after a 47-year teaching career and started a nonprofit in his hometown of Corpus Christi, Texas, called “ Special Hearts in the Arts ” in 2016 to provide arts education to those with special needs, Trevino quickly became one of the organization’s most important benefactors. This week he’ll give the beloved group another gift to continue its work. Trevino has been selected as the first Most Valuable Philanthropist of the year by the MLBPA Players Trust and is receiving a $5,000 grant for Special Hearts. Trevino was selected for the award over more than a dozen other applicants by a panel of four former players. Amy Hever, the director of the Players Trust, said its focus is to help players create more impact for causes in their communities. “So, this is a way to not only recognize them, but it also raises tremendous awareness for these causes, especially these hyper-local causes and organizations that some would argue are doing the greatest work in their local communities,” Hever said. Davis raved about Trevino’s generosity and the special bond he’s built with the group. Trevino often visits Special Hearts in the offseason and the students rave about meeting him and covet the pictures he’s taken with them. “You’ll never have anyone say anything bad about Jose,” Davis said. “I think he just makes people feel worthy of whatever they do. That’s a Jose thing that he does.” At Special Hearts , students, who range in age from 12-80, take classes in a variety of the arts including dance, theater, music and art. The group performs around the city and has become a favorite of Corpus Christi mayor Paulette M. Guajardo, who invites them to participate in the Fourth of July celebration each year. On Saturday morning, about three dozen Special Hearts performed a sign language version of the song “Love Can Build A Bridge.” Students beamed as they did the number, which they’ve adopted as their theme song. Arts are the focus of the center, but perhaps more important is the confidence participation builds and the community that is forged through the classes. “We don’t say special needs in here,” Davis said. “We say Special Hearts. We never say disabilities. We always say special abilities.” Before each of their performances Davis leads the group in a back-and-forth affirmation. “I always ask them: ‘Who are you?’ And they say: ‘Special Hearts.’ And I say: ‘What do you have? Special abilities?’” Victoria Hinojosa has been a Special Heart for about three years and is the center of the group’s ballet folklorico performances, plays the guitar and takes art classes. When she first joined the group, she told Davis she couldn’t dance because she’s in a wheelchair. “I said: ‘don’t say, I can’t do, say do what you can, how you can,’” Davis said. “And boy, can she swing that skirt.” Hinojosa, who recently began volunteering to help others at the center, can’t overstate the importance of Special Hearts in her life. “I don’t know where I would have been if it wasn’t for Special Hearts,” she said. “It has really made me feel confident in what I do and how I look at things and I love the way I draw now, and it inspires me to do more.” Though he’s often almost 2,000 miles away in New York City, Trevino’s presence is a huge part of Special Hearts. A big photo of him hangs in Davis’ office and posters featuring pictures of him and the students adorn the center. Davis sends him videos of their performances and she recently sent a picture of the group holding a Yankees banner they made with his name on it. “It’s amazing what he’s doing for Special Hearts,” Hinojosa said. “He has really made us all happy, made us really look at ourselves and think we can do whatever we want. We can go out there and perform... and show people what we can do.” Though Davis and the students credit Trevino for his support, he’s quick to point out that the most special heart in the organization is the one belonging to his former teacher. “That’s what it is, it’s her heart,” Trevino said. “Her heart — it’s ginormous. She has a big heart and she’s always looking out for other people.” Idali Duarte Montes, another former student of Davis who now works with her at Special Hearts, agreed. “Without Sherri, of course, this wouldn’t even be here,” she said. “It came completely from her 100%. And all her hard work was what started it. And then everybody, all the love that she exudes and gets from others that want to support and help has brought all that to Special Hearts in the Arts.” Wiliam Rucizka, is another student who is known around Corpus Christi as “Will The Thrill” for his ability to hype up the crowds before performances. Constantly smiling and upbeat, Rucizka enjoys a variety of activities at the center . “We do art, music, theater, dance and ... we do ‘Love Can Build a Bridge’ every day,” he said. “We do celebrating every day.” And because of Trevino’s recent gift, Special Hearts will add a new program. Called “The Remarkables,” the group will dress as superheroes, each with their own special power, and perform at children’s hospitals and nursing homes. Though he’s been out of high school for more than a decade, Trevino still leans on things Davis taught him. An important one is a breathing technique that the Gold and Platinum Glove winner uses to slow things down and “really be in the moment” before games. “It’s really cool what Ms. Davis is doing, and I have a lot of respect for her, and I appreciate everything she’s doing,” Trevino said. “I think anybody who’s around Ms. Davis is lucky because she’s just a great person.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

        "content": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan strongly condemned the Israeli bombardment and targeting of a United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) refugee camp in Rafah in Gaza Strip that resulted in multiple casualties. In a press statement, the foreign office said that targeting individuals who are displaced earlier because of Israeli bombardment and were sheltered in a refugee camp, is yet another breach of international humanitarian law by the Israeli occupation forces. “The attack is also a blatant defiance of the additional provisional measures of 24 May 2024 by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordering Israel to immediately halt its military offensive in Rafah in conformity with its obligations under the Genocide Convention and the worsening humanitarian conditions faced by civilians,” the statement read. It added that with its latest actions, Israeli occupation forces have once again demonstrated their contempt for international law and the basic tenets of decency and acceptable international behaviour. “Pakistan reiterates its demand for immediate and unconditional implementation of the orders of the ICJ of 24 May 2024. Measures must be taken to fully protect civilians in Gaza and the Israeli occupation forces must be held accountable for the Gaza genocide. We call on the UN Security Council to play its role in preventing Israel from any further attacks against the civilians in Rafah and taking effective measures to protect the people of Gaza”, the statement concluded.",

On Monday (May 27), the RM shared the Pennacky-directed clip for “Groin,” which finds the singer and rapper decked out in a dark Adidas track jacket while dancing and rapping in the streets. The three-minute video arrives on the heels of RM’s second solo album, Right Place, Wrong Person , which was released on Friday (May 24), and topped Billboard ‘s latest weekly new music poll featuring artists in various genres of music. Right Place, Wrong Person brings with it 11 new tracks for fans to enjoy amid BTS’ military obligations. Led by the dream single “Come Back to Me,” the album also features the alternative-based songs “Nuts,” “Heaven,” “LOST!” and more. Overall, the project reflects a “raw and honest presentation of RM’s distinctive sensibility, aesthetics, and beliefs,” per a BigHit news release, and follows the South Korean artist’s 2022 debut album, Indigo , which reached No. 3 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. Right Place, Wrong Person includes collaborations with British rapper-singer Little Simz (“Domodachi”) and singer-guitarist Moses Sumney (“Around the World in a Day”). “Come Back to Me” features lyrics by RM, with guest musicians OHHYUK from South Korean band HYUKOH, and guitar and bass from Kuo of Taiwanese band Sunset Rollercoaster, as well as contributions by singer-songwriter JNKYRD and San yawn of Balming Tiger. RM and his BTS bandmates Jin, SUGA, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jung Kook are currently serving in the South Korean military, which mandates an 18-month military enlistment for all able-bodied men by the time they turn 28. A few of the members have pursued various solo projects amid their service, and the full group is planning to reconvene for band activities in 2025. Watch RM’s “Groin” video below.",

        "description": "Larson was trying to run both the Indy 500 and the Coca-Cola 600, but rain delayed the start at Indy and ended the Cup Series races before he could get in the car.",
        "content": "Kyle Larson waves to fans as he leaves the track after the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday. Larson was trying to make it to to the NASCAR Cup Series race in Concord, North Carolina in time to race, but rain prevented that from happening. Darron Cummings/Associated Press CONCORD, N.C. — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only a single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s quest was to complete – if not win – the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday, joining Tony Stewart as the only drivers to do all 1,100 laps in a single day. But then rain intervened not once but twice, and a rookie mistake at the Indy 500 cost him a chance to contend in the one race he ran. “What I thought could be one of the best days of my life quickly turned into one of the most disappointing ones I’ve ever experienced,” Larson said on social media Monday, roughly 12 hours after storms in Charlotte prevented him from climbing into his No. 5 car to finish the NASCAR race. When rain pushed back the start of the Indy 500 by four hours, Larson’s team made the decision to stay and run the race. He made a mistake going through gears at one point, costing him 10 spots, and his pit-road speeding penalty ended any chance of winning. He wound up finishing 18th. The 31-year-old Larson tried to make the best of a bad situation, taking two helicopters and a private jet to reach Concord with the Cup Series race just past the halfway point. The crowd cheered his arrival on pit lane, and Larson donned his race helmet and readied to get into the No. 5 Chevrolet. That’s when the race went under caution, and a steady downpour forced a red flag. Two hours later, NASCAR declared race leader Christopher Bell the winner with 151 laps remaining, saying there was no way to dry the track and resume racing until after 1 a.m. because of the humidity. Larson never took a lap at Charlotte. “So much time, money and effort went into this experience and it just kills me to have it all end the way it did,” Larson said. “I feel like I let so many people down. We knew all along weather could throw a wrench into things but seeing it come to reality is a horrible feeling.” Larson said he was disappointed for car owner Rick Hendrick, apologized to his race team in Indianapolis for his mistakes and expressed frustration for the documentary crew that had followed his eight-month journey but was robbed of a great story by storms in two different states. Larson’s focus now returns to NASCAR and attempting to win his second Cup Series championship. NASCAR rules stipulate a driver can’t participate in the postseason without running every race. That means Hendrick Motorsports will need to file a waiver on behalf of Larson, asking for special permission for the 2021 season champion to race in the playoffs. That hasn’t been done yet, but given the attention Larson brought to the sport over the last few weeks, it is almost unfathomable that the governing body would not grant one. Last year, NASCAR gave Chase Elliott the opportunity to make the playoffs after he was suspended for intentionally wrecking Denny Hamlin in the Coca-Cola 600. Despite rain that washed out much of Indy 500 practice, Larson said attempting “The Double” was one of the best experiences of his life – right up until Sunday. And afterward, Larson expressed his desire to try it again; Hendrick Motorsports and Arrow McLaren have a two-year deal to field a car. “I can’t describe how appreciative I am of everyone’s support of me to live out a dream,” Larson said. “I hope it’s not the last opportunity I have to try ‘The Double’ but if it is I guess it was memorable.” Success.

        "content": "Voting at one of the busiest voting stations in Nelson Mandela Bay proceeded at a snail's pace during the special voting sessions on Monday. At Sherwood NG Kerk, in Gqeberha, the voting station was still packed an hour after the gates closed at 17:00, with close to 200 cars still parked on and outside the premises. For a visibly upset Johan Theron, 59, the \"nightmare\" was too much. \"We spent four-and-a-half hours waiting to vote,\" he said, pointing to his watch. \"This whole process was a nightmare because the people here are pathetic. They don't have their ducks in a row and wasted precious time.\" According to Theron, some voters who arrived when the voting station opened at 09:00 only left around 17:00. He said there were several delays, one of which was a voters' roll not in alphabetical order, leading to a chaotic search for voters' names. \"They tried to search for people's names and went through 79 pages to find it, but were unsuccessful anyway. At one point, the machines were offline, and they just sat there and did nothing.\" READ | Elections 2024: Smooth start to the casting of special votes, says IEC Theron said at 16:00, an hour before the voting station was supposed to close, there were still around 200 people waiting in the queue. \"We registered for special voting, thinking it would go quicker, but not at all. If I had to describe this day in one sentence, I would say it was a waste of time.\" Valerie Theron added: \"We heard that things went better at other voting stations but, at this one, there were too many names on the list that they couldn't find. \"They had three ballot boxes, and only added two more around 14:00.\" For Sonja York, the situation was made worse as her children were waiting for her. She said she had arrived at the voting station around 16:00 and, two hours later, she had still not entered the building. \"I have no choice, but to stay in the queue until my turn because I can't come tomorrow. I'm just worried about how long it will take since my children are at home waiting for me.\" York said she looked forward to voting and having her voice heard, but when it came to \"poor planning\", it did not feel worth it. \"I was at Sunridge [voting station], and it was empty there, but I can't vote there because I live here in Sherwood.\" ROLLING COVERAGE | Elections 2024: Anticipation builds as all stations prep for voters making their mark York said she had parked her car across the road at the shopping complex, thinking she would be back soon. However, she rushed to her car as soon as it became dark otherwise the complex's gate would close, leaving her stranded. \"The long wait was irritating. I have a family and kids at home. I have responsibilities to take care of.\" No party agents were present outside the voting station. News24 was not allowed inside the venue after 17:00. The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) reported a smooth start to the casting of special votes on Monday, despite some glitches resulting in voting stations opening late in parts of the country. The first official day of voting inside the country was marred by isolated protests - in the Eastern Cape and parts of Gauteng - and there were reports of voting stations failing to open, but the IEC indicated that only 0.1% of those casting their votes experienced problems doing so. Special votes continue on Tuesday, ahead of the election day for the rest of the country on Wednesday, with polls opening at 07:00.",

        "content": "SHOPPERS have announced a new list of demands as a grocery store threatens to shut down and leave residents in a food desert. Customers are continuing to protest the closure of a Hy-Vee location in Ceder Rapids, Iowa , following the grocer's announcement that it would be coming up with alternatives to ease the transition. A dozen people were seen protesting the closure, which would leave the town in a food desert. Shoppers were holding signs that said \"You deserted us,\" and \"Boycott Hy-vee\" in front of the Oakland Road location. “By educating our entire community of Cedar Rapids we’re hoping more people will show up for those who are directly impacted by the first avenue Hy-Vee closure,” Angelina Ramirez, the vice president of Advocates for Social for Justice, told local ABC affiliate KCRG. Hyvee announced that its 1st avenue store will be one of three that will be shutting down in Iowa. The announcement has left many residents in the are nervous, as they could possibly become a food desert. This occurs when there are no nearby stores for people to get healthy, fresh food. To help shoppers in the area, Hy-Vee announced that it will be providing a shuttle service from the closed location to the nearest location three days a week until September 1 The location will also continue to offer free pharmacy deliveries and free grocery deliveries to those located within a mile radius from the store. However, protesters are still not happy with the change. They have demanded the store stay open until September, pay the local activist to canvas the surrounding area, and guarantee another grocery store will go into the Hy-vee location. As of now, the grocery store has not commented on the group's recent demands. The store will officially shut down on June 23, and the company has released a statement ahead of the closure. \"No business wants to close a location and that certainly includes Hy-Vee,\" a spokesperson for the company wrote. \"Over the past several weeks, we have listened to community leaders and residents about the impact of our store closures After a meeting with the Mayor, Hy-Vee has announced how it could help the community moving forward. \"Unfortunately, these three stores have each been losing significant amounts of money for several years, and they are simply not feasible for us to operate any longer.” Community leaders have applauded Hy-Vee for how it handled the closure. \"Our meeting with community leaders last week identified priorities to ensure residents can continue to access essential services after the store closes,\" Mayor Tiffany O’Donnell said in a statement \"We brought these concerns to our meeting with Hy-Vee, focusing on things like grocery delivery charges, no-cost pharmaceutical deliveries, and partnerships with transportation providers and local food-access services for additional assistance during the transition. \"It was a positive meeting. We will continue to support efforts to address these challenges and meet our community’s needs.” City Manager Jeff Pomeranz also praised the company for its collaborative efforts. \"They focused on supporting our community members during the transition, and the discussion led to several promising solutions,\" Pomeranz said in a statement. \"Hy-Vee also indicated they are working with the property owner to avoid vacancy after the store’s closure and they will not place any use restrictions on the location, which is a positive sign. \"We are encouraged by their cooperation and hope we can continue working with them to ensure a smooth transition for our residents.”",

        "content": "As a basketball player, he was sublime, until slowed by injuries. But he was an iconoclastic, distinct presence off the court as well, in his broadcasting and activism. The announcement Monday that Bill Walton had died at 71 after a lengthy battle with cancer evidently came as no surprise to the NBA community, but to San Diegans who were unaware of his condition, his death was shocking. The lifelong resident — born in La Mesa in 1952 — has been a part of the community’s fabric since the late 1960s, when he emerged as a basketball prodigy at Helix High School. Walton’s hoops prowess continued at UCLA, where he was an all-time college great who won two NCAA titles. As a lanky, 6-foot-11 20-year-old, he had arguably the greatest championship-winning game ever in 1973 against Memphis State — making 21 of 22 shots, scoring 44 points and posting 13 rebounds and seven blocks. When healthy, his prodigious ways continued in the NBA — with Portland and Boston, where he won one NBA title with each team and was the MVP with the Trail Blazers. In his short prime in his mid-20s, he was an absolutely dominant defensive presence with few historic peers, winning reverential praise from Bill Russell, the greatest defender in NBA history. In 1985-86, after finally mostly recovering from chronic foot injuries, he was arguably the best sixth man ever for an all-time great Celtics team. And until the recent emergence of three-time Denver MVP Nikola Jokić, Walton was considered the greatest passing center of all time. When NBA historian Bill Simmons published his sprawling, encyclopedic “The Book of Basketball” in 2009, it was beyond telling that the closing pages featured Simmons traveling to San Diego to meet with Walton and tell him he was one of a handful of superstar players who understood “the secret” of the sport: that for all the focus on individual greatness, an alchemy generated by collective unselfishness was the key to team success. But Walton was also a vivid presence off the basketball court — as an anti-Vietnam War protester while at UCLA, as a quirky but often riveting TV basketball commentator, as a huge fan of bands only starting with the Grateful Dead, and locally as an activist with strong, sometimes controversial takes on San Diego issues, especially those involving his beloved Balboa Park. Alas, Walton is already being remembered in reductive ways. This was the initial headline on The New York Times’ obituary: “ Bill Walton, one of basketball’s most eccentric characters, dies at 71.” Walton deserved far better than having “eccentric” be the sole adjective in the headline about his death in the most powerful publication in the world. Simmons ends his book on a much more appropriate note: his sadness that Walton’s “mangled feet” had so marred not just his NBA career but his post-NBA life. But he took consolation from the fact that Walton had come to peace with all the what-might-have-beens about his career and learned to live with chronic pain. So should we all. Bill Walton was wonderful, special and unique. We offer our condolences to his family and to all those who were close to him. He was — is — will always be — a San Diegan for the ages.",

Kirton slammed four fours and two sixes in his 39-ball innings. Opener Navneet Dhaliwal contributed 32 runs. Nepal, ranked 17th among T20 teams compared to No. 23 for Canada, won the toss and elected to field at the Grande Prairie Cricket Stadium. Canada finished at 183 for seven in its 20 overs and then dismissed Nepal for 120 with three balls remaining. Dillon Heyliger led the Canadian bowling attack with four wickets while Jeremy Gordon and captain Saad Bin Zafar each took two. Nepal was at 57 for one at one point, before batsmen starting falling in quick succession. The Canadians will open play at the same Texas venue Saturday, facing the co-host U.S. in the opener of the tournament that runs through June 29 in the U.S. and West Indies. Earlier this year, Canada lost a three-match one-day international series 3-0 to Nepal before defeating Nepal A 2-1 in another three-game series. Canada is scheduled to face the 15th-ranked Netherlands in a final warm-up Thursday, also in Dallas. The Canadians have been drawn in Group A with No. 1 India, No. 7 Pakistan, No. 11 Ireland and the 19th-ranked U.S. After the Americans, Canada will meet Ireland on June 7 and Pakistan on June 11, with both games in suburban New York, before wrapping up Group A play against India on June 15 in Lauderhill, Fla. The top two teams in each group move on to the Super Eights, to be played in Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The two top teams from each pool in the Super Eight then move on to the semifinals in Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago on June 26 and 27, respectively. The final will be held June 29 at the Kensington Oval in Barbados. First-round matches in the U.S. will be split between Nassau County International Cricket Stadium (New York), Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium (Dallas) and Broward County Stadium (Lauderhill). West Indies, which hosted the event in 2010, will hold matches at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium (Antigua and Barbuda), Kensington Oval (Barbados), Guyana National Stadium (Guyana), Daren Sammy Cricket Ground (Saint Lucia), Arnos Vale (Saint Vincent and The Grenadines) and Brian Lara Cricket Academy (Trinidad and Tobago). The Canadians qualified for their first T20 World Cup in October, defeating Bermuda by 39 runs to win the four-team ICC Men's T20 World Cup Americas Region Final. Canada and Bermuda both finished with 4-1-0 records with one no-result. But Canada, which lost to Bermuda by 86 runs in its opening match, won the tournament by a superior net run rate (3.98 to 2.41). The Canadians failed to qualify for the eight previous editions of the T20 World Cup, which has expanded to 20 teams in 2024. --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024 The Canadian Press See a typo/mistake?

        "content": "Former Bachelorette Trista Sutter is just fine, but don’t expect to hear the full story about her mysterious absence any time soon. On Saturday, 51-year-old Trista broke her silence about a series of unusual social media posts made by her husband Ryan Sutter earlier this month. Ryan’s posts, which told his followers Trista was away from her family and seemingly not in contact, sparked concern amid admirers of the first-ever Bachelorette couple. “Geez people. Can’t a girl have a nervous breakdown/trial separation/midlife crisis/death/divorce in peace around here?!” Trista wrote on Instagram. Trista made her statement alongside a photo of her, Ryan, 49, and their two children, Maxwell, 16, and Blakesley, 14. “In all seriousness, for those concerned, I’m safe and sound, happy and healthy, in love and grateful,” Trista said. “For those who’d rather focus on being critical and searching way too hard for darkness, good luck with that.” Story continues below advertisement View this post on Instagram A post shared by Trista Sutter (@tristasutter) Without disclosing where she’s been — or why Ryan said she’s been without communication — Trista said an “opportunity for perspective and personal growth presented itself” to her. “With the unconditional support of my family and friends, I chose myself and betterment, knowing that my stay-at-home-mom job and my kids end-of-the-school-year needs were in the best, most capable hands,” she said. Trista said her “stoic husband” Ryan made his cryptic posts out of love for her, so that they would reach her on her “travels.” She told her followers that she and Ryan often use social media “like a digital diary.” Story continues below advertisement “Most of the time, the world doesn’t pay too much attention,” she said. “This time, he couldn’t say anything right and just about every news outlet picked up his ‘cryptic/confusing/attention-seeking/dramatic’ pictures and captions.” The email you need for the day's top news stories from Canada and around the world. However, Trista said Ryan’s posts reached her and gave her the emotional strength to combat “some serious self doubt and fear.” “He doesn’t owe anyone any explanation or require permission to post what he wants to post and share what he wants to share,” Trista said. She assured her followers she would share the rest of the story “in due time.” More on Entertainment ‘General Hospital’ actor Johnny Wactor shot, killed during attempted robbery Live Nation and Ticketmaster lawsuit: Whatever happens won’t cut concert prices Cannes Film Festival: Indie ‘Anora’ wins top honour Palme d’Or Toronto Symphony Orchestra forgoes classics for video game music “After all, nervous breakdowns and separations require much needed rest and relaxation!” she concluded. Trista also shared several Instagram stories of Ryan and their kids lounging on the beach and enjoying a vacation in Mexico. Trista and Ryan married in 2003 after becoming a couple in the inaugural season of The Bachelorette. Ryan’s social media posts beginning earlier this month triggered worry and fascination over the behind-the-scenes lives of the reality stars. In his first of many posts to Instagram, Ryan said his wife’s “absence” has made his heart grow fonder. “I can think of only a handful of days I have not, at minimum, spoken to this incredible woman,” he wrote. “She is the love of my life and my best friend. I cannot imagine loving her any more or any more fondly. But I guess we’re gonna find out.... I miss her already.” Story continues below advertisement View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ryan Sutter (@ryansutter) In one of several followup posts, Ryan said he posted the social media messages for his wife, but they were misconstrued by the general public.

But, to be honest, it also felt good to know people still cared, and worried and wondered.” Story continues below advertisement Ryan joked that he would return to posting only about his dog. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ryan Sutter (@ryansutter) On Saturday, the same day that Trista made her own post, Ryan uploaded a photo of their family and welcomed Trista back. “They say absence makes the heart grow fonder.... We found out it’s true,” he wrote. “It also makes the heart more grateful, more sympathetic, more appreciative for what someone does for you, with you, alongside of you.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ryan Sutter (@ryansutter) Story continues below advertisement Maybe the public will never know what goes on behind the scenes, but at least for now, it’s safe to say there’s little reason for Bachelor Nation fans to fret over the Sutters. 8:57 ‘Bachelor in Paradise Canada’: Winners talk ‘dumpster fire’ Season 2, most surprising moments Curator Recommendations Our results (so far) from a TikTok-viral laser hair removal device 20 Father’s Day gifts to show dad you care",

The city also had a ceremony honoring veterans that afternoon at Powers Park. “It builds pride in our city; it builds pride in our neighborhoods,” first-year Mayor Carmella Mantello said on why they needed to bring it back. “Yes, parades are great, but it’s also what’s behind that parade, and today (it’s a) very very special meaning to really — we hope we do it every day — but to go out of our way to say thank you to all of our veterans.” The parade started at Knickerbacker Park and ran through the streets of Lansingburgh before ending at Powers Park, with residents of all ages on the street to meet them. Though it started to rain as the procession reached Powers Park, the sun managed to stay out for most of the journey. Fire trucks, police cars, sports clubs, and bands made their way, tossing candy, blowing bubbles, and waving American flags as they went. The mostly local groups and schools were also joined by Canadian infantry — the Lincoln and Welland Regiment from the Niagara Region of Ontario. The group has a history with the Veterans of Lansingburgh and attended the Memorial Day Parade for 20 years before its pause prior to the pandemic. The paraders ranged from local politicians and officials to the Ancient Order of Hibernians — joined on their float by Uncle Sam and Betsey Mann — to someone from Joseph’s House & Shelter in a dinosaur costume walking a dog. There was also, of course, a van coated in New York Giants memorabilia down to an inflated player on the back that got some cheers as it went by. “I think we haven’t had any, much exposure down in Lansingburgh, you know, and think it’s just a great opportunity,” said Sidewalk Warriors Troy President Robin Fontanelli about why they and their new refrigerator van were taking to the streets. “It’s really exciting so we wanted to be part of the excitement, The parade at 1 p.m. was just one of the events arranged for the day, starting with a street sign unveiling and ending with a block-party cookout at Forty-One Sports Bar & Grille. The street sign was for Peter Guenette Lane, the street next to Knickerbacker Park dedicated to a fallen soldier who sacrificed his life in Vietnam. A 20-year-old Specialist Fourth Class machine gunner in the Army, Guenette dove on an enemy grenade thrown toward his company while under heavy fire, saving four men. Born in Troy and a Medal of Honor recipient for his act, Mantello said the city was alerted the sign was missing a few months ago, and they unveiled a new one on Monday morning with members of Guenette’s family. “You (hear) the story of Peter, and you know there’s a million stories similar to Peter,” Mantello said. “(Memorial Day) it’s to really take time out of our day to say thank you, to say thank you for our freedom.” A Lansingburgh native, Mantello said she remembers hearing about Guenette and understanding even at her age the weight of a young person giving their life. The parade itself, she said, also brings back memories of watching and being in parades. There is so much pride tied into the day and pride in the city of Troy for themselves, for their city, and for the men and women who have served for them, she said. It brings a feeling of camaraderie and family to Troy. “We’re so proud to bring back Memorial Day, not just the parade but more importantly our veterans ceremony and to really pay respect to the folks who just gave us what we have today,” Mantello said. “We’re proud of our city, we’re proud of our veterans and, you know, today is going to be a great day for Troy.”",

        "content": "The sports world was met with sad news today, May 27: Bill Walton, basketball hall-of-famer and NBA legend, after a battle with cancer. This is a noteworthy loss for the music world, too: If you know two things about Walton aside from his basketball achievements, one is that he had an unceasingly optimistic and offbeat personality. The other is that he was perhaps the world’s biggest (both in terms of enthusiasm and physical size) Grateful Dead fan. Naturally, when — an offshoot band featuring some original Grateful Dead members, , and others — launched nearly a decade ago, Walton was all in. This means Mayer has gotten to know Walton a bit, and back in 2023, he spoke about his experiences with the sports icon. Mayer was Walton’s guest on an interview-style NBA broadcast in January 2023, and he reminisced about Walton speaking to him before taking the stage for a Dead & Company show. It was very Bill Walton. Mayer said, “You know, it’s really just him being very laser-sharp. When Bill gives you advice, he looks you dead in the eye and everything stops, and he speaks with this cadence: ‘Go out there, give it your absolute all. Don’t be shy, they are here to watch you play. Go play to the greatest of your ability.'” \"Some of the greatest compliments I've ever been given were from Bill Walton.\" John Mayer on the advice and support Bill has shared with him over the years. 📲 — NBA (@NBA) Mayer also noted that Walton gave him “some of the greatest compliments I’ve ever been given,” including “some very nice things that sent me on stage with a lot of confidence.” Dead & Company, by the way, is in the midst of . Check out the Mayer/Walton clip above and revisit more of the broadcast below. Basketball fans have also been sharing their favorite clips of Walton, so find some of those .",

        "content": "JAZZ Jennings has shown she's confident in her body as she flaunted her body transformation in new photos. The TLC star posted a couple of snapshots on Instagram of her donning a swimsuit while enjoying the warm weather. In one pic, Jazz, 23, captured an up-close shot of her sporting a plunging black bathing suit while basking in the sunshine. She stared directly at the camera with her long brunette locks flowing down her back. A second pic showed Jazz smiling alongside her friend, Sam, while seemingly at a playground. Sam also rocked a black outfit and her brown hair fell to her shoulders. \"Radiate Love,\" Jazz wrote in her caption before giving a shoutout to her \"best friend.\" \"Oh god u r magnificent,\" one fan commented, while another gushed over her \"beautiful\" appearance. The YouTuber has been regularly flaunting her thinner figure on social media since dropping 70 pounds. Last month, the Florida native showcased her smaller waistline , by sharing a full-body photo of her sporting tiny shorts and a t-shirt. She noted in her caption that she was \"improving every day,\" which fans, including her older brother Sander, praised in the comments. \"Looking amazing! So proud of you for reaching towards your progress goals and continuing to work to be the healthiest and happiest version of you,\" her 26-year-old sibling wrote. The I Am Jazz star has been vocal about her health journey after gaining weight due to binge eating. Jazz previously revealed she packed on more than 100 pounds after turning to food to deal with her depression battle. \"I gained weight and more weight and more weight. And now, almost 100 lbs. heavier, here I am today,\" the TV personality said during a 2021 confessional interview on her show. \"I do experience fat-shaming from my family,\" she admitted, and added that it made her \"feel really humiliated.\" I gained weight and more weight and more weight. And now, almost 100 lbs. heavier, here I am today. Earlier that year, Jazz opened up on Instagram about her \"addiction to food\" and how she would typically \"eat in large quantities.\" The TV star appears to have a much better relationship with her body . In January, she beamed in another Instagram pic that she was \"feeling sexy\" while wearing a revealing black and white top. Shortly before, Jazz confessed to her followers that she was ready to be in a relationship after being single for five years. \"I'm so open to finding love, and I know it'll come,\" she shared after a fan inquired about her love life. \"I'll continue to be patient in the knowing that it'll happen when I'm ready,\" the spokesmodel added. Jazz rose to fame after starring in TLC's reality series, I Am Jazz, which documented her navigating through her teenage years as a transgender female. She also wrote about her experiences in her memoir, Being Jazz: My Life as a (Transgender) Teen, and is an LGBT rights activist.",

        "content": "Love Island is right around the corner and ITV recently confirmed the line-up of gorgeous singletons entering the villa to find that perfect someone. The gorgeous line-up includes 25-year-old retail manager Jessica White. Jess, from Stockport, underwent a fitness transformation two years ago and moments from her journey were shared on social media. She completed a six-month exercise regime with a fitness coach in order to change her lifestyle. In one 'before' picture, Jess rocked light blue leggings and a black sports bra as she tirelessly worked out at the gym. Another photo showed a more recent Jess pouting as she posed for a mirror selfie while rocking an animal print bikini. Her personal trainer shared the snaps on social media at the time. She said: \"6 MONTH TRANSFORMATION BABY. DECEMBER - MAY. Can’t tell you how proud I am of this girl! A few months in Jess was getting irritated that she didn’t get those QUICK results that fad diets often sell you. After her holiday she got straight back on it with her sessions & tracking and it’s all fallen into place. Jess has spent a few years training with a personal trainer ( Image: Instagram/ @kbfiitness) \"Consistency & self discipline is key. Now it’s time to build @jessamywhite forever proud.\" Jess responded to the post: \"Now we build me a [peach emojis] always grateful for you and being there every step of the way.\" Jess and her trainer have been friends for many years, with the trainer constantly sharing videos of the two working out on her page. It comes after it was announced that the new series of the ITV2 show will launch on June 3, with Maya Jama back as the host. It comes following its latest spin-off Love Island : All Stars having aired earlier this year for its debut series. When the line-up was revealed, it showed Jess as a shop manager from Stockport. Jess is a retail manager heading into the Love Island villa ( Image: Instagram/ @kbfiitness) She teased in a post earlier this year that she's \"happiest when in the sun.\" Ahead of walking into the villa next week, Jess shared the reason she signed up to the show. She said: \"All my friends are in relationships, settled down with babies and I’m going to end up that aunt that rocks up at family parties and they say, ‘She's still not met someone, she’s still going to Ibiza having a midlife crisis’. \"I just want to meet somebody and to be able to do all of that stuff too.\" Love Island returns to screens at 9pm on June 3 on ITV2 and ITVX.

        "content": "Peter Obi’s aide, Yunusa Tanko has revealed that the former Anambra governor is not passionate about only getting power. Making this assertion while speaking on Channels Politics Today on Monday, Tanko disclosed that Obi was not interested in a merger that its sole interest was to seek power. Naija News reports that Tanko further disclosed that Obi was more concerned about ensuring that Nigerians are brought out of poverty, amongst other things. Tanko said, “He (Obi) is so passionate about seeing Nigeria work, not passionate about only getting power. “His Excellency Peter Gregory Obi is not interested in a merger that is only for the interest of seeking power; He is interested in a merger that will bring Nigeria out of the poverty level, bringing the Nigerian people to a comfortable state of healthcare, making sure that Nigerians have access to portable drinking water, making sure Nigerians have problems of power supply being solved. He is highly interested strongly on a merger that is driven by ideology and programs but if it is only for the purpose of power he is not interested.” Tanko’s comment comes just as opposition parties are considering merger options as the quest to unseat the ruling All Progressives Congress continues to mount in the build-up to the 2027 general elections.",

        "content": "By STEPHANIE LIECHTENSTEIN (Associated Press) VIENNA — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran’s attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to have economic sanctions imposed over the country’s controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing the program down. The program — as all matters of state in Iran — are under the guidance of Iran’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and that likely won’t change in the wake of last week’s helicopter crash that killed Iran’s president and foreign minister. The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency also comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Israel and Iran have carried out direct strikes on each other’s territory for the first time last month. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said that as of May 11, Iran has 313.2 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 45.4 pounds since the last report by the U.N. watchdog in February . Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. By IAEA’s definition, around 92.5 pounds of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further, to 90%. Also as of May 11, the report says Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 1,3671.5 pounds, which represents an increase of 1,489.8 pounds since the IAEA’s previous report. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi , has previously warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the U.N. agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. Under the original nuclear deal, struck in 2015, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. The 2015 deal saw Tehran agree to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for generating nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At the time, U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. Monday’s report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar IAEA inspectors from further monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.” According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran’s decision to bar inspectors — and a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.” The deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA’s talks with Tehran over improving cooperation, the report acknowledged. Before the May 19 helicopter crash, Iran had agreed to hold technical negotiations with IAEA on May 20, following a visit by Grossi earlier in the month. But those meetings fell apart due to the crash. Iran then sent a letter on May 21, saying its nuclear team wants to continue discussions in Tehran “on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon,” the report said. The report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA’s years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. It said the IAEA’s request need to be resolved, otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations” under a safeguards agreement between Tehran and the nuclear watchdog. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA said that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.”",

        "content": "RALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN) – Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson (R) said Republicans “were right about HB2” as he spoke to supporters at a recent campaign event. Robinson made the comments at a private lunch hosted by RNC National Committeeman Ed Broyhill. Broyhill posted an 18-minute video of . Robinson, who is running for governor, was referring to the controversial House Bill 2, which the Republican-led General Assembly passed in 2016. It required people to use the bathroom that corresponded to their gender at birth and blocked municipalities from passing non-discrimination ordinances. The law sparked national backlash as some companies dropped plans to bring jobs to the state and some major events, such as the NBA All-Star Game, were moved out of North Carolina. A few months after Gov. Roy Cooper (D) was elected in 2016, the legislature partially repealed the law. An found the law cost the state more than $3.76 billion over 12 years in lost business. “We were right about HB2. We told them. You start letting these men go in these bathrooms, the next thing you know. What’s the next step after that? That’s exactly what we said. What’s the next step after that? Guess what the next step was: your daughter losing her scholarship to a biological man in swimming, volleyball, basketball,” Robinson said. “We were right on HB2 and continue to be right on it. The ideas that the left has is a bunch of foolishness. We don’t need to be ashamed to say it.” Robinson’s comments on HB2 came as he was trying to draw a contrast with Democrats, including his opponent in the race Atty. Gen. Josh Stein. Robinson said his campaign would focus on issues like lowering taxes, improving the business climate and education, while he said “the left” would “try to drag him into issues” like House Bill 2. “These folks are coming after you. I say, ‘I’m not worried about them.’ They say, ‘Well, you don’t look worried. Why are you not worried?’ Why in the world should I be worried about what somebody who thinks that there’s 257 genders thinks of me? I don’t care what you think of me. I don’t care,” said Robinson. When asked if Robinson would support reinstating provisions of House Bill 2, campaign spokesperson Mike Lonergan said, “Radical leftists like Joe Biden and Josh Stein want to force women and girls to share restrooms and locker rooms with men. That’s dangerous and extreme. As governor, Mark Robinson will not allow that to happen. It’s just common sense.” Stein campaign spokesperson Morgan Hopkins responded, “Mark Robinson would repeat the failures of HB2: thousands of jobs lost, companies fleeing the state, and billions in losses for North Carolina’s economy. We’ve been down this road before, and it’s a dead end. Josh Stein’s vision for North Carolina is forward-looking and will create a welcoming economic climate for workers and businesses.”",

The Manchester United forward revealed his decision tonight on a post on X, formerly Twitter. The Premier League ace reminded critics that United \"always stick together\". He wrote: \"It's time to come off Socials for a few weeks. \"I plan to rest and reset mentally after a challenging season individually and collectively. \"Thanks to the fans that stood by me through a difficult period. \"To the ones that didn’t just remember at United, we always stick together.\" Fans were quick to comment after the star revealed he was coming off social media. One said: \"Marcus Rashford will come back stronger!\" Another wrote: \"Best thing for him tbh, get his head down and work harder than ever.\" Rashford started the FA Cup final after missing a few games through injury in what was his first start since the semi-final victory over Coventry on April 21. And the Red Devils star played a massive role for his club in a magnificent 2-1 victory over Manchester City at Wembley on Saturday. With United leading 1-0, Rashford pinged a brilliant ball out to Alejandro Garnacho, who picked out Bruno Fernandes to tee up Kobbie Mainoo for the second. Mainoo's goal stunned the Premier League champions before the break with the Red Devils fully deserving to be in front. Jeremy Doku scored a late goal to give City a lifeline but United held on to win Ten Hag a trophy in what could be his final game in charge. As the final whistle rang, Rashford was seen breaking down in tears after a disappointing season ended with silverware. Captain Bruno Fernandes also broke down whilst discussing Erik ten Hag 's future at full-time. Following the win, players and staff celebrated in the dressing room, with footage showing the post-match scenes. In a video shared to the club's official Instagram, Marcus Rashford can be seen smiling and jumping up and down. He also joined team-mate Lisandro Martinez in song to the delight of supporters. The local lad has been linked with an exit this summer but there have been plenty of calls for him to stay. Paris Saint-Germain have previously held interest in the United academy graduate. The forward has been omitted from Gareth Southgate's provisional 33-man Euro 2024 squad. It will give him time to rest and reset ahead of Manchester United's next campaign.",

        "description": "Iran has bolstered its supply of enriched uranium, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog reportedly warned in a confidential report Monday.",
        "content": "Iran has reportedly further built up its supply of enriched uranium , the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog warned in a confidential report Monday. Tehran has about 313.2 pounds of uranium that is enriched up to 60%, marking a 45.4-pound increase since the last report from the International Atomic Energy Agency back in February, the Associated Press reported . Once a nation stockpiles roughly 92.5 pounds of uranium that’s enriched up to 60%, making a nuclear becomes theoretically possible, according to the agency. That is not far away from the weapons-grade level, which generally is pegged around 90% purity. Overall, Iran’s stash of enriched uranium is believed to be around 13,671.5 pounds, up from 1,489.8 pounds in the prior agency report, according to the AP. Iran has long strenuously denied allegations that it is pursuing a nuclear weapon, with top officials citing a supposed fatwa — or ruling in Islamic law — from its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Western experts have long questioned that alleged fatwa and raised concerns that Tehran could have its sights set on becoming a nuclear power. Should Iran obtain a nuclear weapon, it could spark a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, as many Arab nations such as Saudi Arabia have suggested they would scramble to develop one in response. Iran has pushed the envelope when it comes to nuclear development as it suffers under the weight of an onslaught of crippling economic sanctions and the end of a US-backed nuclear deal. The Obama administration reached the deal in 2015, but former President Donald Trump withdrew from the pact in 2018. That deal entailed the easing of sanctions in exchange for Iran setting limits on its nuclear program that would be phased out over time. President Biden’s administration has long been rumored to be eyeing a revival of that deal, but so far, nothing has come to fruition. Instead, relations have been strained amid the Israel-Hamas war. Both Iran and Israel exchanged attacks last month after the US ally allegedly took out a senior Quds Force commander as well as other Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officers during a strike in Syria. Recently, Iran has been reeling from a helicopter crash that killed President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian incident earlier this month. Upon the death of Raisi — who was widely seen as a top contender to succeed Khamenei as supreme leader— Mohammad Mokhber became Iran’s acting president. The death of Raisi paused the agency’s talks with Iran on getting better cooperation, according to the AP account of the most recent report. The watchdog is reportedly still seeking answers about the origins and location of undeclared manmade uranium particles in Iran. Agency officials also claim that no additional progress has been made in trying to install more robust monitoring equipment inside Iran, since they had been taken down in June 2022 . Back in September 2023, Iran prohibited multiple nuclear inspectors. Tehran has yet to reverse that decision. With Post wires",

        "content": "For police, the lowest pay rate for a sworn officer was $75,063 - the lowest level since 2007 compared to CPI. File photo: RNZ By Susan Edmunds Police and teachers are currently being paid their lowest rates compared to the minimum or average wage in at least 20 years. Infometrics economists have crunched the numbers on pay for teachers, nurses and police. Earlier in the year, chief forecaster Gareth Kiernan had noted that MPs were being paid their lowest salary compared to the average wage since the 1970s, before their latest pay increase. The data showed all three sectors' pay was comparatively lower on a range of measures compared to the past, too. \"Compared to historical norms, police pay looks particularly poor, and teachers don't look that good, either,\" Kiernan said. \"Nurses don't appear to be quite so bad, although the recent figures are inflated by the pay equity settlement. If you exclude that from the figures, on the basis that nurses were previously being underpaid because it was a female-dominated profession, then their pay isn't great either.\" For police, the lowest pay rate for a sworn officer was $75,063 - the lowest level since 2007 compared to CPI. Compared to average wages, it was at the lowest point of any time since 2003 and possibly since 1969. It was 41 percent lower than the high point in 1981. Compared to the minimum wage, it was lower than at any time since 2003 and possibly since 1967. It was 63 percent lower than in 1981. Police officers have been involved in a pay dispute but were expected to have a new pay offer confirmed by the end of August. Kiernan said secondary school teachers' income relative to the CPI was the lowest in June last year - just before their latest pay increase - since 2006. The post-primary teachers association (PPTA) said most of its teachers were paid at the top of the pay scale, which was $99,216 a year, going up to $103,085 in December. \"Over the longer-term, teachers' pay has been reasonably stable compared to the CPI, and the pay increase set to come into effect from December this year should push inflation-adjusted pay up to a level that is higher than was seen at any time between December 1986 and June 2020,\" Kiernan said. \"That outcome sounds great for teachers, but if we compare teachers' pay to either the average wage or the minimum wage, it's a different story. In June 2023, teachers' pay relative to either of these variables was at its lowest on record, since 1980. Even with the subsequent pay increases that have occurred and/or will occur in December this year, teachers' pay relative to the average wage or the minimum wage will still be lower than at any time before June 2019.\" He said the teacher pay situation could be leading to wider problems. \"New Zealand's poor educational outcomes and persistently poor productivity results, in combination with pay rates that are continuing to decline relative to other wages and salary, potentially become something of a chicken-and-egg problem. \"One can't expect good educational outcomes without good teachers, but good people won't be attracted to the profession or retained as teachers without good pay either - and primary and secondary education doesn't seem to be an area where investment in capital equipment, automation, or economies of scale are going to make a significant positive impact. Of course, there are other big issues as well such as the curriculum, assessment methods, and the incentives to teach to the median student's ability rather than taking a more tailored approach to student needs.\" Kiernan said before the pay equity boost that started in 2021, nurses' pay was at its lowest level compared to the minimum wage in all of the available data. \"The pay equity boost pushed nurses' pay in 2022 up to its highest level, relative to the average wage, on record. However, relative to the minimum wage, it was only at its highest level since 2016.\" The nurse pay cited was $75,773. \"I wonder whether one of the key aspects of each of these professions is that there is limited scope for improved labour productivity and/or greater capital intensiveness,\" Kiernan said. \"At its simplest, a teacher can only achieve significant 'productivity' improvements by having more students per class; a nurse by having more patients under their care; a police officer by covering a wider area. I can think of how technological advances might have made some of these changes possible - electronic monitoring of patients would require less human supervision of patients in hospital, for example. \"But my impression is that the advances will have been more constrained than across many other occupations, where computers have had a significant effect on people's output over the last 40 years,\" he said. \"As a result, average wages at an economy-wide level might have been able to lift faster because people have been more productive, and the mix of jobs in the economy has also changed towards higher-skilled and higher-paid ones. This trend might have meant that specific occupations with a high human element to them have been left behind a bit, relatively speaking, in terms of their pay rates. \"It's a difficult situation, because as we saw during Covid-19, people seem to implicitly value the human nature of those roles when the going gets tough - but the pay rates don't necessarily reflect that.\"",

        "content": "KUWAIT: Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdullah Al-Yahya on Monday held in-depth discussions with Chinese officials dealing with means of boosting relations in execution of mega development ventures. The minister, according to a statement released by the foreign ministry, received Chinese Ambassador to Kuwait Zhang Jianwei, with the attendance of the head and members of a Chinese government delegation tasked with completing consultation on joint development projects. The meeting with the visiting Chinese officials was held at the ministry headquarters, the official statement said, noting that the two sides explored the close bilateral relations and strategic cooperation between Kuwait and China, where they also broached “frameworks of boosting and promoting the relations in various sectors and at diverse levels”. The two sides held in-depth discussions, focusing on the necessity to cement technical, development and economic ties in the realm of executing mega development projects in Kuwait. Moreover, they addressed the need to offer proposals and the aspired perceptions for attaining aspirations of the supreme political leadership to press ahead with laying the foundations of a future plan to launch common strategic ventures, namely Mubarak Al-Kabeer Port. — KUNA China will host a number of other Arab leaders in Beijing this week, its foreign ministry said Monday. The leaders will from Tuesday to Saturday “pay state visits to China and attend the opening ceremony of the 10th Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum”, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement. Among the delegation will be Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, Tunisian President Kais Saied and the United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan. Speaking at a press conference in Beijing, Vice Foreign Minister Deng Li said President Xi Jinping would attend the forum and deliver a keynote address on Thursday. Xi would also “hold talks with the four heads of state respectively to exchange views on bilateral relations and regional and international issues of common concern”, Deng said. The forum would aim to deepen “consensus between China and Arab countries”, Deng said, and would be co-chaired by top diplomat Wang Yi and his Mauritanian counterpart. They would also “issue a common voice between China and Arab countries on the Palestinian issue”, he said. China has sought to build closer ties with Arab states in recent years, and last year brokered a detente between Tehran and its long-time foe Saudi Arabia. The meeting with Arab leaders in Beijing comes as China seeks to position itself as a mediator in the conflict between the Palestinian group Hamas and the Zionist entity. China has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Zionist-Palestinian conflict. And Xi has called for an “international peace conference” to resolve the fighting. – Agencies",

        "description": "They were the headline picks for NZ's Olympics sailing team. But a secret selection policy suggests the pair weren't eligible.",
        "content": ", Sports Correspondent YachtingNZ is accused of mishandling its Olympic selections afterone of its star crews was picked for the Paris Games,despite failing to meet the required performancestandard. Jo Aleh and Molly Meech, who paired up inthe 49erFX class at the beginning of 2022, headlined theannouncement of the New Zealand sailing team for the Gameslast month. With five previous Games appearances and threeOlympic medals between them, the pair are the mostexperienced of the . But according to YachtingNZ's selection documents, the duo were not eligible to beconsidered for nomination, having failed to achieve a top 10placing at one of the designated selection regattas. Theselection was signed off by the New Zealand OlympicCommittee (NZOC). Both organisations are adamantproper process was followed in the nomination and selectionof the pair. However, Yachting NZ's apparentwillingness to contort its criteria for Aleh and Meech,along with a perceived inconsistent application of the\"emerging talent\" clause, has led to several disputes overits handling of selections and allegations ofbias. Yachting NZ has long maintained a cloak ofsecrecy around how it selects its athletes for the OlympicGames. It is the only national body that does not publiclyshare its nomination criteria - contravening the NZOC'snomination and selection regulation - and sailors wishing tobe considered for the pinnacle event must agree to keep itconfidential. However, RNZ has obtained a copy of theselection documents. New Zealand's sailors must clearan even higher bar than the NZOC's already lofty \"top 16\"criteria to be nominated for selection. Under its primaryselection criteria, Yachting NZ selectors will only nominateathletes deemed capable of winning a medal. To beeligible, sailors and crews must have, as a baseline,achieved a top 10 placing in at least one selection regatta,or have medalled at a world championships during thatOlympic cycle. There is a second pathway for sailorsor crews that Yachting NZ selectors consider to be \"emergingtalent\" and have the potential to medal at the next Olympicsin Los Angeles in 2028. Under these criteria, sailors needto finish in the top 16 nations at one of the selectionregattas to be eligible. Aleh and former sailingpartner Polly Powrie, affectionately known as Team Jolly,won gold in the women's 470 in London and silver inRio. Meech was also , alongside teammate Alex Maloneyin the 49erFX class. The popular duo went their separateways following a disappointing 12th place finish inTokyo. Meech then linked up with Aleh at the beginningof 2022 to form Team Jolly 2.0. Despite theircredentials, the new pairing have produced mixed results onthe international circuit. In the first of twoselection regattas, Aleh and Meech placed 34th at theEuropean Championships in Portugal last year - well outsidethe top 10 benchmark - before recording a 12th at the WorldChampionships earlier this year. Prior to being namedin the Games team last month, the duo had recorded just onetop 10 result at a major international regatta intwo-and-a-half seasons - a . It isunderstood selectors relied heavily on this result, despiteit not being an official selection regatta. Under thecriteria, selectors can also consider \"a sailor or crew'strack record of success at past Olympic Games\". However,those familiar with the policy say these factors only comeinto play in final deliberations once sailors have met theunderlying eligibility criteria. RNZ has spoken withseveral past and present members of the NZL sailing team,who expressed concern about Yachting NZ's handling of thisyear's selections. None wanted to go on the record for fearof being seen to diminish Aleh and Meech. All made apoint of saying they would not have wanted to see the 49erFXpair left out of the Olympic team, but a recurring theme ofthe conversations was that Yachting NZ's perceivedinconsistent approach to its selections has created distrustin the system. Aleh did not want to be drawn into thedebate over the merits of her inclusion in the team, buttold RNZ via text message that she is \"very pro-selection,having had close friends impacted by selection policies inthe past\". \"In terms of the YNZ policy we were happyto be selected and for us it was just a little step on theway to what we are trying to do in Paris. So our focus isvery much on making sure we are doing everything we can overthe next few months,\" she wrote. Since being named inthe Olympic team, Aleh and Meech had a breakthrough resultlast month at French Olympic Week in Hyeres, claiming thebronze medal - a promising sign the pair are beginning toperfect their partnership. But it is clear on anyone'sreading of the criteria that Yachting NZ have applied anextraordinary amount of discretion to include Aleh and Meechin the team. In a brief statement provided to RNZ,Yachting NZ boss David Abercrombie said the organisationdoes not publicly comment on individual nominations, but allsailors and crews were selected in line with its policies.The nomination of athletes \"follows a rigorous process ledby an independent panel with a wealth of sailing expertiseand experience\". NZOC secretary general Nicki Nicolalso asserted proper process was followed. \"Allselections are made by an experienced selection panel.Decisions are evidence based and athletes nominated by[national sports organisations] are assessed by the NZOCselectors against the agreed nomination criteria and theNZOC selection policy,\" she said in astatement. The discretion used to pick Aleh and Meechappears not to have been as readily available toothers. RNZ understands at least one sailor -kitefoiler Lukas Walton-Keim - has lodged a formal appealwith the Sports Tribunal over his non-nomination in the newOlympic class. Walton-Keim is the partner of Olympicpole vaulter Eliza McCartney, who last weekend spoke outabout the NZOC's controversial \"top 16\" selection policy,arguing qualified athletes should not be denied entry to theOlympics. It is understood Walton-Keim's case will beheard this week, unless a resolution can be reached in themeantime. All parties agree to confidentiality when acase is before the tribunal, but it is understoodWalton-Keim is seeking nomination under the \"emergingtalent\" clause. Two athletes have been selected underthis criteria - boardsailor Veerle ten Have in the women'sIQ foil, and Greta Pilkington, who is expected to beconfirmed in Ilca 6 at an official announcement on Tuesdaymorning. Ten Have finished 22nd and 21st overall ather two selection events, but was easily inside the top 16nations for both events. Pilkington had a shaky startto her campaign, recording 53rd and 44th placings in thefirst two selection events earlier this year, before pullingit out of the bag in the final event in Hyeres last month.There the 20 year-old finished 16th, and 14thnation. It is expected Walton-Keim's case will focuson the inconsistent application of the \"emerging talent\"clause. Walton-Keim finished 28th, 17th, and 27th athis three selection regattas. His 17th placing at theEuropean Championships last year put him inside the top 16nations. While not official selection regattas, the 28year-old is also tracking strongly at recent events. Hefinished 11th at French Olympic Week in Hyeres, or ninthnation, and 17th at the Formula Kite world championships(15th nation) earlier this week. Following the event,Walton-Keim posted on Instagram: \"I'm not sure what's next,I'd like to do some more racing in 2024 ... let'ssee.\" One former international sailor said thegoverning body's flexibility is at odds with its \"rigid\"approach in the past to not only Olympic nomination, butalso funding decisions and selection to its \"Fast Track\"development programme. \"YNZ will follow the rules tothe absolute letter when it suits them. We're always beingtold, 'Well, the policy is very clear,' but then when theywant to get someone in the team, suddenly there is all thisgrey area,\" they said. Abercrombie did not directlyaddress questions related to whether he has concerns aboutperceptions of bias and growing distrust in the system. Butin a statement, he said Yachting NZ's policies are\"transparent and available to every athlete throughout theircampaigns\". The long-serving chief executive of theorganisation also said the current policy was \"developedafter an athlete-led review following the Tokyo OlympicGames\" and athletes will continue to be involved in refiningthe policy for future cycles. Nicol also ignoredquestions about whether the NZOC had any concerns aboutYachting NZ's handling of selections. \"While we arenot able to comment on individual cases, we do understandhow tough it is for athletes that may not have beennominated by their sport for selection to an NZTeam.\" It is not the first time questions have beenraised about Yachting NZ's approach to selections forpinnacle events. In 2016 Sara Winther (laser radial) andNatalia Kosinska (RS:X) over their non-nominationfor the Rio Games. While the tribunal ultimately ruledin favour of Yachting NZ, the then-chair of the arbitrationbody Sir Bruce Robertson was highly critical of the sport'shandling of selections. \"I have concerns about theinadequacy of communication by YNZ to both athletes. Whilethe selection policy is drafted to provide huge discretionto YNZ, this does not obviate its obligations to abide bythe rules of natural justice and to ensure basic fairness inits implementation,\" Sir Bruce wrote in hisdecision.",

        "description": "Sue Bird can relate to Caitlin Clark’s losing predicament, coming off a UConn career where she won two NCAA titles and only lost four games in college. Both were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft 22 years apart, landing on last-place teams.",
        "content": "NEW YORK — Sue Bird can relate to Caitlin Clark’s early frustrations about losing in the WNBA. But the former UConn women’s basketball all-time great knows from experience how things could change for the much-talked about rookie. Now 43, Bird came out of UConn where she won two NCAA titles and only lost four games. Clark led her Iowa team to consecutive NCAA Championship games while becoming the NCAA Division I career scoring leader. Both were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft — 22 years apart — and landed on last-place teams. Clark’s Indiana Fever have just one win in their first seven games. Bird, who eventually won four WNBA titles with Seattle, recommends patience for Clark. She recently watched courtside when New York beat Clark and Indiana before more than 17,000 fans at the Barclays Center. Now a part-owner of the Storm, Bird joins Lisa Leslie (LA Sparks) and Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream) as former WNBA players turned owners. Bird thinks more lucrative broadcast rights contracts and an improved collective bargaining agreement will “dramatically” change the WNBA landscape in the next few years. That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster. Clark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro. However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000. The NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick Victor Wembanyama earned $12.1 million in his rookie season. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State’s Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year. Bird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women’s Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity: Ways the WNBA can grow: Larger rosters, more teams, a G League? Bird: If I’m being honest, we’ve done our part (as players). The product on the floor has never been better. Now it’s the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you’re going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there’s a soft cap — now we’re talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year — so by 2026, it could be dramatically different. What about the expense argument against a WNBA G League? Bird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don’t have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas. Talk about the impact of NIL and how it elevates the brand of athletes? Bird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out — the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it’s just growing pains. I’m sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world — the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There’s a popularity and you’re connecting with a brand. There’s no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way. You’ve done TV commentary with Diana Taurasi, but what’s been the most fun about your post-basketball career? Bird: Just being able to do what I want. It’s nice to not have to worry that I have to eat by 4 p.m. because my game is at 7 p.m. They see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and that’s exactly what we’d be doing if we were at home with no cameras.

        "description": "Love Island star Ekin-Su Culculoglu was one of the stars taking part in ITV's 2024 season of Celebrity Big Brother - but things did not turn out well for her during her time on the show",
        "content": "Ekin-Su Culculoglu has addressed the fact she failed to turn up to the grand final of ITV ’s revived Celebrity Big Brother earlier this year. The 29-year-old Love Island star was one of the 13 celebrities that entered the Most Famous House In Britain in March and she had high hopes of being able to show a new side of herself to fans. Plans backfired somewhat, however, as Ekin-Su sparked bitter arguments in the house, appeared obsessed with not being recognised for her Love Island fame, and clashed with show hosts AJ Odudu and Will Best after she was voted out of the house as she tried to blame producer’s editing the show to make her look bad. Now Ekin-Su has opened up about her disastrous turn on the series and says she couldn’t make it to the live final as she was struggling to cope with bombshell news that ex-boyfriend Davide Sanclimenti, 29, had cheated on her. The British-Turkish actress has conceded that her time in the house was nothing short of a disaster, but has rejected the suggestion that this was the reason behind her finale no-show. In the last episode of the season, where Ibiza Weekender star David Potts , 31, was crowned winner, former housemates were invited to return to review their time on the show. Businessman Gary Goldsmith was also absent from the finale, but there is speculation his decision to not appear was down to his niece, Catherine, Princess of Wales , battling cancer. Ekin-Su's time on the reality show was tarred by bitter arguments ( Image: ITV1) Virgin Media offers gamers the chance to get £250 but you'll need to act quickly Speaking to The Sun, Ekin-Su said: “I should never have gone into the Big Brother house. I was angry, hurt, maybe a bit bitter, definitely insecure – Big Brother is not where you go to heal heartache, let me tell you. I went into the show thinking that I could rebuild myself after everything that happened with Davide, but I came off worse. My guard was up.” She continued: “I blame myself for making a poor choice in my career. People could see that I wasn’t myself, and I can understand why they thought I was being fake.” And she added: “I never wanted to believe the allegations against Davide but people would tell me I was being cheated on all the time. I was so scared of being alone, and I didn’t know who the hell Ekin-Su was meant to be without him.” Cheating accusations have ruined the once strong romance on both sides. As fans will already be aware, Ekin-Su and Davide won the eighth season Love Island in 2022 and their romance flourished outside of the house. However, their relationship turned sour after 11 months and they broke up. Davide has accused Ekin-Su of cheating on him with a fellow contestant on the USA version of The Traitors which sees celebrities taking on tasks and trying to avoid betrayal. It has been alleged that Ekin-Su developed a romance with The Bachelorette star Peter Weber on the show - an accusation she has fiercely rejected. Hitting out at the suggestion on Monday, Ekin-Su said: “It’s absolutely not true. I made friends with a lot of people I was with on Traitors. I’ve always been a faithful to Davide.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads.",

        "content": "By Curtis Williams HOUSTON (Reuters) - Trinidad and Tobago received six bids from BP, Shell and US shale producer EOG Resources on four blocks to explore for oil and gas as its 2023 shallow water auction closed on Monday. Trinidad plans to announce the winners in four months, Energy Minister Stuart Young said at the closing of the auction. All three companies bid for the Modified UC block, which is close to the Teak, Sammaan, Poui producing fields. The auction had no other bidders. Trinidad is Latin America's largest producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), with installed capacity of 15 million metric tons per year of the super-cooled gas. It also is one of the world's biggest exporters of methanol and ammonia, but its plants have been operating below full capacity in recent years due to a lack of gas. In October 2023 the Trinidad government put out 13 blocks for bids. Monday's results mean that nine of the 13 blocks did not receive any interest and all the bids were from companies already operating on the Caribbean island. EOG Resources bid on three blocks, the Modified UC; the Lower Reverse L, which is west of Shell's Manatee discovery and on the border with neighboring Venezuela; and NCMA 4, in an area operated by Shell. Shell had one bid on Modified UC while BP, which bid on Modified UC also placed a bid for NCMA 2 which is north of Trinidad and not in the Columbus basin where the company has operated since the 1970s. Trinidad made several changes to the fiscal terms to attract more bids after the failure of its 2019 bid round, including reducing the tax liability for shallow-water producers, raising cost recovery to 60% from 50%, cutting the windfall tax to 50% from 70%, increasing the exploration period to eight years from six years and lowering the bid fee to $30,000 from $40,000.

        "description": "The federal government has been heavily criticised by the domestic, sexual and family violence response sector following its budget. Today its \"rapid review\" of how to best prevent violence against women will begin in Sydney.",
        "content": "The federal government's \"rapid review\" of how to best prevent violence against women will begin today in Sydney before its advice is delivered later this year. The review signals a potential shift in direction for the government, with its panel including strong critics of current prevention strategies. The Albanese government has been following the federal budget, which was described by frontline workers as \"trickery and deception\". The \"rapid review\" will cost $1.3 million over two years and will be led by Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence Commissioner Micaela Cronin, director of the Commonwealth Office for Women Padma Raman, and secretary of the Department of Social Services Ray Griggs. The panel's report is due between July and September, though a specific date has not yet been set. Why is the government establishing another review? Advocates, frontline workers and peak bodies have said they have reached saturation point on consultation on what governments must do to prevent and respond to violence against women and children. They have called for urgent, ongoing funding for services, and for recommendations from previous reviews to be followed through. Earlier this month, Minister for Women and Finance Katy Gallagher told the ABC the government wanted to bring together experts in prevention to ensure the government response was as effective as possible. \"There are a range of views, there are new papers that come out all the time on this,\" she said. \"That's why we want to, as [the] commonwealth, pull together all the work and all the people involved in this space and get agreement on what are the things that are going to work in shifting the dial. \"And also making it not a women's issue but an issue where we focus on the perpetrators of that violence.\" Who will be involved? An expert panel, which will include journalist and critic of current prevention strategies Jess Hill, will conduct the review alongside Ms Cronin, Ms Raman and Mr Griggs. Sexual assault support services: In a recent paper in collaboration with Michael Salter, Hill highlighted that across multiple metrics the current approach to prevention — focusing very heavily on increasing gender equality — had \"It has achieved only marginal improvements to community attitudes over the past decade,\" they said. \"We may be world leaders in funding and developing primary prevention – and that is certainly laudable — but we are not world leaders in actually preventing violence. \"We are not suggesting that the gendered violence sector abandon the project of gender equality as an important goal, but we do dispute a disproportionate focus on 'gendered drivers' of violence, both in analysis of the problem and the parameters of the prevention response.\" Also on the panel are: People working at every level of the gendered violence crisis say they have got the answers to help stop this scourge but they need governments to walk the walk, not just talk the talk. The group will consult with the states and territories, the national violence prevention organisation Our Watch, Australia's National Research Organisation for Women's Safety (ANROWS) and the National Women's Safety Alliance. A series of roundtables will also be part of the process. They will include members of the steering committee for the First Nations National Plan (to end violence against Indigenous women and children), those with lived experience of violence and frontline service workers. ANROWS has also been asked by the federal government to assess existing research to look at the most effective ways to prevent violence against women and children. The review follows recent crisis talks convened by the commissioner which examined how to stop men killing women, as well as a national cabinet meeting on the issue. It is unclear how many times the panel will meet before it delivers its report later this year. Government spending met with criticism The review comes amid criticism of the federal government's response to violence against women. More than half of those who have previously applied for the payment have either been declined or failed to complete the process. Earlier this month, the federal government announced the escaping violence payment would become permanent, which violence response organisations said was a good start but \" if not expanded. The federal government has the conditions of the payment, which only applies to those fleeing a violent partner but not a family member or carer. Women with disabilities have warned that despite being particularly vulnerable to violence, they by the government's plan, with ministers saying they But Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Social Services Minister Amanda Rishworth have defended the government's record on the issue, to combat the problem since Labor came to government in 2022.",

        "content": "Prince William and Prince Harry, who used to enjoy very strong bond in the past, are said to be at loggerheads since the Duke said the royal family goodbye to enjoy a new life with his wife Meghan Markle and their children in the US. The Duke of Sussex was over the moon when Meghan was pregnant with their first child, Prince Archie, and couldn't wait to share the news with his brother William and sister-in-law Kate Middleton. William's reaction to Harry's delightful announcement has been revealed by the Duke himself, saying the future King had just four words to say when he told him Meghan was pregnant. Harry, in his memoir Spare, recalled William's response to his happy news and said he smiled and uttered just four words: \"We must tell Kate.\" Harry also detailed Kate Middleton's reaction and said she was overjoyed to hear the news. \"She also gave a big smile and hearty congratulations. They both reacted exactly as I hoped - as I'd wished,\" wrote Harry. He also mentioned how King Charles reacted: \"Just before a drink reception for the bride and groom, we cornered Pa in his study. He was delighted to learn that he was going to be a grandfather for a fourth time; his wide smile warmed me.\" Meghan Markle gave birth to Prince Archie on May 6, 2019 at the Portland Hospital, London. The couple have since gone on to welcome a second child, Princess Lilibet, who was born at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in California, on June 4, 2021.",

        "content": "Freaks, sickos, and perverts the world over breathed a sigh of relief when it was announced in October 2022 that John Waters would be adapting his novel . For one thing, the film would be his first since 2004's Then, it was later revealed that Aubrey Plaza wanted to star in the film, and Waters wanted her to do it, too. It seemed almost too good to be true. And it turns out, maybe it was. In an interview published today , Waters fielded a single question about , and the answer is, frankly, saddening. “Every time I comment on that, some article comes out that causes me , saying we’re making the movie,” Waters says. In short, Roadhouse Pictures optioned a script from him, and he wrote one. “Aubrey [Plaza] likes the script, wants to be in it, I want her to be in it, and every person said, ‘No, we don’t have a penny of the budget.’ That is where it is today. Hopefully that will change. But the answer as of today? That’s it. In short, there has been no actual movement.” Disappointing, but not wholly surprising. For the financially minded, a John Waters flick is hardly a safe return on investment; in the same interview, he mentions how , his 1990 Johnny Depp-led film and one of his more mainstream, has never turned a profit. Beyond that, even a director like Francis Ford Coppola, a man with five Oscars and the director of two films often considered among the greatest of all time, sold his Granted, some elements of that film sound downright Waters-esque, but if a director as established in the mainstream as Coppola is having these issues, it’s no surprise that Waters is, too. If there is a piece of better news from the interview, though, it’s that Waters has ideas for the . “Not a sequel. But there’s been talk of it being a TV show,” Waters says, “which I think would work best, because if it built to a kill once a month... And with political correctness being what it is, it’s perfect! She’d just kill for political correctness!” He goes on to call his “best movie,” in part because of Kathleen Turner and a nice healthy budget. Hopefully, we get to see what happens with Aubrey Plaza and a nice healthy budget.",

Council chiefs face having to repay up to £1.2million in LEZ penalties after a judge ruled they should have been sent by recorded delivery. 2 Drivers may be able to claim back LEZ fines Credit: Alamy 2 Council chiefs face having to repay up to £1.2million in LEZ penalties Credit: Alamy Lord Lake’s verdict last week upheld a decision in favour of Allan Hamilton, from Ayrshire . The motorist took the authority to a tribunal, insisting his £60 fine was invalid because it had been sent by standard mail. After a law chief backed his claim last October, council officials began sending out their penalty notices by tracked post. But the blunder means at least 20,000 fines issued from the start of the scheme last June until November could be challenged. READ MORE LEZ LEZ OF THAT Over 1 MILLION cars to be banned from Scots roads in weeks under hated new laws GRIDLOCKED Hundreds of drivers use our street as car park to avoid LEZ fines - it's a mess Mr Hamilton claimed legal protocol was not followed when he was fined for driving his van into the city. First-tier tribunal adjudicator Alexander Green agreed a record of delivery was a “mandatory requirement”. The council appealed to the Upper Tribunal for Scotland. But Lord Lake told them the service of notices must be “verifiable”. LEZ rules punish drivers of vehicles that don’t meet strict emissions rules with fines rising from £60 to a maximum of £480.

Locals slam 'idiot' quad biker after shocking near miss on Scots roundabout WHEEL DEAL Car expert reveals 3 used luxury motors to buy for under £10k including Maserati A Glasgow council spokesman said: “Since November all LEZ penalty charge notices have been issued by tracked delivery.” It comes after we revealed that Glasgow's pollution is now WORSE despite the introduction of the widely-hated LEZ. Glasgow city centres Low Emission Zone explained New data has revealed that Glasgow City Council's aim for the LEZ was to reduce emissions by cutting down on vehicles that omit a key pollutant nitrogen dioxide (NO2) into the atmosphere. But fresh stats have shown emissions have actually INCREASED since controversial green-scheme was introduced in June 2023 to prevent older and more polluting motors from entering the city centre. The new data shows how the NO2 level at a key monitoring station for Glasgow has risen in the first quarter of the year compared with the same period - before the LEZ was introduced. CAB FEARS WE told last month how hundreds of black cabs could be forced off the road in a matter of weeks over the LEZ rules. Scottish Tory transport spokesperson Graham Simpson said : \"Nearly a year on from the roll-out of the SNP-Greens' shambolic LEZ, it is clear it is not even meeting its main objective to improve air quailty.\" A Glasgow City Council spokesperson said: \"Levels of air pollution , in particular nitrogen dioxide and particulates, are influenced by a number of factors, including weather patterns. \"The LEZ's initial impact will be assessed as part of a statutory annual progress report later this year, with detailed analysis from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.\" Across January, February and March on Glasgow’s Hope Street the NO2 levels were 44.2 microgrammes per cubic metre, up from 42.5 for the same period in 2023, reports the Mail on Sunday . Another monitoring station near a school in Anderston, on the edge of the LEZ, shows NO2 up by 35 per cent, sparking fears that pollution is simply being \"displaced\" to around the car ban area. These concerns were made in the local authority's own reports ahead of the introduction of the zone.",

According to reports, the 57-year-old was flying from Miami to Los Angeles when he became unwell and appeals were made to find passengers with medical experience to provide assistance. Paramedics then came on board after the plane landed, delaying passengers from disembarking for around 25 minutes.

(AP Photo/Adam Hunger) HOUSTON (AP) — When Jose Trevino took a teen leadership class taught by Sherri Davis in high school the New York Yankees catcher couldn’t have imagined the long-lasting impact it would have. “It changed my life,” Trevino told The Associated Press. “She taught me a ton of lessons in high school, life lessons that help to this day.” So, when Davis retired after a 47-year teaching career and started a nonprofit in his hometown of Corpus Christi, Texas, called “ Special Hearts in the Arts ” in 2016 to provide arts education to those with special needs, Trevino quickly became one of the organization’s most important benefactors. This week he’ll give the beloved group another gift to continue its work. Trevino has been selected as the first Most Valuable Philanthropist of the year by the MLBPA Players Trust and is receiving a $5,000 grant for Special Hearts. Trevino was selected for the award over more than a dozen other applicants by a panel of four former players. Amy Hever, the director of the Players Trust, said its focus is to help players create more impact for causes in their communities. “So, this is a way to not only recognize them, but it also raises tremendous awareness for these causes, especially these hyper-local causes and organizations that some would argue are doing the greatest work in their local communities,” Hever said. Davis raved about Trevino’s generosity and the special bond he’s built with the group. Trevino often visits Special Hearts in the offseason and the students rave about meeting him and covet the pictures he’s taken with them. \"You’ll never have anyone say anything bad about Jose,” Davis said. “I think he just makes people feel worthy of whatever they do. That’s a Jose thing that he does.\" At Special Hearts , students, who range in age from 12-80, take classes in a variety of the arts including dance, theater, music and art. The group performs around the city and has become a favorite of Corpus Christi mayor Paulette M. Guajardo, who invites them to participate in the Fourth of July celebration each year. On Saturday morning, about three dozen Special Hearts performed a sign language version of the song “Love Can Build A Bridge.” Students beamed as they did the number, which they’ve adopted as their theme song. Arts are the focus of the center, but perhaps more important is the confidence participation builds and the community that is forged through the classes. “We don’t say special needs in here,” Davis said. “We say Special Hearts. We never say disabilities. We always say special abilities.” Before each of their performances Davis leads the group in a back-and-forth affirmation. “I always ask them: ‘Who are you?’ And they say: ‘Special Hearts.’ And I say: ‘What do you have? Special abilities?’” Victoria Hinojosa has been a Special Heart for about three years and is the center of the group’s ballet folklorico performances, plays the guitar and takes art classes. When she first joined the group, she told Davis she couldn’t dance because she’s in a wheelchair. “I said: ‘don’t say, I can’t do, say do what you can, how you can,’” Davis said. “And boy, can she swing that skirt.” Hinojosa, who recently began volunteering to help others at the center, can’t overstate the importance of Special Hearts in her life. “I don’t know where I would have been if it wasn’t for Special Hearts,” she said. “It has really made me feel confident in what I do and how I look at things and I love the way I draw now, and it inspires me to do more.” Though he’s often almost 2,000 miles away in New York City, Trevino’s presence is a huge part of Special Hearts. A big photo of him hangs in Davis’ office and posters featuring pictures of him and the students adorn the center. Davis sends him videos of their performances and she recently sent a picture of the group holding a Yankees banner they made with his name on it. “It’s amazing what he’s doing for Special Hearts,” Hinojosa said. “He has really made us all happy, made us really look at ourselves and think we can do whatever we want. We can go out there and perform... and show people what we can do.” Though Davis and the students credit Trevino for his support, he’s quick to point out that the most special heart in the organization is the one belonging to his former teacher. “That’s what it is, it’s her heart,” Trevino said. “Her heart — it’s ginormous. She has a big heart and she’s always looking out for other people.” Idali Duarte Montes, another former student of Davis who now works with her at Special Hearts, agreed. “Without Sherri, of course, this wouldn’t even be here,” she said. “It came completely from her 100%. And all her hard work was what started it. And then everybody, all the love that she exudes and gets from others that want to support and help has brought all that to Special Hearts in the Arts.” Wiliam Rucizka, is another student who is known around Corpus Christi as “Will The Thrill” for his ability to hype up the crowds before performances. Constantly smiling and upbeat, Rucizka enjoys a variety of activities at the center . “We do art, music, theater, dance and ... we do ‘Love Can Build a Bridge’ every day,” he said. “We do celebrating every day.” And because of Trevino’s recent gift, Special Hearts will add a new program. Called “The Remarkables,” the group will dress as superheroes, each with their own special power, and perform at children’s hospitals and nursing homes. Though he’s been out of high school for more than a decade, Trevino still leans on things Davis taught him. An important one is a breathing technique that the Gold and Platinum Glove winner uses to slow things down and “really be in the moment” before games. “It’s really cool what Ms. Davis is doing, and I have a lot of respect for her, and I appreciate everything she’s doing,” Trevino said. “I think anybody who’s around Ms. Davis is lucky because she’s just a great person.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB Kristie Rieken, The Associated Press See a typo/mistake?

        "content": "Ant McPartlin has revealed to millions of viewers that three of the Britain's Got Talent judges have yet to get his new baby son a gift, after Simon Cowell called a brief halt to Monday's show to congratulate the host on becoming a dad. Mere days after he stepped out with best mate and BGT presenting partner in crime Dec Donnelly for this year's BAFTA TV Awards, Ant was by wife Anne-Marie's side as she gave birth to their baby son - Wilder Patrick McPartlin. And the delighted Britain's Got Talent presenter was the one to break the big news on social media. Taking to his and Dec's joint Instagram account, Ant wrote: \"Welcome to the family. Wilder Patrick McPartlin.. Born, 14/05/24 at 8.54am. Baby is beautiful, Mummy’s a legend, Sisters are over the moon.

I really am happy.\" Responding to Simon, Ant replied: \"Thank you and thank you for your lovely gift,\" before throwing the rest of the panel under the bus, as he added: \"Judges...still waiting on yours.\" Trying to defend them, Simon then interrupted: \"It was from all of us,\" but, having none of it, Ant retorted: \"Ok, yeah, it was signed by you, not them,\" as he then steered the topic of conversation away from him and back to the auditions.

        "content": "Demons May Cry: Leaks about the development of a new Doom game have circulated for years. The latest, unconfirmed rumors suggest a potential reveal date during the upcoming Xbox showcase. Developer id Software and publisher Bethesda Softworks have been busy working on a new game in the Doom franchise for at least four years. This upcoming first-person shooter is expected to be introduced during the Xbox Games Showcase on June 9. A prolific leaker has revealed that the game will be called Doom: The Dark Ages and will transport the Doom Slayer back in time, diverging from the gothic sci-fi settings of the latest installments in the series. Leaker Tom Henderson recently mentioned that the game was previously known as Doom Year Zero , but \"Doom: The Dark Ages\" is expected to be its final name. FPS specialists at id Software started development of The Dark Ages in 2020, shortly after releasing the hyper-kinetic (and hyper-brutal) Doom Eternal on consoles and Windows systems. Also see: Ripping and Tearing: 3 Decades of Doom Unnamed sources have described The Dark Ages as a \"medieval-inspired\" Doom world, which aligns with previous snippets of information about id Software's plans to evolve the series. Microsoft, which now owns Bethesda and the Doom franchise, among others, has stated that the Xbox Games Showcase will reveal new games and updates on the Call of Duty franchise. While Doom hasn't matched the immense popularity of the Call of Duty series in recent years, it remains one of the most profitable brands in the gaming market. Henderson highlighted that an id Software developer claimed in 2020 that Doom Eternal generated over $450 million in revenue for id and Bethesda that year alone. New, unconfirmed leaks about a new game in the Doom universe recently surfaced online, starting with the IDKFA trademark registered by Bethesda's parent company, ZeniMax Media (owned by Microsoft since 2021). A potential Doom-themed reveal during the Xbox Games Showcase was teased earlier this month, and Henderson has now independently verified this rumor. Doom is one of the most storied game franchises ever, with id Software enticing and entertaining fans of the FPS genre (including this humble demon-killing writer) since the early Nineties. Doom Eternal, the latest game in the series, introduced significant innovations in gameplay and visual fidelity thanks to the powerful id Tech 7 game engine.",

        "description": "As ministers have a public spat over Rishi Sunak’s national service plan, Boris Johnson ally Zac Goldsmith has claimed that Tory MPs’ ‘complicity’ is to blame for the election chaos",
        "content": "Zac Goldsmith, who resigned from Rishi Sunak ’s government last year, has hit out at the “complicity” of most Tory MPs in allowing the party to descend into complete chaos less than a week into a general election. The Tory peer, who is a friend and ally of former prime minister Boris Johnson , posted a comment on X (formerly Twitter) warning that most Conservative MPs will lose their seats but that“it is hard to feel sorry for them”. It came as ministers were furiously briefing about their anger over the prime minister calling a snap election without consulting his cabinet first. Only common sense minister Esther McVey and Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris expressed opposition at the cabinet meeting last week when Mr Sunak announced he had been to see the King but others since have privately expressed their anger. Similarly, a public spat has broken out between ministers over Mr Sunak’s weekend announcement that he will reintroduce national service , 61 years since it was scrapped again without consulting his team. First, as revealed by The Independent , Northern Ireland minister Steve Baker publicly distanced himself from the policy in a message to his constituents. Then foreign minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan appeared to contradict home secretary James Cleverly by suggesting 18-year-olds may face fines or imprisonment if they do not agree to join the military or do weekend community work. Deputy chairman James Daly hit back saying that Ms Trevelyan is “not responsible for the policy” and claiming that there will not be any criminal sanctions. But the chaos followed the start of a general election campaign already branded “the worst in history”, where a series of gaffes by the prime minister included giving his address to the nation in the pouring rain without an umbrella while being blasted with the anthem for Tony Blair’s 1997 campaign. He also managed to be interviewed under an exit sign, did an election event at the Titanic Museum in Belfast, and saw scores of Tory MPs run to the exit door to avoid standing again, including cabinet minister Michael Gove. Lord Goldsmith made it clear that he struggled to feel sympathy for a leader who should not have been in office as a result of the downfalls of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. He said: “I understand the anger towards Sunak who has damaged the party almost beyond repair and all but guaranteed the majority of his MPs will lose their job next month. “But it’s hard to muster much sympathy given that none of this would have happened without the complicity of a majority of the party and what is now unfolding was entirely predictable – indeed predicted. “The hope is that when Sunak disappears off to California in a few weeks there are at least some decent MPs left around which to rebuild.” Meanwhile, Labour mocked the Tories for the chaos over the national service policy. Jonathan Ashworth, shadow paymaster general, said: “The Tory campaign is in absolute chaos, with more positions on their flagship policy than the Kama Sutra . “Now, Tory MPs are arguing among themselves about whether they are going to arrest parents, whether it will apply to Northern Ireland and how much it will cost. “It is a shambles, total chaos, and the country deserves so much better.” However, Tory deputy chairman Jonathan Gullis, responded: “Jonathan Ashworth tried desperately to criticise our national service announcement because he knows his party are on the back foot on big ideas. \"As always, Labour are all too happy to snipe from the sidelines, but still haven’t said whether they support or oppose our children getting more skills and better opportunities. Ashworth should speak to his own shadow foreign secretary who praised national service as a ‘worthwhile’ idea. “With no plan, Labour have to resort to dodgy criticism and analysis. No wonder they can’t cost their policies, meaning taxes would rise by £2,094 for every working household.”",

        "description": "This year’s hill where cheese rolling took place was especially slippery and muddy after recent rain.",
        "content": "Participants take part in the annual cheese rolling at Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, England, Monday, May 27, 2024. The traditional event attracts people from around the globe who come to chase a 7-pound Double Gloucester cheese down the steep Coopers Hill. Jacob King/PA via AP LONDON — Dairy-loving daredevils threw caution to the wind Monday for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. Cheered by several thousand spectators, scores of reckless racers chased 7-pound wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill, about 100 miles west of London, since at least 1826, and the sport of cheese-rolling is believed to be much older. The rough-and-tumble event often comes with safety concerns. Few competitors manage to stay on their feet all the way down the 200-yard hill. This year’s hill was especially slippery and muddy after recent rain. Members of a local rugby club lined up at the bottom to catch the tumbling competitors. Tom Kopke from Munich, Germany won one of the three men’s races. He said attitude was more important than technique. “You start and then the adrenaline takes over and you just go, go go,” Kopke said. “Look at this event, look at this hill,” added the muddy, breathless winner. “England is mad. I love it.” Local competitor Josh Shepherd and Dylan Twiss from Perth, Australia won the other two men’s downhill races. Abby Lampe from North Carolina triumphed in the women’s race with a lighting-fast roll that left the rest of the field far behind. “You just have to roll,” said Lampe, a graduate of NC State who also won in 2022. “There’s a little bit of pain, but it’s just going to be temporary.” Dozens of children and adults also competed in safer and slower, but no less grueling, uphill versions of the race, which are traditionally held on a late-May national holiday. About 20 miles (32 kilometers) away in the town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds over a 240-yard course up and down steep Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972, drawing on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town. Success. Please wait for the page to reload.

        "content": "The chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ola Olukoyede, has expressed sadness over the passing of one his predecessors, Ibrahim Lamorde, a retired deputy inspector general of police. In a statement by EFCC’s Head of Media and Publicity, Dele Oyewale, Mr Olukoyede said Mr Lamorde, who led the EFCC from 2012 to 2015, passed away at the age of 61 in Egypt on Saturday. “The loss of this distinguished law enforcement officer whose ideals and accomplishments we have long respected, is painful coming at a time the EFCC and indeed Nigeria still needed his wealth of experience to deal with emerging challenges in the law enforcement environment,” he said. He said Mr Lamorde made significant contributions to the EFCC and the Nigeria Police, where he spent his most productive years. “Mr Lamorde’s demise comes at a time when the EFCC and Nigeria greatly needed his wealth of experience to tackle emerging law enforcement challenges,” Mr Olukoyede noted. He said Mr Lamorde’s tenure at the EFCC included roles as director of operations, acting chairman, and substantive chairman. The statement explained that he was instrumental to establishing EFCC’s investigation machinery and mentoring the corps of officers who are now pivotal to the commission’s investigative activities.

He was also a reformist, and his legacy in the Commission includes the establishment of the Department of Internal Affairs, recently renamed the Department of Ethics and Integrity, and the Department of Public Affairs to drive the Commission’s corruption prevention mandate,” Mr Olukoyede stated. The EFCC chairman said Mr Lamorde renamed the EFCC’s Training and Research Institute in Karu to EFCC Academy, expanding its mandate to train all cadres of officers from the EFCC and other law enforcement agencies across Nigeria and Africa. He said the EFCC Academy has become a central hub for anti-corruption training in West Africa. The EFCC Chairman noted that Mr Lamorde’s lifetime of service as a police officer and statesman would remain a legacy of inspiration. “All of us in the EFCC feel deeply the loss of this soldier of anti-corruption. Our hearts are with his family and all those whose lives he impacted in his remarkable career. We share your bereavement in the loss of this icon. You can be assured that our thoughts and prayers are with you in your grief,” he stressed. The commission prays for the repose of Mr Lamorde’s soul and comfort for his family, the EFCC, and the entire nation. President Bola Tinubu, earlier on Sunday, expressed condolences to the family of Mr Lamorde. In addition to offering sympathies to the family, President Tinubu extended his condolences to the associates of the former anti-graft czar as well as to the EFCC, the Nigeria Police Force, and the government and people of Adamawa State. The President prayed for the repose ofthe soul of the deceased and comfort for his family during this difficult time. Mr Lamorde was born on 20 December 1962 in Mubi, Adamawa State. He attended Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Sociology in 1984. He joined the Nigerian Police Force in 1986. When the EFCC was created in 2003, Mr Lamorde was appointed the pioneer Director of Operations. He served as EFCC Acting Chairman in January 2008, holding the position until Farida Waziri was appointed Chairperson and confirmed by the Senate in June 2008.

        "description": "In response to an unprecedented surge in bear attacks, Japan is looking for ways for humans and animals to co-exist.",
        "content": "On 18 October 2023, in Kita-Akita, a regional city 700km north of Tokyo, local candy store owner Keiji Minatoya was starting his day when a young woman came running from his backyard screaming: \"There's a bear!\" \"I’d lived here for many decades but never seen a bear inside town,\" 66-year-old Minatoya thought and went back inside to continue working on making his butter mochi (a sweet treat). But when he finished work for the day and opened his garage door, he found himself face-to-face with an Asiatic black bear. Staring into the eyes of the 1.8m tall animal, Minatoya's survival instinct kicked in. He ran as fast as he could, but the bear caught up to him and pinned him to the ground before clawing at his face and body. \"I thought I was going to die,\" Minatoya recalled. \"The attack was vicious, so fast, so powerful — it was terrifying.\" Then suddenly the bear stopped its attack, and Minatoya was able to get into his house and call for help. On the same day, a record six people were attacked in Kita-Akita, sending shockwaves across the country. Most frightening of all was that these attacks were not isolated incidents. Source: SBS / Dateline Japan is experiencing an unprecedented surge in bear attacks, with the highest number reported in more than a century. Last year alone, 212 people were attacked by Japanese black or brown bears resulting in six deaths. The Akita prefecture has been particularly hard-hit, with 70 attacks recorded last year, more than anywhere else in the country. The alarming rate of attacks has authorities scrambling to find solutions to keep communities safe. Professor Koji Yamazaki from the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology is one of Japan’s leading experts on bears. His team has been tasked by the government with determining why there were so many attacks in 2023. He says unseasonably high temperatures in autumn last year caused a dramatic decrease in the harvest of the acorns and fruits that bears need to survive in winter. \"With bears, usually the most vital time of year is September. It is a very important period when they consume a lot of food to accumulate their body fat before hibernation,\" Yamazaki explained. Desperate and starving, bears travelled unusually close to towns and villages in search of food. \"If bears eat food scraps that are left near human dwellings, they come back.\" \"Bears also want an easy life like humans. Once they learn an easy way, they won’t give it up.\" Source: Getty / Petesphotography/iStockphoto Another factor contributing to the increasing encounters between bears and people is Japan’s population decline. The Japanese term 'satoyama' refers to areas between mountains and arable flatlands, traditionally used for rice cultivation and forestry. But as more people abandoned agricultural practices and moved away, it has become easier for bears to come closer to villages and towns. \"Mountainous regions, in particular, have seen progressive depopulation and aging population. As a result, bears have more space for their activities,\" Yamazaki said. As the borders between humans and bears blur, the Japanese government has responded by launching a nationwide bear safety program. From public safety videos teaching people how to survive bear attacks to utilising AI technology to monitor bears’ movement patterns, Japan has committed to a variety of measures to inform and keep citizens safe. However, one of the more controversial courses of action is the Japanese government’s new mass culling campaign. In April this year, black bears were placed on the animals designated for control list in the Akita prefecture, meaning hunters can kill bears without restriction and for a bounty. The government has also introduced subsidised ammunition and carcass removal for bear hunters. While the initiative has been welcomed in towns like Kita-Akita, where bear encounters have become particularly common, other communities are searching for solutions that embrace humans and the natural world living in harmony together. Source: SBS / Dateline In Karuizawa, a town 150km west of Tokyo, Picchio Wildlife Research Center has introduced an innovative bear dog program that allows bears and humans to coexist in their respective territories. First developed at the Wind Bear Institute in the United States, the bear dog program aims to make bears afraid of humans by tracking bear movements and when they get close to human dwellings use the dogs to chase the bear away by barking. \"Because humans and bears live so close, in order to coexist, we need to separate our respective territories,\" said dog handler Junpei Tanaka. Tanaka works with Tama, his Karelian Bear Dog, a breed native to Finland known for its ability to hunt brown bears. \"With the help of dogs, we teach bears that humans are dangerous so that the bears that live here stay away from humans.\" Source: SBS / Dateline Since the program’s launch in 2004, it has reported an extraordinary reduction in the damages and incidents involving bears. There have been no bear attacks in town for over a decade, according to Amelia Hiorns, a researcher from Picchio. \"Our management system involves a variety of mitigation techniques. So, the bear dogs, electric fences, bear-proof bins and a community engagement program so that people can understand how to kind of interact and coexist with nature as well,\" Hiorns said. \"We have to accept the bears as much as we can. And obviously [bears] have to accept humans to an extent as well. \"Then I think it is possible to coexist. It's not necessarily going to ever be like perfect harmony, more of a compromise. And that's probably the best way we can do it,\" she said. Share facebook twitter instagram youtube Dateline is an Australian award-winning international documentary series.

        "description": "Landscape photographer Dani Watson realised she was creating a roadmap to dangerous locations for tourists and influencers, who she saw do \"horrific\" things for the sake of a selfie.",
        "content": "Landscape photographer Dani Watson loved posting photos of stunning, remote and unusual locations. Then she realised she was fuelling a dangerous selfie-taking culture. Within hours of posting an image on social media, she would receive a flood of messages from followers. \"They’d ask: 'where did you take it?' 'How did you get there?' 'Can you pinpoint it on Google Maps?'\" she told Insight. \"I realised I was sort of creating a roadmap for tourists and influencers.\" While she may have taken the photo with a drone, having got all the right permissions, the average person trying to replicate such a picture could be putting their lives in danger, she said. \"Photographers like me were taking photos and geotagging and hashtag tagging them, which was creating a wave of popularity in certain locations with tourists or others who wanted to go and capture those images. \"I was part of the problem.\" Monique Sherar knows all too well the perils of accessing dangerous places to take a photo. One beautiful day after lots of rain she was at Empress Falls in the NSW Blue Mountains. She wanted to capture the view but didn't plan to take a selfie. In the end she fell before she even had the chance to take a photo. \"One minute I was walking on the track and the next minute I was tumbling through the air,\" she told Insight. \"I just remember hitting the ground and having this full-body burning sensation. Just like a pain that I never felt before.\" After an eight to 10-metre fall, Monique landed in water at the base of a waterfall. \"It was this compounding pain, water, cold, fear and just anxiety of this overwhelming thing that had happened in a split second.\" Monique had friends with her who were able to get help quickly. While she miraculously avoided any internal bleeding or head injuries, she sustained multiple fractures. She had to have a hip replacement and now has only 50 per cent movement and strength in her left arm. Source: Supplied She says she's become more cautious since the accident. \"I think that I'll always still want to get those photos and get that nice view but now I have a calculated approach to adventure. That thrill-seeking nature of me has left.\" Sergeant Dallas Atkinson, who leads the Police Rescue team in the Blue Mountains, says he's noticed an increase in the volume of people getting out in nature. “I guess it’s a by-product of COVID and being locked away for so long. People are pushing the boundaries a bit more and going into remote locations, without the full appreciation of the dangers,\" he told Insight. Atkinson says the internet and social media now make it easy for people to get directions, though many are ill-prepared for what they may find. “Unfortunately, some people who are going down that path don’t have adequate experience or knowledge ... Nature is also unpredictable so if things go pear-shaped people can be stuck in the middle of nowhere without a lifeline, waiting and hoping to be rescued.\" Source: Supplied / Dani Watson Last year, Samuel Cornell from the University of NSW published the first Australian study of selfie-related deaths, with 379 recorded between 2008 and 2021. \"There's a strong allure on social media for people to get content ... and there's an intrinsic reward for doing so,\" he said. \"Many of these places are in beautiful locations, but also quite hazardous locations. They're hard to rescue people from.\" Cornell believes taking selfies in dangerous places isn't just foolish, it's a public health hazard in the same category as smoking or road traffic accidents and needs to be taken seriously. He has researched the effectiveness of using location-based social media safety messaging to reduce injuries and fatalities at certain locations, and suggests social media influencers could also be useful in sharing the risks. \"We might need to look at using social media influencers to convey safety messages on TikTok and other platforms,\" he said. Photographer Dani's realisation that she was part of the problem led her to start a research project at Melbourne's RMIT University called InstaFame. In it, she documented the risks photographers and tourists were taking in the quest for the perfect pic. As part of her project, she was photographed in dangerous locations, including at the Grampians National Park in Victoria. “Even though weather conditions were perfect, there was no wind and I had a rope nearby ... I remember saying to the friend who was with me that I don’t think I’ve ever felt so uneasy about something. There was nothing under me. I don’t think that enters some people's minds.\" Dani also recognised the toll that so-called selfie tourism was taking on nature. “When I re-visited a location at Trentham Falls in Victoria where I’d taken photographs two years earlier, it was evident the entire spot was decimated. All the lush ferns were gone and walking paths had been carved through the landscape.\" Source: AAP / PR IMAGE But one of the more \"horrific\" things Dani witnessed was at the Sea Cliff Bridge, a popular tourist attraction in the NSW Illawarra region that has become a notoriously dangerous selfie spot and the scene of numerous rescues over the years. \"This guy had rented a minibus and was doing selfie tours. He just parked at the bottom of Sea Cliff Bridge, pointed the way up, and these tourists with no knowledge of the area walked up this goat track to take selfies. \"They walked back down the same way, slipping and sliding, some were only wearing thongs or barefoot. It seemed to me that the tourist operator was profiting from this selfie culture”. A group of photographers took Dani up the same way through the steep cliffs. \"Once I got to the top I was like, 'why?' It’s a great view, but why would you take that risk?\" 22/02/2024 01:00 Share facebook twitter instagram youtube Insight is Australia's leading forum for debate and powerful first-person stories offering a unique perspective on the way we live. facebook twitter instagram youtube 6 min read",

        "content": "SAN DIEGO ( KSWB/KUSI ) — A Carnival cruise ship responded to calls for help and detoured from its normal vacation route on Saturday to help two dozen people stranded at sea off the coast of Mexico. Sailing from its homeport of Long Beach in Southern California, the cruise ship responded to a call from the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Saturday about a small boat full of people who were stranded at sea in the area. According to the cruise line, Carnival Radiance was sailing toward Ensenada, Mexico, Saturday afternoon when they got the call from the Coast Guard. Carnival said the ship was then routed to the location provided and they were able to rescue all 25 people, including three children, who were stranded on a small boat. The Coast Guard said it also launched a small boat and helicopter to assist. Carnival said it then provided food, water and medical assistance to the rescued boaters, while a rendezvous was coordinated with Coast Guard officials. The cruise line noted Carnival Radiance’s three-day cruise from Long Beach will remain on schedule despite the small detour to rescue the boaters in need.",

        "content": "viewers were left on the and Rose Jackson's (Christine Tremarco) secret alliance was unveiled in Monday's dramatic episode. The plot thickened when it was revealed that Ruby had been financially supporting Rose to orchestrate Kim Tate's (Claire King) downfall, but questions arose about the true nature of their 'friendship'. In a clandestine meeting away from prying eyes at the pub, Ruby confessed: \"I paid a small fortune to get those debt collectors off your back,\" to which a thankful Rose responded: \"I know and I'm very grateful.\" Ruby didn't mince her words as she cautioned Rose: \"I'm not made of money. If you renege on that bill, I lose a lot of money. So where are you gonna get the money from?” Rose, undeterred by Ruby's intimidation, retorted: \"You don't scare me. It's not as easy as I thought it would be. I'm not like you. I don't want to hurt people - my family. Since I realised that if I break Kim and Will up, I end up hurting Dawn.\" Their scheme against Kim was evident as Ruby laid out the plan: \"If you go through with the plan, you'll still get Dawn in your life. Sure she'll be a bit upset that Kim and Will have split but you'll be the one who will be mopping up her tears.\" Concerned about her sick child, Rose expressed: \"Evan is still poorly. Can't we wait til he's better and things are more settled?\" But Ruby, focused on the endgame, replied: \"You get your family back and a debt free life - and I get to ruin Kim and make my family happy. It's win-win.\" Could there be more to the friendship between two characters - might they be related? The soap has hinted at a possible DNA surprise that could reveal the pair as sisters. When Rose first strutted into the village, it was clear she had a connection with Will. The plot thickened when it turned out she's Dawn's mum. : \"I am thrilled to be joining ! To be working with such a wonderful cast and crew along with the brilliant writing and production team is an absolute joy! Rose is so much fun to play. She is free spirited, boisterous and totally mischievous with a steely edge and a big heart.\" Adding to the intrigue, producer Laura Shaw said: \"We are massively delighted to welcome Christine Tremarco to the Emmerdale Family. Christine brings a wealth of experience and talent and playing the character of Rose, a true free spirit with an exuberant outlook on life, she certainly promises to cause a real storm for some of our villagers.\"",
