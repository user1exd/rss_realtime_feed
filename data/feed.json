Vance (R-OH) while appearing on MSNBC's \" Morning Joe \" Tuesday -- and now he's accusing Vance of trying to play the victim and deflecting from the real issue.

She was able to have an abortion then, but the United States Supreme Court took away this right in 2022 when it overturned Roe v. Wade. Read Also: Inside the GOP's radical agenda to penalize 'sinners' \"Hadley Duvall is one of the bravest people I've ever met,\" Beshear told MSNBC on Tuesday morning talking about how proud he is of her. He recalled the birth of his children, \"Can you imagine, can you imagine, having to go through that not knowing if your child will survive? Or not hearing that sound at birth. Nobody should have to go through that. Everyone should have options. Mika Brzezinski the brought up false claims made by former President Donald Trump about Democrats supporting abortions even after babies are born. \"It's just lying to people,\" said Beshear. \"I mean, just think about what some people have had to go through because of these laws.

Violence erupted in the country after Khan was arrested in Islamabad by the authorities to probe him in a case of corruption. Anti-terrorism court Judge Malik Ejaz Asif presided over the hearing held at Adiala Jail Rawalpindi, where the police had requested the physical remand of Bibi for further investigation. During the detailed hearing, the court examined the police’s request for physical remand, which was aimed at probing Bibi’s alleged involvement in the 12 cases, including the attack on the General Headquarters (GHQ). However, after careful consideration, the court rejected the police’s plea and discharged Bibi from all related cases. Her lawyer, Salman Safdar, told the media outside the Adiala Jail that she had been named in the cases based on various statements that had no legal standing. “The court thoroughly reviewed the arguments from both sides before delivering its decision,” he said. The lawyer also predicted that the decision to discharge her by the court today was likely to affect the cases of Khan who was also nominated in those cases along with hundreds of other workers of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party.

We wanted her to fit into this world of Gotham that we created from the first movie,” Phillips told Variety. During the interview, the director also shared his thoughts about calling the movie a musical, “Most of the music in the movie is really just dialogue. It’s just Arthur not having the words to say what he wants to say, so he sings them instead...I just don’t want people to think that it’s like In the Heights, where the lady in the bodega starts to sing and they take it out onto the street, and the police are dancing...No disrespect, because I loved In the Heights.” Lead stars Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix joined in on the topic, with Gaga saying, “We asked ourselves what would need to be true for two people to just break into song in the middle of a conversation? Where does the music come from when no one can hear it but the characters? Neither Arthur nor Lee are professional singers and they shouldn’t sound like they are.” Joaquin shared: “It was important to me that we never perform the songs as one typically does...",

Violent storm The Bayesian, a British flagged 56-metre (184-feet) superyacht, sank in the dark shortly before 5 am (0300 GMT) off the port of Porticello, near Palermo, after being hit by a “violent storm,” the Italian coast guard said. The coast guard said bad weather had been forecast, but added that it was more virulent than expected. Some locals spoke of a waterspout, or sea whirlwind, of exceptional force. “It was a strange thing,” fisherman Andrea Carini told Reuters . The Bayesian was at anchor, its sails down, when the tempest hit, with another yacht moored nearby. The other boat The nearby yacht, the 42-metre Sir Robert Baden Powell, remained anchored and weathered the storm after its captain turned on the engine to keep control of the vessel and avoid a collision with the Bayesian. The captain, Karsten Borner, said he did not know if the crew of the Bayesian had managed to switch on its engines. “I don’t think they did things wrong, I think they were surprised by the power of the storm,” he told Reuters. “I only know that they went flat...",

The annual live stream, which kicks off the Gamescom convention in Germany, has become the biggest gaming show outside of Summer Game Fest. That’s no coincidence considering that Geoff Keighley hosts both. This year’s Opening Night Live is set to be the biggest yet, with two hours of game reveals planned. What’s on the docket? More heavy hitters than usual. While previous years primarily spotlighted “AA” games and more niche titles from European studios, this year’s show has some bigger reveals on the menu. We’ll get new looks at Indiana Jones and the Great Circle , Monster Hunter Wilds , Civilization 7 , Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and much more. You can expect some surprises too. Kojima Productions is teasing a new Death Stranding 2 trailer for the show and Keighley himself shared a mysterious teaser for a new horror game before the show. To help you keep up, we’ll be live updating this article throughout the show with every announcement. If you can’t watch it live , or just want to catch up once its all done, make sure to bookmark this page.",

The UN health agency has called for a major increase in vaccine production and said that a vaccination campaign must be a key priority for affected countries. Last week, the health agency of the African Union said some 200,000 vaccines would be deployed across Africa, thanks to agreements with the EU and Danish drug company Bavarian Nordic, whose vaccine was approved in 2019. Some 232 vaccination sites are in place in case of an eventual outbreak in France, Attal posted on the X social media platform. \"We aim to be ready to face all scenarios and all risks,\" he said. No mpox cases have yet been reported in France. Sweden's Public Health Agency announced last week it had registered a case of the more dangerous Clade 1b variant of mpox.

The feud started when Buttigieg was asked if reports on Biden’s inability to serve as president had any role in the now-outgoing president's decision to no longer pursue his reelection bid. Buttigieg then chided “conservative media” for pushing the idea that the Republican Party is continuing to run against Biden, prompting Fox & Friends co-anchor Lawrence Jones to argue that these reports were not from conservative media. When pressed about why Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race , Buttigieg said it was because the president was able to “put his ego aside” and that this is something former President Donald Trump is not able to do. “You can go over whether he slips up and says one name when he wants to say another name, or you can look at what he’s actually accomplished as president,” Buttigieg said on Fox News’s Fox & Friends. “It turns out he’s really good at being president of the United States.” Buttigieg was then asked how the Democratic Party could defend the Biden-Harris administration’s record ahead of the election, and he was shown data indicating that both inflation and crime were up under their watch. The transportation secretary then said violent crime...",

The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, IPBES, is therefore calling for a rapid transformative change that involves all areas of society. However, there are no specific concepts as yet. In the journal People and Nature , biodiversity researchers from the Biodiversity Assessment group Faktencheck Artenvielfalt present a new analytical framework to assess the impact of societal change processes on biodiversity and subsequently derive specific recommendations for the first time. A significant proportion of all animals and plants, almost a third, are threatened by extinction. Yet despite numerous international and national initiatives and agreements for more species protection, this development continues.

Stevenson, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and twice a Democratic candidate for President, collapsed and died of an apparent heart attack Wednesday near the American Embassy in Grosvenor Square. The unexpected death of the 65-year-old statesman, often called his country’s “liberal conscience,” stunned the world and deeply shocked his many friends in Britain. (President Johnson announced in Washington that he had appointed an official delegation headed by Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey to fly to London to escort Stevenson’s body home. The delegation took off aboard a special Presidential jet, in which the body will be returned to the United States. The plane is due in London this morning.) Tapes Interview Only half an hour before he fell to the sidewalk at 5:10 p.m. as he strolled past the International Sportsmen’s Club on Upper Grosvenor St., he had taped a radio interview affirming his government’s policy in Vietnam. Radio and television programs were interrupted to report his death. Prime Minister Harold Wilson, a long-standing friend was informed immediately as his met with Labor Party members of Parliament in the House of Commons.

It also found that the \"manner of death\" is \"homicidal.\" The report of the autopsy conducted on the victim on the evening of August 9 also mentioned that the doctor had 16 external and nine internal injury marks. \"There is medical evidence of forceful penetration/insertion in her genitalia – the possibility of sexual assault,\" the report also stated. Out of the 16 external injuries, there were abrasions on her cheeks, lips, nose, neck, arms and knees, it said adding that there were injuries to her private parts. The report, which specified \"all injuries are antemortem, listed nine internal wounds, including those in the muscles of the scalp, neck and other parts of the body. PTI earlier reported that the post-mortem report indicated the involvement of multiple people behind the death of the post-graduate trainee whose body was found in the seminar room of the RG Kar Hospital on August 9. The case, initially investigated by the Kolkata Police, has since been transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on an order of the Calcutta High Court.",

Josh D’Amaro, chairperson of Disney’s theme park division, said in a statement emailed earlier to The Associated Press that the entertainment giant will waive its arbitration rights and allow the suit – which was brought by the husband of a New York doctor who suffered a fatal allergic reaction after eating at a restaurant in Disney Springs – to proceed in court. “At Disney, we strive to put humanity above all other considerations,” he said in the Monday night statement. “With such unique circumstances as the ones in this case, we believe this situation warrants a sensitive approach to expedite a resolution for the family who have experienced such a painful loss.” Disney had previously argued that Jeffrey Piccolo could not sue the company because he agreed to settle any lawsuits against the company out of court when he signed up for a one-month trial subscription to Disney+ in 2019.

Shocked villagers unearthed the remains, which police at the time said included three children’s skulls, on July 28 in an underground chamber in Mpigi town, some 30 km (18 miles) west of Kampala. “The police crime intelligence squad got a tip-off and they apprehended Lujja Bbosa Tabula on August 19,” police spokesman Kituuma Rusoke told AFP on Tuesday, saying he was in custody. “Tabula was wanted in connection with the human skulls that were found in his residence in Mpigi recently,” he said. Rusoke said Tabula will appear before court once investigations are concluded. He did not indicate a date for the court appearance. It remains unclear how the skulls ended up at the site, located on a steep hill, buried within four metallic boxes inside a two metres (seven feet) deep underground chamber. Local media reported residents as saying that people had previously gathered at the location to worship. Tabula was also wanted by police in connection to a separate case involving the murder of a prominent traditional Baganda leader, entrepreneur Daniel Bbosa, and had been on the run prior to the discovery of the skulls. The killing in Kampala was reportedly carried out by hired gunmen as Bbosa returned home from work in February this year....",

Almost 170,000 workers across the NHS would benefit from the rise if it was accepted, the Scottish Government said, adding the deal would see more than £448 million invested over 2024-25.

        "content": "Summer’s almost over, meaning it will soon be time for autumn and the fall things that come with it, such as pumpkin-spiced drinks and Gilmore Girls . The beloved early ‘00s drama has become a staple for the fall due to its warm colors and the fact that Stars Hollow is basically the place to celebrate all things autumnal. Now, ahead of the show’s likely annual resurgence, creator Amy Sherman-Palladino shared a pretty interesting story involving cake and one of the best sitcoms of all time , The Drew Carey Show, that made me realize how low the budget was on her iconic series. Gilmore Girls was not filmed in Connecticut, where the show is set, but instead, on the sound stages and backlots of Warner Bros. Studio in Hollywood. Add on the fact that it was on The WB before switching networks to The CW, and you'll start to understand why it didn't have the big-budget other series have. While it didn’t seem to matter much from a viewer's standpoint since the show is very high quality, behind the scenes was a different story. Sherman-Palladino gave some insight into this notion while speaking with LA Times as she revealed that, at times, folks over at The Drew Carey Show would send some stuff over to her crew if they had extras, such as sheet cake: On Gilmore Girls, we had zero money. The Drew Carey Show would send over their extra water and half a sheet cake if someone had a birthday...",

Отмечается, что катушка с кабелем разматывается на расстояние до 20 км. Эта система обеспечивает стабильное соединение и хорошее качество картинки на терминале у оператора. «Такие дроны уникальны тем, что они практически неуязвимы для радиоэлектронного подавления... Такая катушка весит всего 1 кг, то есть совсем немного», — объяснил Сивков. Он отметил, что дрон «видит» цель с помощью оптикоэлектроники, для борьбы с такими беспилотниками нужно использовать системы лазерного подавления. «Но такие средства есть пока только у России и в США. Так что это беспилотник, который практически не поражаем для ВСУ», — рассказал специалист. Собеседник RT отметил, что уничтожить их можно только путём огневого поражения.

That’s the reality for a transgender woman in politics. But before McBride can expound on that, she needs another coffee. McBride, 34, basically subsists on coffee; it’s the only thing she consumes before dinner most days.

        "content": "The first human case of West Nile Virus in Boulder County this year has been reported in Longmont. According to a Boulder County Public Health release, a Longmont resident — who was reported to have the virus on Friday — is currently hospitalized and was likely bitten by the mosquito while at home before the symptoms started. Symptoms of the virus can include fever, extreme fatigue, headache, body aches and occasionally skin rashes and swollen lymph nodes. Symptoms generally appear between three days and two weeks after someone is bitten by an infected mosquito, the release said. The department stated that while most cases of West Nile Virus are mild, serious infection can occur and cause encephalitis, otherwise known as inflammation of the brain, and meningitis, known as inflammation of the brain’s lining. Infected people are also at risk of loss of vision, paralysis comas, tremors convulsions and death, according to the release. There is no treatment, cure or human vaccination for the virus, however medical providers can treat symptoms. According to the release, most Colorado cases of the virus are diagnosed in August and September but can be seen as early as May or late as December. “We are hoping for a speedy recovery. Even though this positive case was reported in the Longmont area, we shouldn’t get a false sense of security. Mosquitoes can be present anywhere in the...",

JaDe Rain has changed that, after shocking thousands of viewers on with her take on 18th-century style. The content creator, known online as @jaderainbeauty, took to the platform on June 4 to share a stark depiction of the era's dangerous beauty practices, which featured chemical elements such as lead and mercury. In the , Rain walked viewers through the toxic and harmful chemicals that once adorned the faces of women in the pursuit of beauty. \"The most important thing about 18th-century makeup is that it wasn't really that white,\" Rain, who has a professional background in makeup artistry, told . \"Cosmetics nowadays use titanium dioxide as a replacement for white lead.\" \"It is much brighter and more opaque than white lead,\" she added. Rain applies thick white paint to her face in the video for viewers to see, though she acknowledges that the bold shade she coated her face in on camera was less subtle than the products that would have been worn in the 18th century. The paint had been used to represent the white lead and vinegar concoction used historically. Such mixtures were known to cause severe health issues, including lead poisoning, which could lead to muscle paralysis and even death. \"Would you poison yourself to be prettier?\" Rain asked...",

        "content": "The Philadelphia Flyers placed forward Ryan Johansen on unconditional waivers for the purpose of terminating his contract due to a \"material breach.\" \"The Flyers will have no further comment at this time,\" the team said following Tuesday's terse announcement on social media. Johansen, 32, never appeared in a game for Philadelphia after arriving in a March 6 trade with Colorado that sent defenseman Sean Walker and a 2026 fifth-round draft pick to the Avalanche. The Flyers also received a conditional first-round pick in 2025. The Flyers initially placed Johansen on waivers on the same day he was traded to Philadelphia and tried to assign him to the American Hockey League but were unable to do so because he was injured. General manager Danny Briere addressed the unusual situation in a March 17 interview with Philly Hockey Now, saying it was \"fair to say\" that the team was caught off guard by the hip injury. \"He claimed to be injured when we traded for him, so we had him see the doctors,\" Briere said. \"They found an injury, so now he's going to be rehabbing. You can't send down a player who's injured, so he's going to be doing rehab until ... we don't know when. That's about all I can say at this time, or all that I have. So, he's back on our roster doing rehab and trying to get better.\" Johansen was set to carry a salary cap hit of $8 million in 2024-25 before becoming an...",

The show features industry news, adverts for technology of the time, hardware and software reviews, and interviews with a wide range of computing (and cultural) pioneers. The show had once been preserved by its original makers on reel-to-reel tapes, but over the years these were apparently scattered and lost. The Internet Archive project to preserve the show began when computer historian Kay Savetz acquired several of these tapes at a property sale, and subsequently launched a crowdfunding campaign to digitally archive and make the show available again. \"While full of time-capsule descriptions of 1980s technology news, the most exciting aspect of the show has been the variety and uniqueness of the interviews,\" writes Savetz . \"The list of people that the show interviewed is a who’s-who of tech luminaries of the 1980s: computer people, musicians, publishers, philosophers, journalists. Interviews in the recovered recordings include Timothy Leary, Douglas Adams, Bill Gates, Atari’s Jack Tramiel, Apple’s Bill Atkinson, and dozens of others.\" I adore old technology shows, particularly the thrill of listening to smart people try and puzzle-through where the field is going, alongside...",

Released on August 13, 2024, McDonald’s new Collector’s Meal comes with six different plastic drinking cups that focus on the brand’s various collaborations over the years. The cups include designs from Barbie, Hot Wheels, Beanie Babies, Coca-Cola, Hello Kitty, Peanuts, Shrek, Jurassic Park, Minions, and many more. Some of these feature several brands on the same cup, with different designs on each side. Each meal is roughly $11 USD, making a full set of the popular collectors cups worth around $66 each. However, resellers are already fetching high-dollar prices for the sought-after items. As of writing, the highest-priced single set of McDonald’s Collector’s Edition cups were sold for $228.50 with an extra $15 shipping. There’s also a few slightly cheaper sets that sold for around $150 – which is still around twice the amount one would spend buying them straight from McDonald’s. Those aren’t the most expensive listings, either. Somehow, sellers are getting a hold of full cases that hold 100 of the popular cups. A listing with three cases on August 15, 2024, sold for $1,500 with $25 shipping. For reference, 300 of the Collector’s meals with the cups included would cost just over $3,000.

However, in a surprising move, AMD has now decided to release a new microcode update for older Ryzen processors as well, though the exact reason for this decision remains unclear. Sinkclose is a potentially serious security vulnerability discovered by IOActive analysts in AMD's x86 CPU technology. This low-level bug affects all processors released by the Santa Clara-based corporation since 2006. While AMD acknowledged IOActive's research, the company initially decided to release a microcode-based fix only for some of its most recent CPUs. This decision sparked significant controversy, as widely used processors, some just five years old, were being left unprotected. In response to the backlash, AMD ultimately decided to address the Sinkclose vulnerability in older Ryzen CPUs as well. The company recently updated its security bulletin regarding the SMM Lock Bypass ( CVE-2023-31315 ) issue, which is the formal definition of the security flaw informally known as Sinkclose. On August 14, AMD updated its bulletin to provide a new \"mitigation status\" for Ryzen 3000 desktop processors based on the Matisse (Zen 2) microarchitecture. Although the company anticipated releasing a fix by...",

The company recently faced a serious challenge that pushed it into insolvency due to a dispute with the BCCI. “We settled the case and were on the brink of regaining control of our finances after the NCLAT ruled in our favour,” Raveendran wrote. Over the last several weeks, “several accusatory labels have been made against us – including reckless and damaging allegations that we are fugitives,\" he noted. . Raveendran further said he has always been transparent about his whereabouts and activities, and there has never been an attempt to avoid legal or financial obligations. “The foreign distress lenders have been litigating against us and appealed this ruling in the Supreme Court. The apex court has issued a temporary stay on the NCLAT's decision, which means the control of the company's accounts has not yet been restored to us,” he told employees.

The International Tennis Integrity Agency announced the case on Tuesday. Sinner won the Cincinnati Open on Monday and will be among the favourites at the US Open, which starts in New York next week. Sinner made his debut at No. 1 in the ATP rankings in June and is considered among the top stars of the new generation in men’s tennis, along with Carlos Alcaraz. Sinner, an Italian who turned 23 on Friday, won the Australian Open in January for his first Grand Slam title. He reached the semi-finals at the French Open in June and the quarter-finals at Wimbledon in July, before sitting out the Paris Olympics, saying he had tonsilitis. During the Indian Wells hard-court event in March, Sinner tested positive for low levels of a metabolite of Clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid that can be used for ophthalmological and dermatological use.

Roglic, a three-time winner of the Vuelta, only went in front about five meters from the line to edge Lennert van Eetvelt, who appeared to raise his right arm in a premature victory gesture. The Slovenian star rose in the overall standings to now lead by eight seconds ahead of Joao Almeida, who placed third in the stage. Enric Mas placed fourth in the stage and is third overall, trailing Roglic by 32 seconds. The grueling first mountain stage in the three-week race saw Wout van Aert give up the red jersey he wore for two days. Van Aert finished several minutes back after the 170.5-kilometer trek from Plasencia to Pico Villuercas. Riders faced gradients of up to 20pc in the last few kilometers to the finish and a group of seven approached a sprint to the line. Mikel Landa made the first move but was quickly caught by Van Eetvelt, who approached the slight right-hand final bend in the road thinking he had won.

In “The Slow Road North,” writer Rosie Schaap chronicles her circuitous route from spending most of her life as a dyed-in-the-wool New Yorker to finding herself settling down far away in a small town in Schaap, an established journalist, teacher and occasional bartender in Brooklyn with a cozy apartment she’d lived in for decades, seemed set as a New York lifer. But she is dealt a crushing loss when her husband dies of cancer in 2010, leaving her a widow at 39. A little more than a year later, her mother, with whom she had a complicated relationship, dies, too. Faced with conflicted feelings that she isn’t dealing with her grief in the “right” way, she begins to ache for change. Schapp has a longtime fascination with Ireland and its poets, writers and history, and after returning there over several years, she decides to attend a creative writing program in Belfast in 2019. She soon settles in Glenarm, a coastal town north of Belfast. Facing loads of skepticism — from her friends wondering why she would give up her perfect Brooklyn apartment, from Irish neighbors wondering why an American would move to Glenarm, and even her own fear that she might be running away from her problems — Schaap dedicates herself to becoming involved with Glenarm’s community. She finds solace in the people, the...",

There is one notable change to the selection process — actually, two notable changes: — Expansion of the College Football Playoff creates the potential for more than one of the 12 teams to qualify for the sport’s biggest event, thereby opening opportunities for the non-playoff teams to participate in more prestigious bowls than they otherwise might. — Before the Pac-12 crumbled, conference record was used to determine the selection hierarchy.

        "content": "Newcastle United 's search for Marc Guehi has been dubbed as one of the biggest sagas of the transfer window, with a deal having dragged on for a number of months in a bid to tempt the Crystal Palace star to St. James' Park. But Ben Jacobs has exclusively told GIVEMESPORT that they are in a 'race against time' for his signature. Guehi has been an ideal target for many clubs across the Premier League , though with 10 days left he remains at Selhurst Park - including captaining the club on Sunday. But with centre-back partner Joachim Andersen being linked with a move away from the club, Newcastle must hurry as Palace won't be willing to lose both of their star men in their backline.

Former Phoenix City Council member Yassamin Ansari led by 42 votes over former state lawmaker Raquel Terán in the race for Arizona's 3rd District.

Whoever wins will face Republican Jeff Zink in the general election in November. The began Aug. 12 after the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors certified the results of the primary.
