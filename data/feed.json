        "content": "As gene sequencing technologies become more powerful, our understanding of cellular diversity has grown in parallel. This led scientists at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital to create a tool to improve the ease and accuracy with which investigators can study specific subpopulations of cells. The tool, named Conditional Viral Expression by Ribozyme Guided Degradation (ConVERGD), allows researchers to specifically access these subgroups of cells and precisely manipulate them based on multiple features of the cell. ConVERGD offers numerous advantages over existing intersectional expression platforms by accommodating more complex genetic payloads and increased adaptability. The researchers demonstrated the utility of ConVERGD by studying a previously unidentified subpopulation of norepinephrine neurons. The work demonstrates the substantial impact that investigations into cellular subpopulations could have on fundamental research and health care. The findings were published today (May 27) in Nature Neuroscience . For Lindsay Schwarz, Ph.D., St. Jude Department of Developmental Neurobiology, necessity drove invention as she explored the neuronal cell landscape, and in particular, neuronal cells that produce norepinephrine. \"Norepinephrine neurons have been thought to be just one type of neuron. But when they're activated in the brain, they can cause a lot of different types of behavior, such as enhancing attention and memory formation or eliciting a stress response or fight-or-flight response,\" Schwarz said. \"But if it's only one type of neuron releasing this one molecule, then how does it make you do different things?\" To explore such questions requires the ability to selectively interrogate cellular subpopulations with extreme prejudice. To this end, Schwarz found all attempts using current practices were coming up short. \"We didn't go into this project thinking we would build a new tool, but it seemed like a need in the community.\" Targeting subpopulations of cells requires passing them through several genetic filters. These intersectional filters interrogate what genes the cells express and what pathways and connections they make, parsing out the different subpopulations so that researchers can focus on a select group of isolated cells. The use of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based reporter tools which can deliver genetic material into specific cells with high precision is an ideal approach for applying these intersectional filters. These reporter tools are used to label or monitor gene expression and protein localization within specific cells or regions. However, they can be complex to design and offer a limited amount of space within them. \"One of our main goals was to design a tool where your gene of interest only got expressed when conveyed with multiple features but is really easy for end users to modify and put in whatever genes they want,\" explained Schwarz. Robust ribozymes offer next-generation specificity Schwarz and first author Alex Hughes, Ph.D., a graduate of the St. Jude Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, currently of the Allen Institute for Brain Science, leveraged two separate technologies in the design of ConVERGD, namely AAV-based reporter technology and inspiration from the world of ribozymes, strands of RNA that can behave like enzymes by catalyzing biochemical reactions. Importantly, ribozymes can be engineered to control the on/off switch for gene expression with extreme precision. \"We initially heard about ribozymes from a journal club that was thinking more therapeutically about how to use AAVs,\" Schwarz said. \"Alex came back and figured that he could come up with a way to utilize these in neuroscience tools.\" As a proof-of-concept, Schwarz and Hughes used ConVERGD to interrogate a subpopulation of norepinephrine neurons. \"Collectively, norepinephrine neurons do a lot of different things,\" Schwarz explained. \"The subset we were targeting makes norepinephrine, but they also make this other opioid peptide called dynorphin, which hasn't been characterized in these neurons before. With ConVERGD, we found that activating just these dynorphin-expressing neurons was enough to elicit an anxiety response.\" By parsing out the functions and assigning them to a subpopulation of cells, Schwarz is hopeful that targeted therapy is a possibility. \"We treat anxiety and depression with drugs that target norepinephrine signaling, but they target it globally,\" Schwarz said. \"You're also going to see a detriment to other important functions for norepinephrine that you don't want to see. Targeting these neurons more specifically could help to ameliorate that.\" The work will have ripple effects outside of St. Jude. \"We're really excited about this for the community,\" Schwarz said. \"ConVERGD should be amenable to any tissue. It could be useful beyond neuroscience.\" More information: Alex C.

        "content": "Samsung 's Galaxy S24 Ultra, which has been experiencing camera issues since its launch, is expected to receive a significant software update in August. This information was revealed by reliable tech insider Ice Universe on X . The company is currently testing a major software update, One UI 6.1.1, specifically designed to address these camera problems. Ice Universe posted, \"This is the One 6.1.1 version of Galaxy S24 Ultra, and testing has started.\" Update was initially slated for July Ice Universe initially suggested a July release for the firmware, coinciding with the launch of the foldable Galaxy Z Flip6 and Z Fold6. However, in a subsequent post on Weibo, the tipster confirmed that Samsung will roll out the One UI 6.1.1 update for the S24 Ultra in August. This software patch is being described as the most significant update for the S24 since its release, and is expected to include numerous camera updates. Galaxy S24 Ultra users report various camera issues Users of the Galaxy S24 Ultra have reported a range of camera issues. These include excessive noise in low-light sky areas, overexposure in specific frame sections, and banding in sky portions of images. There's also an oil painting effect at high zoom levels (10x and above). Additionally, low-light video recording has been problematic for some users due to significant grain and noise. Samsung's unusual update strategy Samsung typically doesn't release point-revision firmware like One UI 6.1.1 for its non-foldable phones. Therefore, Galaxy S24 Ultra users seeking camera improvements should be on the lookout for the upcoming July security update. This might potentially pave the way for the larger, camera-focused update in August. However, official information from Samsung is limited at this point. Users will need to wait for official announcements, to get a clearer picture of the exact improvements and official release date of the update.",

        "content": "Clinics specializing in first seizures reduce the need for patients to present at emergency departments or be admitted to hospital later, Monash University-led research has found. Published in JAMA Neurology , the study analyzed patients who attended first seizure clinics (FSCs) at two major Melbourne public hospitals , The Alfred and the Royal Melbourne Hospital (RMH). Timely attendance, particularly within 14 days of the seizure, was associated with reduced subsequent all-cause emergency presentations and all-cause hospital admission. Later hospital admissions were reduced by about 25%. First author Dr. Yingtong Li, an adjunct research associate with the Department of Neuroscience in Monash University's School of Translational Medicine, said first seizure clinics were effective, and equitable access could offer substantial benefits to patients and health care systems. \"The findings show that early intervention in patients with seizures, when delivered through first seizure clinics, is highly effective and has the potential to change the trajectory of patients' subsequent health, through the lens of their health care utilization,\" Dr. Li said. \"In Australia, acute seizure care is estimated to cost AU$340 million annually. Our results suggest that approximately one-quarter of this (AU$85 million annually) could possibly be avoided if all patients were able to attend a first seizure clinic soon after their first event, accessing prompt, specialist care.\" First seizure clinics were pioneered in Perth in 1990, established in Melbourne in 1994 and now serve several cities in Australia, the U.S., U.K. and Canada. They aim to deliver prompt specialist care to first-time seizure patients. The clinics offer prompt access to clinical assessment and investigations such as electroencephalography (EEG) and neuroimaging. If appropriate, diagnosed patients take antiseizure medications and may be referred to their GP or neurologist. Other studies have demonstrated that first seizure clinics reduce time to diagnosis and treatment, but they have been limited in sample size and follow-up duration. The new record-linkage retrospective study aimed to identify whether clinic attendance improved long-term outcomes and reasons people may not attend the clinics. The research covered 9,392 patients with a mean age at referral of 59.7 years, and found that clinic attendance, particularly early attendance, was associated with reduced rates of subsequent hospital use. The authors found that patients benefited from early intervention. However, while international guidelines recommend neurologist review within two weeks, wait times can exceed this target, and such delays are associated with detrimental outcomes. Senior author Dr. Emma Foster, a neurologist, co-head of Alfred Health's First Seizure Clinic and a Monash University School of Translational Medicine researcher, said the findings were exciting. \"There are some really important future research directions that follow on from this,\" Dr. Foster said. \"Firstly, these clinics are resource intensive and only located in a handful of hospitals across Australia. \"Detailed health economic analyses are needed to understand if they are a cost-effective intervention. If yes, that would support their widespread implementation both in Australia and internationally. \"Secondly, this pilot study shows that attending First Seizure Clinic within 14 days of being referred significantly reduces the chance of future hospital attendances. Future studies need to identify and minimize the various barriers to First Seizure Clinic attendance across our community. \"Finally, health care utilization is just one of the impacts of first seizures. Future research should consider the personal impact of first seizures on people's mood, work, and quality of life. This may raise awareness and perhaps support interventions to reduce this burden on individuals and their families.\" More information: Yingtong Li et al, Early Access to First-Seizure Clinics, Subsequent Outcomes, and Factors Associated With Attendance, JAMA Neurology (2024).

        "content": "Gadwal: The poor people in Gadwal district, urged the district Collector BM Santhosh to save the 100 beds hospital in Alampur Chourasta. A large-scale theft of medical supplies at the hundred-bed hospital in Alampur constituency has raised serious concerns among the local population. This hospital, seen as a beacon of hope for many, remains non-operational even six months after the opening, causing immense hardship, particularly for the poor. The community is frustrated with the ruling party, which has consistently promised to prioritize healthcare but has failed to deliver. The lack of a functioning hospital is particularly worrying with the upcoming rainy season, which often brings seasonal diseases. The inaction by the District Medical Officer and the silence of Collector Santhosh, known for his stance against injustice, have only added to the frustration. Residents are questioning why neither the authorities nor the public associations and political parties have taken any significant steps to address this issue. They demand that the Collector intervene urgently to reopen the hospital and ensure that it serves the community as intended. Ignoring such a significant problem is seen as tacit support for wrongdoing, and there is a growing call for accountability and action. In light of these concerns, the following steps are essential: 1. Immediate Investigation: Launch a thorough investigation into the theft to bring the perpetrators to justice and recover the stolen supplies. 2. Reopen the Hospital: Prioritize the reopening of the hospital to provide much-needed healthcare services, especially with the rainy season approaching. 3. Public Accountability: Authorities, including the Collector and the District Medical Officer, should address the public, explaining the delays and outlining steps to rectify the situation. 4. Security Enhancements: Implement robust security measures to prevent future thefts and ensure the hospital's resources are protected. 5. Community Involvement: Engage with community leaders and associations to restore trust and ensure transparency in the hospital’s operations. The people of Alampur deserve better healthcare services, and it is crucial for the authorities to act swiftly to meet these needs and restore faith in the system.",

        "content": "The new series of the ITV2 dating show will see a raft of singletons enter the villa in Majorca hoping to find a match. They include Patsy Field, 29, an office administrator from Orpington, who said her disability is the one quality she would like her other islanders to know about her. A post shared by Love Island (@loveisland) She said “I’ve got something very special about me which is my disability, it’s a condition I was born with called Erb’s Palsy. “It doesn’t define who I am, but it makes me a little different, although I’ve learnt to get on with it and it’s never held me back.” The condition is a paralysis of the arm caused by injury to the upper group of the arm’s main nerves resulting from a difficult birth. She added: “My friends would say that I’m the loudest person in the group, I’m the one who’s always up for doing a dare, they’d say I was the life and soul of the party. “My family would say that I’m bossy and that it’s always my way or the highway, they’d say I rule the roost.” She will be joined by Samantha Kenny, 26, a make-up artist from Liverpool, who said: “I’m ready to settle down and Love Island is an amazing opportunity to meet someone that isn’t from my area. I love a cockney boy so I’m hoping there is one in there for me. A post shared by Love Island (@loveisland) “I think I will definitely bring some fire, I’m very opinionated and wear my heart on my sleeve. I’m really bubbly too so I’ll definitely have a laugh as well as bringing some Scouse glamour.” Semi-professional footballer Ronnie Vint, 27, from London, will also enter the villa. The sportsman is close friends with previous contestant Olivia Attwood and her husband, the footballer Bradley Dack. He said: “Bradley Dack is my best friend and he and Olivia are a big part of my life. A post shared by Love Island (@loveisland) “I call Olivia my big little sister, she always looks out for me.” They will be joined by Munveer Jabbal, 30, a recruitment manager from Surbiton, Nicole Samuel, 24, an accounts manager from Aberdare, and Ciaran Davies, 21, a surveyor from Pencoed, South Wales. Mimii Ngulube, 24, a mental health nurse from Portsmouth, described herself as “a girls’ girl”, adding: “My girls are my rocks and I’m theirs so I’ll be a good friend as well as going in there to find a man. “I like dressing up so I’ll bring style, and I’d like to think I’m quite funny so I’ll make people laugh. Bringing honesty as well – I’m good at picking up on people’s personality traits and side-eyeing those who might be a liar.” A post shared by Love Island (@loveisland) Sam Taylor, 23, a hair stylist from Chesterfield, Ayo Odukoya, 25, a model from Canning Town, Harriett Blackmore, 24, a dancer and personal shopper from Brighton and Sean Stone, 24, a salesman from Herford will be joined by Jess White, 25, a retail manager from Stockport, who said she is specific about the qualities she prioritises in a partner. She said: “I would say nice teeth, I love a set of white Turkey teeth but a good set of Turkey teeth. A post shared by Love Island (@loveisland) “I would say personality traits, you have to be family orientated. I’m so close to my mum and I’d like my future partner to be really close with their family too. “You have to be tall, you can’t be shorter than me, I can’t be having to question whether I can wear heels around you and what height of heels I can wear. If you’re vertically challenged, it’s not for me.” Love Island returns to screens on Monday June 3 at 9pm. The first episode will be simulcast across ITV1, ITV2, ITVX and STV.",

        "description": "Labour has accrued millions of views with memes about the Tories’ national service pledge.",
        "content": "The Conservatives’ launch on TikTok has been branded “pretty pathetic” by an expert who praised Labour’s “savvier” social media team. Social media has been touted as a key battleground in general elections for many years, but having launched in the UK in August 2018 TikTok was only in its infancy during the last poll in December 2019. Likely to play a bigger role than ever this election, the Chinese app was banned from Government phones in March 2023 due to data security concerns but both parties launched profiles in recent days. Despite the Prime Minister announcing the General Election last Wednesday, Labour launched on TikTok three days before the Conservatives – posting an 11-second video on Thursday evening of leader Sir Keir Starmer declaring: “Change. That is what this election is about.” Since then, the feed has been a mixture of clips from the party’s campaign trail, brief explainers and, most successfully, memes mocking the Tories and the Prime Minister. The Conservative Party shared their first TikTok on Sunday morning – a 50-second clip of Rishi Sunak in a white shirt announcing he plans to introduce mandatory national service for 18-year-olds if he returns to Number 10. Journalist Chris Stokel-Walker, author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World’s Favourite App, believes the Opposition have come out on top on the platform so far – describing Tory efforts as “soulless and lifeless”. “The fact that both major parties have taken to TikTok to spread the word about their campaigns is interesting, not least because of the fears that have been stoked about TikTok being a national security threat – concerns that haven’t, to date, been backed up by any evidence,” Mr Stokel-Walker told the PA news agency. “It’s pretty clear that Labour have a savvier social media team who have pretty effectively managed to minimise the Tories’ claims, not least their clever way of adopting memes to try and rubbish Rishi Sunak’s policy of national service. “Meanwhile, for someone meant to be tech-savvy, Sunak’s TikTok presence has been pretty pathetic: not only are the videos pretty soulless and lifeless, but they seem to ignore the fact you have to grab viewers’ attention right from the off, instead going ponderously through the Tories’ lines to take on various policies.” Mr Sunak’s national service pledge has become fodder for memes on Labour’s page. A post with over two million views and more than 316,000 likes, captioned “Rishi Sunak announcing national service”, sees Lord Farquaad, the diminutive chief antagonist of the 2001 children’s film Shrek, announce: “Some of you may die, but it’s a sacrifice I am willing to make.” Another similarly popular clip depicts “Rishi Sunak turning up on your 18th birthday to send you to war”, with a viral video of late TV host Cilla Black singing her 1980s track “Surprise Surprise” on the show of the same name. While the Conservatives’ first post received over 1.2 million views, it received 85,000 likes and over 10,000 comments as Mr Sunak asked for questions about the national service policy. Those questions included “what if I wanted to go to university” and “who is paying me to do it?” In response to that second question, a follow-up video on Monday saw Mr Sunak explain the Government would “provide a stipend to help with living costs” for those joining the military and provide “funding for training and administration” for community work. Although it is early days – the Conservatives had shared just four TikToks by Monday afternoon to Labour’s 25 – the approach by Sir Keir Starmer’s party has been more successful. Labour has more than 43,000 TikTok followers to the Convervatives’ 13,000 and they have received over 10 times more likes on the platform – with more than 930,000 to 87,000 for the Tories. “It’s clear that for younger users the Labour campaign’s use of TikTok is more likely to be a more natural fit but, actually, I think you’ll find that it cuts through to older voters, too,” said Mr Stokel-Walker. “A lot of the memes that Labour have used so far, particularly around the national service policy, are ones that people who spend any time on Facebook, X or even a family WhatsApp group will recognise – and probably laugh at. “We’ve heard for more than a decade now that every general election is the ‘first social media election’, but there’s no doubt that online campaigning will be important to get the message out to voters – particularly younger ones.” TikTok was banned from Government devices over fears about how information such as contacts, user content and geolocation data could be used by the company’s Beijing-based owner ByteDance. In the announcement of the ban in March 2023, then Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Oliver Dowden described the decision as a “prudent and proportionate step following advice from our cyber security experts”.",

        "content": "Actor Janhvi Kapoor's will be seen next in Mr and Mrs Mahi. The film backed by Karan Johar, Zee Studios, Hiroo Yash Johar and Apoorv Mehta also stars Rajkummar Rao in the lead. The Quint caught up with the actor who shared an advice her mother gave her, weighed in on her relationship and outfits making headlines, spoke about what sets her co-star Rajkummar apart from other actors, not needing validation, and more. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Speaking about a piece of advice her mother, Sridevi, gave her that she applies in her career, the actor said, \"To with my craft, mom told me, in order to be a good actor you must first be an honest person. If there is any amount of artifice in your personality, in real life then you won't know how to be truthful on camera. Your instincts will be corrupted. You need to protect your instincts and the child in you. That's the most useful and helpful advice she could give me.\" 0 When asked if she thinks it's fair when focus shift from work to personal space, the actor said, that it is a professional hazard and she doesn't take it the seriously. \"I am flattered by the interest. I recognise that it is easier to lure people in with frivolous things like my relationship, where I went for a holiday, what I am wearing as that is easier consumption for the audience. To ask them to come and watch my work, requires a lot more investment. I am no hurt about it because I still have the opportunity to do the work I want to. I am not seeking validation that much.\" She believes that if people watch her movie and like it, if it does the numbers and are moved by the story, she has won. Mr and Mrs Mahi is directed by Sharan Sharma will release on 31 May. ( At The Quint, we are answerable only to our audience. Play an active role in shaping our journalism by becoming a membe r .

        "content": "A team of computer scientists at Purdue University has found that the popular LLM, ChatGPT, is wildly inaccurate when responding to computer programming questions. In their published as part of the , the group describes how they pulled questions from the StackOverflow website and posed them to ChatGPT and then measured its degree of accuracy when responding. The team also presented their findings at the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems ( ) held May 11–16. ChatGPT and other LLMs have been in the news a lot recently—since such apps have been made available to the general public, they have become very popular. Unfortunately, along with a treasure trove of useful information included in many of the responses given by such apps, there are a host of inaccuracies. Even more unfortunate is that it is not always clear when the apps are giving answers that are wrong. In this new study, the team at Purdue noted that many programming have begun using LLMs to not only help write code for programming assignments, but to answer questions related to programming. As an example, a student could ask ChatGPT, what is the difference between a bubble sort and merge sort, or, more popularly, what is recursion? To find out how accurate LLMs are in answering such questions, the research team focused their efforts on just one of them—ChatGPT. To find questions to use for testing the app, the researchers used questions freely available on the StackOverflow website—it is a site that has been built to help programmers learn more about programming by working with others in their field of interest. On one part of the site, users can post questions that will be answered by others who know the answers. The research team used 517 questions found on the site and then measured how often ChatGPT gave the correct answer. Sadly, it was just 52% of the time. They also found the answers tended to be more verbose than would be the case when a human expert was asked the same question. Alarmingly, the team found that user study participants preferred the answers given by ChatGPT 35% of the time. The researchers also found that the same users reading the answers given by ChatGPT quite often did not catch the mistakes that were made—they overlooked wrong answers 39% of the time. © 2024 Science X Network",

        "description": "Both have signed with Tennessee and are part of a Volunteers signing class ranked No. 11 nationally.",
        "content": "VIRGINIA BEACH — Two of the best girls soccer players in Hampton Roads are wrapping up their final chapter in high school. First Colonial High’s Skylar and Sydney Miller have been giants in the Virginia Beach preps soccer world — despite their smaller stature — in the last four years. The twins, both seniors, are in the midst of their final playoff run and are looking to finish it the way it started: with a state championship. “I feel like since this is our last one, it just makes us want to win it even more,” Sydney Miller said. “Ending it how we started would be amazing.” The Miller twins were members of the Patriots team that won a state title in 2021, their freshman year. First Colonial has made it to the state finalist and semifinalist while they’ve been on the team and has compiled a 61-6-3 record in the last four years. Head coach Joe Tucei said it’s hard to sum up just how much the Miller twins have meant to the Patriots’ success. “Obviously the success wouldn’t be as great without them for sure,” Tucei said. “I mean, we were successful before they got here. But their leadership, their competitiveness — they bring that to practice. They bring it every day and it permeates throughout the team.” Tucei has called Skylar and Sydney two of the most dynamic players he’s ever coached. He said he knew the Miller twins were something special as far back as sixth grade. “Well, just their speed of play and their technical ability,” Tucei said. “They attack off the dribble like no one. I mean they will attack you. And they’re relentless, they’ll keep going at you and at you. They’ve worked on it this year, their distribution of the ball is great. ... That technical ability to be able to play at speed with the ball.” While Tucei may have been clairvoyant seeing their future success in the sixth grade, the twins themselves said the start of high school was when they realized their talent levels. “I think freshman year is kind of like when everything kind of clicked,” Skylar Miller said. “I was like, all right, we need to take this seriously. Just knowing that we want to put everything into something and our dream is kind of when it all started clicking.” The twins have both played on the First Colonial varsity squad all four years and have produced nearly identical stat lines. Skylar has scored 59 goals while Sydney has scored 64. They’ve combined for nearly 100 assists and more than 330 points in their career — and there are still games to be played. The second-seeded Patriots play No. 3 seed Great Bridge at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday in a Class 5 Region A Tournament semifinal at Ocean Lakes High. Top-seeded Kellam plays No. 5 Ocean Lakes at 5:30 p.m. in the other semifinal. Both have also raked in their fair share of awards in the last three years and will likely do so again at the conclusion of this season. Skylar is a three-time all-state player, two-time Gatorade Virginia Player of the Year nominee and a United Soccer Coaches All-American. Sydney has been named to the all-state first team twice, all-region three times and was the Class 5 Region A Player of the Year in 2023. Both have been All-Tidewater first-team selections the last three years. It’s one thing to compete at a high level and be rewarded for your hard work, but getting to do it with your twin sister makes it even better. “It definitely makes it a lot more special,” Sydney Miller said. “We have each other to cheer each other on. If we don’t feel good one day, we have each other to cheer each other up. So that’s good.” The connection between the two is just part of the reason the two are so dynamic, Tucei said “I think we just know how to play off of each other,” Skylar Miller said. “Like we’re always constantly moving, thinking ahead, and always knowing what you’re going to do next — whether that’s defensively or offensively. It’s a good trait that we both have.” That bond just makes Tucei’s job as a coach that much easier, he joked. “Those are the little great mysteries you can’t coach,” Tucei said. “All they have to do is look at each other. It’s just a glance and they know what’s happening. ... When you have players as good as them you never want to stymie the creativity. Yes, we come out, we have formation, we have shape but I let them do them. Let them be themselves.” While the Millers’ ride at First Colonial is nearing its end, it won’t be the end of their soccer journey together. Both are signed to continue playing collegiately at Tennessee and are part of a signing class ranked No. 11 nationally. “It’s super good going together, that’s going to be helpful,” Sydney Miller said. “Knowing it’s not over now, it’s just comforting.” While they’ll have each other during their next chapter the twins will be without Tucei, who surpassed 400 career wins this season and said it’s been a “dream” to coach them for so long. “Whenever I’m anxious or nervous, he always knows how to calm me down and we’re just comfortable with him,” Skylar Miller said. “He always knows exactly what to say to make us feel better. ... He’s just really, really supportive on and off the field. He’s been really good to me and Sydney.” A win in Tuesday’s region semifinals would put the Patriots in the region championship game, but more importantly, would guarantee them a Class 5 state tournament bid. The ultimate hope is that they end their last ride by bringing another title home for Tucei. “I definitely think we can get there just taking it one day at a time,” Sydney Miller said. “Everyone staying clear of injuries, hydrated and being together as a team. Creating connections with each other and just like the energy everywhere needs to be good. I think energy is a really big part of our team and that’s what makes everyone care so much.” Michael Sauls, (757) 803-5774, michael.sauls@virginiamedia.com Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on X (Opens in new window)",

        "content": "Paul George has a player option on his contract for the 2024-25 season and could be one of the most sought-after free agents this summer if he declines it, but the Los Angeles Clippers have reportedly hesitated to give him a massive offer at this point. Kevin O'Connor of The Ringer reported Monday that the Clippers \"haven't offered George a dollar more than what they paid [Kawhi] Leonard: three years, $152.4 million.\" That is the case even though Los Angeles could offer him a four-year, $221 million deal. If the Clippers don't increase their bid, that would give other teams the opportunity to land the nine-time All-Star. O'Connor said the Philadelphia 76ers' \"Plan A\" for free agency is pursuing George. The 76ers can offer him a four-year, $212 million deal, which is more than Los Angeles is currently offering the swingman. Keith Pompey of the Philadelphia Inquirer noted the 76ers' \"desire to sign Paul George is well-known,\" so the Clippers could have some serious competition. It is at least somewhat understandable why Los Angeles might be hesitant to give that kind of deal to someone who is 34 years old with a history of injury concerns. While George played 74 games this season, it was the first time he appeared in more than 56 games since the 2018-19 campaign. That just so happened to be his last season with a team outside of the Clippers. Leonard, who will turn 33 years old in June, also has quite the injury history and hasn't reached the 70-game mark in a season since he was with the San Antonio Spurs in 2016-17. Further committing to the Leonard and George duo for multiple years into the future at this stage of their careers may not be the best path forward to compete in the loaded Western Conference. George is still excellent when healthy and averaged 22.6 points, 5.2 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 1.5 steals per game while shooting 47.1 percent from the field and 41.3 percent from deep this past season. That type of production would play in any lineup, and the Clippers surely want him back. They just might not want him back enough to top an offer from the 76ers or others.",

        "description": "Out of 115 matches Nadal has played at Roland Garros, only thrice has he been taken to the deciding set with the Spaniard emerging victorious every time.",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal has dominated French Open like no other player has ever done at any Major in the Open era. Nadal has lifted the winner’s trophy at Roland Garros a record 14 times and has suffered defeat in only three out of 115 matches at the clay Major. With such a record, it is not a surprise that on only three occasions, Nadal has been taken to a deciding set in Paris. Nadal had his first five-setter in the opening round in 2011. The defending champion faced John Isner, a 6’10” American with a big serve. The Spaniard grabbed the first set but went on to lose the next two in tiebreaks. However, he raised his level to win the fourth and deciding sets fairly comfortably. The second time Nadal was pushed to five set in Paris happened in the semifinals of the 2013 edition. Facing World No. 1 Novak Djokovic, the Spaniard led by two sets to one. He served for the match at 6-5 in the fourth set but the Serbian broke back and won the tiebreaker. In a rollercoaster of a fifth set, Djokovic got the early break but lost his advantage in controversial fashion. In the eighth game, Djokovic hit a smash but before the ball could bounce twice, he slipped and hit the net, thus losing the point. Nadal broke back to make it 4-4. The two players held their serve till 7-7 (there was no 10-point tiebreak at 6-6 in the final set back then) when Nadal broke again and then, served successfully for a place in the final. His most recent deciding-set battle at Roland Garros took place in 2022. Playing against Canada’s Felix Auger-Aliassime, coached by the Spaniard’s uncle Toni, Nadal led by two sets to one before Auger-Aliassime fought back to win the fourth set. However, Nadal did not let things go out of hand clinched the decider 6-3. Comments Related Topics",

        "description": "False narratives mainly concerned domestic affairs.",
        "content": "According to a new quarterly report CEDMO Trends , this March Slovaks allegedly encountered more fake news than true news for the first time since August 2023 when surveys began to be carried out. The first round of presidential elections took place later in March. In addition to Slovakia, the report also covers the Czech Republic and shows how many people are reached by disinformation narratives and how many found them credible. While in the Czech Republic the most widespread false narrative reached 45 percent of the population, in Slovakia it was 58 percent. When it comes to how much people trust them, both countries are rather similar; between 11 to 58 percent of Czechs and 10 to 55 percent of Slovaks found them credible. The narratives mainly focused on domestic politics and the war in Ukraine, with some anti-EU and anti-NATO takes as well. In January, fake news that presidential candidate Ivan Korčok held a US passport, making him a US citizen and thus a US agent, reached more than 25 percent of Slovaks. About the same number of people found the claim credible. In February the claim continued to spread, but this time with the addition that Korčok was collaborating with the Czechoslovak secret police (ŠtB). The narrative had a reach of 45 percent and credibility of 36 percent. When it comes to Ukraine, reports that the war was being waged only in the eastern part of the country had a reach of 58 percent and credibility of 37 percent. There were also false claims that Slovak soldiers would be deployed to Ukraine , which PM Robert Fico was allegedly trying to prevent, thus putting him at a risk of removal from office (reach 53 percent, credibility 40 percent). One piece of fake news concerned Slovak hockey player Július Hudáček, who was sacked two days after signing a contract with the Czech club HC Rytíři Kladno. According to the narrative, former player and club owner Jaromír Jágr was pressured to do so by media, NGOs and sponsors. Hudáček played in the Russian KHL, for which he was criticised. CEDMO Trends SR runs for 24 months. CEDMO has been conducting the research in Slovakia from August 2023 in cooperation with IPSOS agency and with financial support from Google on a representative sample of more than 1,900 respondents over 16 years of age.",

        "description": "Labour has accrued millions of views with memes about the Tories’ national service pledge.",
        "content": "The Conservatives’ launch on TikTok has been branded “pretty pathetic” by an expert who praised Labour’s “savvier” social media team. Social media has been touted as a key battleground in general elections for many years, but having launched in the UK in August 2018 TikTok was only in its infancy during the last poll in December 2019. Likely to play a bigger role than ever this election, the Chinese app was banned from Government phones in March 2023 due to data security concerns but both parties launched profiles in recent days. Despite the Prime Minister announcing the General Election last Wednesday, Labour launched on TikTok three days before the Conservatives – posting an 11-second video on Thursday evening of leader Sir Keir Starmer declaring: “Change. That is what this election is about.” Since then, the feed has been a mixture of clips from the party’s campaign trail, brief explainers and, most successfully, memes mocking the Tories and the Prime Minister. The Conservative Party shared their first TikTok on Sunday morning – a 50-second clip of Rishi Sunak in a white shirt announcing he plans to introduce mandatory national service for 18-year-olds if he returns to Number 10. Journalist Chris Stokel-Walker, author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World’s Favourite App, believes the Opposition have come out on top on the platform so far – describing Tory efforts as “soulless and lifeless”. “The fact that both major parties have taken to TikTok to spread the word about their campaigns is interesting, not least because of the fears that have been stoked about TikTok being a national security threat – concerns that haven’t, to date, been backed up by any evidence,” Mr Stokel-Walker told the PA news agency. “It’s pretty clear that Labour have a savvier social media team who have pretty effectively managed to minimise the Tories’ claims, not least their clever way of adopting memes to try and rubbish Rishi Sunak’s policy of national service. “Meanwhile, for someone meant to be tech-savvy, Sunak’s TikTok presence has been pretty pathetic: not only are the videos pretty soulless and lifeless, but they seem to ignore the fact you have to grab viewers’ attention right from the off, instead going ponderously through the Tories’ lines to take on various policies.” Mr Sunak’s national service pledge has become fodder for memes on Labour’s page. Another similarly popular clip depicts “Rishi Sunak turning up on your 18th birthday to send you to war”, with a viral video of late TV host Cilla Black singing her 1980s track “Surprise Surprise” on the show of the same name. While the Conservatives’ first post received over 1.2 million views, it received 85,000 likes and over 10,000 comments as Mr Sunak asked for questions about the national service policy. Those questions included “what if I wanted to go to university” and “who is paying me to do it?” In response to that second question, a follow-up video on Monday saw Mr Sunak explain the Government would “provide a stipend to help with living costs” for those joining the military and provide “funding for training and administration” for community work. Although it is early days – the Conservatives had shared just four TikToks by Monday afternoon to Labour’s 25 – the approach by Sir Keir Starmer’s party has been more successful. Labour has more than 43,000 TikTok followers to the Convervatives’ 13,000 and they have received over 10 times more likes on the platform – with more than 930,000 to 87,000 for the Tories. “It’s clear that for younger users the Labour campaign’s use of TikTok is more likely to be a more natural fit but, actually, I think you’ll find that it cuts through to older voters, too,” said Mr Stokel-Walker. “A lot of the memes that Labour have used so far, particularly around the national service policy, are ones that people who spend any time on Facebook, X or even a family WhatsApp group will recognise – and probably laugh at. “We’ve heard for more than a decade now that every general election is the ‘first social media election’, but there’s no doubt that online campaigning will be important to get the message out to voters – particularly younger ones.” TikTok was banned from Government devices over fears about how information such as contacts, user content and geolocation data could be used by the company’s Beijing-based owner ByteDance. In the announcement of the ban in March 2023, then Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Oliver Dowden described the decision as a “prudent and proportionate step following advice from our cyber security experts”.",

Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Federal Territories) Dr Zaliha Mustafa said these issues were discussed during the Federal Territories State Security Working Committee Meeting No.1/2024 in Kuala Lumpur today, marking the first such meeting since 2020. “The meeting primarily focused on various security and public order issues, including IMM13 in Labuan and the dumping of foreign immigrants,” she said in a statement tonight. The IMM13 is a document issued to Filipino citizens with refugee status in Sabah and Labuan. Dr Zaliha also highlighted the issue of illegal settlements by Rohingya people in Bandar Baru Sentul, which has gone viral on social media and assured this matter would be addressed immediately. Dr Zaliha also announced the establishment of a special unit, the KL Strike Force, which would operate in an integrated manner with the involvement of the Royal Malaysian Police, Immigration Department, Kuala Lumpur City Hall, the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Cost of Living and the Royal Malaysian Customs Department. She said the unit would tackle security issues, including those involving street traders, hawkers, small traders, beggars, homeless people, and other current matters threatening public safety and order in the Federal Territory. “This concerted enforcement will commence immediately in hotspot areas, including swift action on viral posts on social media,” Dr Zaliha said. — Bernama",

        "content": "WHOEVER thought belonging to the PLU/NRM means immunity to police action should visit Jinja City where close to 100 youth are in tears after suffering a double blow following the destruction of their kiosks. The stingy issue which has dominated mainstream and social media platforms in the last few weeks came to its climax at dawn on Monday 27th May, 2024 when armed police personnel supervised the destruction of the kiosks by hired body-built youth, commonly known as kanyamas. Some of the group members Abubaker Terikya popularly known as Pius accused the police of being unpatriotic and greedy by always pocketing money from unscrupulous tycoons to execute shoddy deals. “...their intention is to discourage and weaken NRM/PLU in Jinja so that opposition takes over for them to get more operational funds from the government...”Terikya roared. Without divulging details on the next step, Terikya says the battle has just begun and that they will come out with a loud statement after making consultations with relevant friendly and influential partners. The other members Ngobi Kowa, Shaban Nabongo and Nsamba Abu Karim who were literally in tears had no kind words for the RCC Darius Naninda whom they describe as ‘money hungry’ and practices double standards. They cited the recent saga when a group of Muslims constructed an illegal perimeter wall at the land belonging to the Jinja Regional Referral Hospital with the full backing of the City Security Committee. “...the perimeter wall is still standing up to now because the RCC got money from some people, now our kiosks are no more because the same RCC also got money from some business people...”,they charged. The RCC Darius Naninda hits back saying no amount of blackmail and intimidation will derail him from executing his duties and dismisses the group as non-starters opposition elements recruited by FDC’s Bernard Mbayo who is the Jinja City Council Speaker. The destruction was greeted with joy from Jinja Mayor Alton Peter Kasolo, Jinja East Councilor Richard Mbazira and some big businessmen who welcome the move as the direction towards the restoration of sanity in Jinja. “...belonging to NRM/LPU is nothing as far as we are concerned, the most important thing is to abide by the laws and regulations of the land, otherwise we shall be encouraging impunity in the city...”,Kasolo had repeatedly made his position clear on various platforms including local radio stations. The plumpy Richard Mbazira who is planning to upstage Hon Nathan Samson Igeme Nabeta ahead of 2026 says his main concern is that trade order must be respected by everyone. Saying his aspirations to go to the 12 Parliament in 2026 is on course and that people who are using the kiosk saga to de-campaign him are merely wasting time because he will trounce Igeme with a very comfortable margin. Witnesses said the kiosks were literally reduced to scraps in the operation which started shortly around 3am when the armed police of Field Force Unit (FFU) alongside the regular personnel cordoned off the rectangular area for more than three hours. It’s not yet clear who ordered the operation since the Town Clerk Edward Lwanga was not around town but even the Deputy Town Clerk Peter Mawerere who was at the station declined to comment. “...I have no comment...”,was the blunt four-word comment that Peter Mawerere uttered in a 30 second telephone interview with this reporter before hanging up. Other officials including the Jinja City Council mouthpiece Rajab Kitto did not answer our calls despite repeated calls, and some people suggested he could have been trapped in the usual traffic jam always experienced during the reopening of school terms. However, the police were quick to deny any involvement saying they only offered security following requests from the Jinja City authorities who are the owners of the land in question. Some people alleged the operation was fully sponsored by a section of businessmen who feared the presence of the kiosks in the area would affect their profit margins. It’s not clear why the operation was conducted at night if indeed they were implementing the Trade Order. Questions are also being asked why the kiosks were destroyed, yet the owners used at least 5M/= each to fabricate and install them at the disputed site. Some analysts described the kiosk saga as a “very complicated political war” with different frontlines ‘romancing’ with jealousy, revenge, ego, money and power, all hiding under the Trade Order.",

        "content": "Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) leaders and New York City Mayor Eric Adams are reportedly meeting at the negotiating table on how to amend the city’s strict sanctuary laws. Ken Genalo, the New York City regional field director for ICE, said his agency has been making progress with Adams’ office on how to work around sanctuary laws that bar local law enforcement from cooperating with his staff, according to from the New York Post. Adams has shown a public willingness to change the city’s anti-ICE laws in the wake of a massive influx of illegal immigrants since the beginning of the border crisis. “I’ve been working with the mayor’s office, I have had dialogue with them,” Genalo said to The Post. “I give them kudos — the prior administration under Mr. de Blasio ... there was no dialogue at all.” “With Mayor Adams’ office, we’ve had numerous dialogues,” Genalo continued. “At least we’re back at the table and speaking with one another again.” New York City, the most populous city in the country and a bastion of liberal politics, has long had sanctuary laws on the books. NEW YORK, NEW YORK – JUNE 6: An ICE agent monitors hundreds of asylum seekers being processed upon entering the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building on June 6, 2023 in New York City. (Photo by David Dee Delgado/Getty Images) Former Mayor Bill de Blasio in 2014 a bill that largely prohibits the New York Police Department from working with federal immigration authorities, and he in 2018 that doubled down on this policy. While there is no official definition of “sanctuary city,” the Big Apple is placed on the Center for Immigration Studies of sanctuary jurisdictions for its anti-ICE laws. However, these laws have come into question as New York City continues to bear the brunt of the ongoing illegal immigration crisis. New York City has accepted around 160,000 asylum seekers April 2022, forcing leaders to make substantial budget cuts in order to deal with the burden. Last year, Adams sweeping cuts for government services in order to pay for the incoming illegal immigrants taking residence in the city, and at the time said the city was reaching a “breaking point” from the sheer volume of migrants. Clashes between ICE and New York City leaders came to a recent head when the agency local authorities for ignoring their detainer request against an illegal immigrant accused of beating up an NYPD officer. The issue of detainer requests is of particular importance for federal immigration authorities working in New York City. Genalo told the Post that he desperately wants to see the city change its policy so local law enforcement can more frequently honor ICE detainer requests, allowing deportation officers enough time to make an apprehension at a local detention facility instead of having to locate dangerous criminal illegal immigrants out in the community. Adams, for his part, has been coming around to the idea of more cooperation with ICE. In February, he said migrants charged with major crimes to be handed over to federal immigration authorities. However, it’s not immediately clear what the talks between ICE and Adams will produce. “I wish progress would come faster,” Genalo told the Post. “But at least I can say there has been progress.” All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

One of the legal notices, sent by Delhi-based law firm Rizwan Law Associates on behalf of the cricketer, has sought “adequate damages in terms of delay caused in completion of the Project and issuance of the Letter of Possession in the absence of any reasonable cause or extension in timeline.” It has also sought “delivery of proper quality, standard, class and grade of the Apartment to My Client who was promised a premium quality Apartment and has been offered an extremely inferior quality Apartment.” According to the notice, the cricketer had booked a dwelling unit in 2020 at Hauz Khas, New Delhi in one of the projects of a real estate firm. M/s Brilliant Etoile Private Limited and M/s Uppal Housing Private Limited are the noticees in one of the legal notices pertaining to the delayed possession of the dwelling units. The second notice of the cricketer was issued to Brilliant Etoile Private Limited only and it pertained to infringement of his privacy rights. “That this dispute principally concerns with the violation of Intellectual Property Rights with respect to the Personality Rights and misuse of Brand Value of the Celebrity i.E., My Client in contravention to the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding dated 24.11.2020, however, My Client reserves the right to add the detailed instances and elaborate in further specificity in the Statement of Claim,” the second notice said. According to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), the cricketer was to promote and endorse the project and the MoU expired on November 23, 2023. He is aggrieved by the alleged continued commercial use of the services provided by him, including the use of his photographs on billboards, project site, social media posts, and articles despite the expiry of the MoU, the notice said. The former India all-rounder said the alleged continued use of his image and others was in complete violation of his Copyright, Personality Rights, and Right to Publicity enshrined under the laws and protected as his Intellectual Property Rights.",

        "content": "A George woman, accused of assault, earning a living off prostitution and running a brothel, made a brief appearance on Monday in the George Magistrate’s Court, where her bail application was postponed for an interpreter to be arranged. The 39-year-old, who cannot be named until she has pleaded to the charges, was arrested by the serious organised crime investigation unit of the Hawks on Saturday. The arrest came after members of the Hawks, who had been monitoring the alleged brothel for some time, raided the building along with SAPS visible policing members. According to the police, a victim, allegedly held against her will, was found at the suspected brothel. The complainant was taken to George Regional Hospital for a medical examination, after which she was taken to a place of safety. The case was postponed to Thursday to allow for the accused to appoint a lawyer, and for a Shona interpreter to be engaged. HeraldLIVE Would you like to comment on this article?

The Head of TikTok LIVE, Middle East, Turkey, Africa and Pakistan, Waseem Sayegh, said, “We believe these updates will empower our LIVE community’s creativity while helping ensure our features promote the positive interactions they’re intended for. “The vast majority of LIVE creators already follow our safety rules and Monetization Guidelines, and we’ll continue to build resources, moderation processes and tools that can help them foster safe, inclusive and authentic LIVE communities.” In addition, TikTok launched a new LIVE Safety Center resource and updated its in-app LIVE Safety Education Center, where creators can view policy violations and educational content. TikTok has some of the industry’s strictest live streaming requirements, with creators required to be at least 18 years old and meet additional criteria to go live.",

        "description": "The Electoral Commission of SA is contemplating legal action against the uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) Party after a group of its supporters allegedly invaded an IEC storage facility and threatened an elections official over the weekend.",
        "content": "The Electoral Commission of SA (IEC) is contemplating legal action against the uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) Party after a group of its supporters allegedly invaded an IEC storage facility and threatened an elections official over the weekend. The IEC moved swiftly on Sunday to stamp out disinformation MK Party members had allegedly spread about a normal logistics procedure at a storage facility in Hammarsdale, Mpumalanga, which supporters had \"overrun\" and had begun \"interfering\" in an \"unauthorised and unlawful manner\". This came as the electoral commission prepared for the first special votes to be cast in the country on Monday and Tuesday. An analyst has warned that the MK Party, led by former president Jacob Zuma, has shown that its central method of campaigning is through misdeeds, such as this, and that there may be further attempts to disrupt the polls on Wednesday. The IEC revealed that the MK Party had taken videos of the material stored at the site over the weekend. But it said the storage facility was part of a regular logistics exercise. Ballots are transported there to be closer to voting stations to ensure they can reach voting stations quickly on election day and that the voting stations can open on time. They are heavily guarded, including when they are transported. It is unclear how the MK Party supporters managed to \"overrun\" the facility, despite the security measures in place to protect it. ROLLING COVERAGE | Elections 2024: Anticipation builds as all stations prep for voters making their mark An IEC official in eThekwini was also \"accosted\" by MK Party supporters over the weekend in the middle of the night at their private residence and questioned about a similar storage facility nearby. IEC deputy chief electoral officer Masego Sheburi said there would be \"repercussions\" for the invasion of the storage facility and threats to its staff. The commission was dealing with the matter along with the SA Police and would be able to provide further details at its next media briefing. In a statement on Sunday, the IEC said: President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the nation on Sunday and expressed concern about the incident. He called on parties, candidates, supporters and all citizens to \"refrain from any action that could interfere\" with the electoral process. He also expressed confidence in the IEC's ability to run a free and fair election and commended the commission for its \"impressive work\" in preparing for the polls. More than 1.6 million South Africans are voting on Monday and Tuesday. They are those who applied for special votes, which include voting at stations as well as home visits by electoral commission officers. The polls open for the rest of the country on Wednesday. Also on Sunday, police deputy commissioner and National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure (Natjoints) co-chairperson Lieutenant General Tebello Mosikili told journalists that the country's security apparatus was taking seriously warnings that private companies, such as FirstRand and Fidelity, had issued about potential protests by the MK Party during and in the aftermath of the elections. \"Yes, we are aware of such. We have put plans in place... should this be executed, we will rise to the occasion... we are not saying that it will not happen, we are saying we have plans in place and we will respond accordingly,\" she said. Police visibility is set to be increased across the country. In a tacit reference claims on social media that the electoral body was preparing to \"rig elections\" in favour of the ANC, Mosikili warned that spreading fake news and incitement on any platform would \"not be tolerated\". \"Our intelligence communities and cybercrime units are closely monitoring online users. You are warned not to step out of line,\" she said. Supporters of Zuma, including his daughter Duduzile Sambudla-Zuma, used social media to support various acts of violence and looting during the 2021 riots, which led to the death of more than 300 people and caused losses to the economy to the tune of billions of rands. On Sunday, Sambudla-Zuma began circulating footage of the IEC storage facility, with the narrative that the motive for storing election material was nefarious - which the electoral commission dismissed as false. Electoral analyst at the Electoral Institute of SA (EISA) Ebrahim Fakir, said the MK Party thrived on such situations because they give the party \"oxygen\". \"They have no other legitimate way of campaigning. It is the same modus operandi we saw before the July 2021 unrest. This political project has little to do with ideology or even politics, it is simply a spoiler party,\" he said. Fakir said Zuma and the MK Party were fighting tooth and nail to remain relevant and were aware that if Zuma went to jail, those implicated in corruption and state capture would be at risk of jail time too. ALSO READ | Zuma will remain the 'brains' behind any deployment, says MK Party after ConCourt blow These supporters of MK, he added, also have an interest in ensuring that Ramaphosa's clean-up project - which has started shifting the corruption needle nationally - does not impact them locally. \"Ramaphosa's sort of clean-up nationally has seen the eating displaced to the local level where it is more concentrated and intense. Many Zuma supporters are now accessing state largesse at that level and they are worried that once Ramaphosa wins an election with a strong hand, you have a relatively coherent ANC, that clean-up happening at the national level will start filtering down to the provinces and the local level,\" he said. Fakir also stressed that the MK Party was unlikely to do well nationally, ending on around 4%, but would seek to do as much damage as possible in other ways. \"Their whole project is to disrupt, any stability for them spells disaster. Society has to stop giving oxygen to this,\" he said. He added that it was interesting that Zuma was happily contesting the elections and that his key backers faced little repercussions over the July 2021 riots, despite the many families affected by the deaths and the ensuing economic damage.",

        "content": "They traveled from all over — from Europe and Oceania, from North America and South America — to be at Roland Garros on Monday, intent on watching Rafael Nadal play what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. Related video above: Rafael Nadal's French Open farewell leaves gaping hole that tennis has failed to prepare for Nadal, who has won 14 of his 22 Grand Slam trophies in Paris, was scheduled to play on Day 2 of the tournament on Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev, and tennis fans wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. \"He's my favorite tennis player. Maybe when he retires, I will find someone new. But I don't know if I will give that much love to the next one,\" said Fiona Li, a 35-year-old who works in luxury fashion in the Netherlands. \"His power is that he never gives up. He encourages me when I am really down. He fights until the last minute. That's what we need in daily life. When you're sad or something, you watch him play, and everything is solved.\" Li, who said she's been a Nadal fan since 2005, the year he won his first title at Roland Garros as a teenager, made sure to stop by the 3-meter-tall (about 10-feet-tall) statue of Nadal that was unveiled in 2021 and stands between one of the tournament's main entrances and the 15,000-seat Chatrier stadium. Wearing a makeshift tiara fashioned from four yellow tennis balls — each with a letter to spell out \"Rafa\" — Li posed for photos in front of the statue with three pals, one from Australia and two from China. Each member of the quartet wore a red T-shirt with a capital yellow letter from his first name. One held a red-and-yellow Spanish flag with \"King of Roland Garros\" stamped on it. \"Vamos, Rafa!\" they shouted in unison. Nadal turns 38 on June 3 and had indicated, amid a series of injuries to his hip and an abdominal muscle, that he would be retiring at some point in 2024. When told by a reporter on Saturday that most folks are assuming this will be his French Open adieu, he smiled and said: \"Don't assume.\" So who knows what the future holds? The whole thing has a bit of the same vibe as at the 2022 U.S. Open when the world was well aware that Serena Williams was participating in what would be her last event, and she was feted by enthusiastic crowds. Similarly, plenty of people yearned to soak up the atmosphere and get as close as possible to Nadal, or even just symbols of Nadal — whether by visiting that larger-than-life steel monument to him or catching a peek of a practice or buying merchandise. The main on-site store has a special section of its main floor with Nadal-branded items, including an array of hats that come in six colors and go for 35 euros each (about $38). Even Julio Parada, a 49-year-old Bolivian in banking, wanted a photo at the statue — while wearing a green hat with \"RF\" on it, representing Roger Federer. \"I like both. Actually, I prefer Roger, but Rafa was the most difficult rival he ever faced,\" said Parada, attending his first Grand Slam tournament with his wife, Karina, and son, Julio, who is a student in Germany. \"We made the effort to see Nadal, because we are aware that this is maybe his last French Open.\" Also holding tickets for Nadal vs. Zverev was Barbra Chambati, 49, and her daughter, Crystal, 25. Mom wore a salmon-colored top with Nadal's bull horns logo. Crystal had on a white T-shirt — bought two days ago on the Champs-Élysées avenue — showing a photo of Nadal pumping his fist. They tried to watch a training session at Court 3 a few hours before Monday's match, but could not get in because it was too crowded. Still, it was a thrill simply to see him walk past afterward. \"He has a lot of money, but you wouldn't know it because of his humility. He relates to anyone,\" said Barbra Chambati, a food factory manager who said she is originally from Zimbabwe and has lived in New Zealand for two decades. \"We are so grateful that, for so many years, he has given his all for our enjoyment.\" Their trip included a 17-hour flight from Auckland to Dubai, a stopover, and a 7-hour flight from Dubai to Paris. \"A bit long, but worth it,\" Barbra Chambati said. \"We wouldn't change it for anything.\" They were part of a tennis tour group that included Cathy Davis, a 75-year-old retiree from Toronto, who was wearing a purple hat with the bull logo. She proclaimed herself a \"Rafa supreme fan.\" Why? \"He's a shot-maker. I love the overhead smash; he's the king of that. His down-the-line forehand. Cross-court backhand. And now he comes to the net,\" Davis said. \"On the court, intensity-plus. Off it, very humble. Kind. He's one thing on the court and someone a little bit different off.\" As with Williams a little less than two years ago in New York, no one knows for sure how long Nadal will remain in the draw over these two weeks. Li, for one, was prepared. She said she purchased tickets for the full event. \"No matter how far he goes,\" she said, \"I will be there.\"",

        "content": "Payment of parking fees in the city-wide Bratislava Parking Assistant System (PAAS) scheme by text messages should be launched at the turn of May and June, Bratislava’s spokesman Peter Bubla told the TASR newswire. The service will be provided by Mediatex, winner of a tender. A total of three companies enrolled. “The technical introduction of the text message’s service is currently underway,” said Bubla. This payment method will extend the range of possible payments paths for parking fees in the scheme. Originally the municipality did not plan to introduce this method as it considered it too complicated and expensive within the PAAS scheme. But as locals and visitors are used to this payment method from other Slovak and European cities, it resolved to add it to the existing methods. The payment of the parking fees by text messages (SMS) was enabled by a regulation approved by the Bratislava city council at the end of May last year. Mobile parking apps are the most frequent form of payment of parking fees in Bratislava, with 79 percent of fees paid in April. A further 20 percent were paid via parking meters, with the remaining share paid at contracted outlets and assistants. The Bratislava Parking Assistant System , which the Bratislava municipality describes as one of the biggest reforms in the capital city, was launched in the first three zones at the beginning of 2022. The system is gradually being expanded by the city.",

        "content": "The Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi (SAN) on Monday, charged the ECOWAS Judicial Council to initiate a reform-oriented review of the practice and procedure of the ECOWAS Court of Justice to avoid conflicts with national courts and to make the court realise envisioned potential as a respectable regional court. Fagbemi who stated this in Abuja, while addressing the opening ceremony of the Statutory Meeting of the ECOWAS Judicial Council said, the Council should also provide credible network for promotion of uniform rules of practice and procedure in the administration of justice in order to reduce conflict of laws in the region. He said , the ECOWAS Judicial Council stands in a proper position to work towards the promotion of rule of law and democratic governance, which has come under intense pressure in recent times. “The judiciary should rise to the occasion in helping to stem the factors that precipitate military incursion into governance. The process of adherence to conduct of free and fair elections and constitutional governance must be protected”. According to the Chief Law Officer of the Federation, as the ECOWAS block continues to work towards achieving uniform economic policies and institutions, the judiciary should not be left behind. Fagbemi also said the challenges confronting the judiciary or the justice system in general across the West African states are identical in terms of judicial autonomy, provision of funding, and infrastructural facilities for the courts , among others . In the same vein, he said, member States also share the challenges confronting the region in terms of economy, migration, integration, insecurity, enforcement of fundamental rights, etc. The AGF enjoined the ECOWAS Judicial Council to utilise the regional platform, as an avenue for peer review and cross-fertilisation of ideas, to address the issues in order to achieve greater independence of the judiciary and a more prosperous and safer sub-region.

        "content": "The Indian junior women's hockey team lost 4-6 to Germany in its fifth match of their tour of Europe on Monday. However, after conceding six goals, India rallied to score four goals and asserted themselves in the second half of the match. Sanjana Horo, Bhinima Dan and Kanika Siwach scored for India. Like their previous match, Germany scored early in the first quarter and doubled their lead soon after. Despite trailing, the Indian defence did well to successfully defend multiple penalty corners. In the final minutes of the first quarter, India won a penalty corner but the scoreline remained 2-0, in favour of Germany. India began the second quarter on a positive note but failed to find the back of the opposition net. Germany struck their third goal soon to put themselves in a dominant position at half-time. Germany continued to assert themselves in the third quarter, scoring thrice, including a successful penalty corner conversion to take a commanding 6-0 lead. But India fought back and scored their first goal when Sanjana Horo sounded the board late in the quarter. India turned up the pressure on Germany in the final quarter. Sanjana Horo scored India's second goal before Binima Dhan and Kanika Siwach found the opposition net to reduce the margin to 4-6. On Sunday, the Indians lost 0-1 to Germany in their fourth match. India had a challenging first quarter as Germany broke the deadlock early match to take a 1-0 lead. A goalless second and third quarter unfolded, ensuring Germany stayed ahead, even as India worked hard to score an equalizer. In the final quarter, Germany nearly doubled their lead, but their penalty stroke was denied by India's goalkeeper. With minutes left on the clock, India's final opportunity of the match came in the form of a penalty corner, but they failed to convert it and conceded a 0-1 defeat to Germany. India will play their next match against Dutch club side Oranje Rood in Breda, Netherlands on May 29.",

        "description": "WASHINGTON, United States (CMC) — The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has urged countries of Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean to strengthen preventive measures against this disease.In an epidemiological alert issued on Friday, PAHO pointed to the importance of strengthening surveillance, diagnosis and vector control actions, as well as preparing health services for the proper management of patients.“The aim is to prevent complications and avoid possible overcrowding of health services,” said PAHO, noting that dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that, in most cases, has no symptoms.“However, when symptoms do occur, they usually include high fever, headache, body aches, nausea and rash,” it added. “Although most people recover within one to two weeks, some can develop severe forms that require hospitalisation. These can be fatal when not treated promptly and properly.”As of mid-May 2024, PAHO said the Americas region, including the Caribbean, has reported more than 8.1 million suspected cases of dengue, marking a 3.3-fold increase compared to the same period last year.The countries with the highest number of reported cases are Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Peru, Colombia and Mexico, while more than 3,600 dengue-related deaths have been reported throughout the region.Meanwhile, PAHO said countries and territories in the Caribbean have reported over 21,000 cases, representing a 5.7-fold increase compared to the corresponding period last year.Faced with this unprecedented regional increase in dengue cases, PAHO urged countries to intensify efforts to combat the mosquito vector and the disease, for which there is no specific treatment.In the epidemiological alert, PAHO emphasises the importance of timely clinical diagnosis, early identification of warning signs, and proper management of patients to avoid serious cases and deaths.The health organisation also called on health care workers to provide clear guidance to patients and their families to monitor warning signs, and seek immediate medical attention in the event of any of these signs.PAHO said it offers resources and training through its virtual course on dengue, available free of charge on its Virtual Campus for Public Health.The health body also recommended that member states make effective use of available resources to prevent and/or control vector infestations in affected areas and health services.It reminded the population of the importance of eliminating mosquito breeding sites in their homes and surroundings, and to take precautions to avoid bites, such as the use of repellent and clothing that covers the arms and legs.PAHO reiterated its commitment to support countries in the implementation of effective measures in the fight against dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases, and said it will continue to monitor the situation and provide technical guidance to affected countries.",

        "content": "-- Shares Facebook Twitter Reddit Email A new clip from Investigation Discovery's upcoming docuseries, \"Fallen Idols: Nick and Aaron Carter,\" shows one of the women who has accused Backstreet Boys It boy Nick Carter of sexual assault explaining her decision to come forward about her reported experience. Melissa Schuman, former member of the late '90s and early-aughts pop girl group Dream is featured as a key participant of \"Fallen Idols,\" which runs as a four-part docuseries over two nights this Memorial Day. In 2017, around the height of the #MeToo movement, Schuman published a blog post claiming that Carter had raped her at his apartment in Santa Monica in 2003. At the time, Schuman and Carter had been cast in a movie together. In the \"Fallen Idols\" footage, Schuman shares how she decided to chronicle the details of the alleged assault on her computer, at first electing to not publish it. But eventually, she does, and the fallout is not what she expected. In addition to investigating the allegations against Nick Carter, \"Fallen Idols\" will also examine younger brother Aaron Carter's struggles with mental health and substance abuse, as well as the Carter family's reportedly strained dynamic. \"Fallen Idols\" airs on ID and streams on Max on Monday, May 27 and Tuesday, May 28.

        "description": "Powerful storms have killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas",
        "content": "Powerful storms have killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central US The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas. On Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City. Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference Sunday. The dead included two children, ages two and five. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff. Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county's emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. Three people have died in Kentucky. Gov. Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early Monday in a post on social media platform X, citing \"multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes.\" The small community of Charleston took a direct hit from the storm Sunday night, where several homes were destroyed and utilities were knocked out. \"It's a big mess,\" said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs. \"Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever - no water, no power.\" Charleston is an unincorporated community two miles north of Dawson Spring, which was devastated by a tornado in late 2021. Beshear's father, former two-term Gov. Steve Beshear, grew up in Dawson Springs. In Texas, about 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, Abbott said, sitting in front of a ravaged truck stop near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest hit, with winds reaching an estimated 217 kph, officials said. \"The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,\" said Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts of severe weather, including storms that killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. Abbot signed an amended severe weather disaster declaration on Sunday to include Denton, Montague, Cooke and Collin on a list of counties already under a disaster declaration sparked by storms and flooding in late April. Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot. \"A firefighter came to check on us and he said, 'You're very lucky,'\" Parra said. \"The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.\" Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas. The destruction continued a grim month of deadly severe weather in the nation's midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Meteorologists and authorities issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region late Saturday and into Sunday. \"If you are in the path of this storm take cover now!\" the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma, posted on X. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months.",

        "content": "Powerful storms have killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central US The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas. On Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City. Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference Sunday. The dead included two children, ages two and five. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff. Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county's emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. Three people have died in Kentucky. Gov. Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early Monday in a post on social media platform X, citing \"multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes.\" The small community of Charleston took a direct hit from the storm Sunday night, where several homes were destroyed and utilities were knocked out. \"It's a big mess,\" said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs. \"Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever - no water, no power.\" Charleston is an unincorporated community two miles north of Dawson Spring, which was devastated by a tornado in late 2021. Beshear's father, former two-term Gov. Steve Beshear, grew up in Dawson Springs. In Texas, about 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, Abbott said, sitting in front of a ravaged truck stop near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest hit, with winds reaching an estimated 217 kph, officials said. \"The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,\" said Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts of severe weather, including storms that killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. Abbot signed an amended severe weather disaster declaration on Sunday to include Denton, Montague, Cooke and Collin on a list of counties already under a disaster declaration sparked by storms and flooding in late April. Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot. \"A firefighter came to check on us and he said, 'You're very lucky,'\" Parra said. \"The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.\" Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas. The destruction continued a grim month of deadly severe weather in the nation's midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Meteorologists and authorities issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region late Saturday and into Sunday. \"If you are in the path of this storm take cover now!\" the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma, posted on X. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months.",

        "content": "MONTREAL — A judge has granted Université du Québec à Montréal a partial injunction against pro-Palestinian protesters who set up an encampment on its downtown campus earlier this month. Superior Court Justice Louis J. Gouin says safety measures need to be put in place urgently at the encampment, and that doing so won't infringe on the encampment members' right to protest. Gouin is prohibiting protesters from setting up tents and other material within two metres of campus buildings, instead of the three metres UQAM had requested. Protesters have also been ordered to ensure doors, windows and walls are clear of obstructions; to remove the cardboard blocking security cameras; and to allow representatives from the school and fire department to visit the camp to make sure it's safe. UQAM had argued that protesters are posing a safety risk by blocking an emergency exit, being in possession of gasoline canisters and iron bars, and potentially \"overloading\" the university's electrical network with unauthorized extension cords. Since the encampment started on May 12, protesters have demanded that the university cut ties with Israeli institutions and disclose its links to Israel, and that the Quebec government cancel plans for a diplomatic office in the country.

Ciidamada difaaca Israa’iil (IDF) ayaa sheegay in sideed gantaal laga soo tuuray deegaanka Rafah, “tiro gantaallo ahna la qabtay. Xamaas ayaa sheegatay mas’uuliyadda weerarka. Dadka dhintay iyo kuwa dhaawacmay ayaa u badan haween iyo carruur sida ay sheegtay wasaaradda caafimaadka ee Gaza iyadoo intaas ku dartay in isbitaal ku yaalla Rafah uusan awood u lahayn inuu qaado tirada dhaawacyada. Bisha cas ee Falastiin waxay sheegtay in shaqaalaheeda ambalaasta ay daabulayeen dad aad u badan ka dib weerarka. Guddiga Gurmadka degdega ah ee Falastiiniyiinta ee Rafah ayaa sheegay in tobanaan qof lagu dilay weerarka teendhooyinka markii uu dabku ka kacay. Fiidiyowga ay ayaa muujinaya dhismayaal teendho u eg oo gubanaya. Xamaas waxay ku tilmaantay weerarka mid “xasuuq” ah oo ay sheegtay in ay si gaar ah ugala xisaabtamayaan maamulka Maraykanka iyo madaxweyne Joe Biden. Waxa ay sheegtay in Israa’iil aysan qaadi lahayn weerarada “haddii aysan jirin taageero Mareykan ah, inkastoo ay buux dhaafiyeen muwaadiniin barakacayaal ah”. Xamaas ayaa ku baaqday faragelin degdeg ah oo caalami ah. Dhakhaatiirta aan xuduuda lahayn, oo sidoo kale loo yaqaan Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), ayaa muujiyay cabsida ay ka duqeymaha aan loo meel dayin “Waxay tusinaysaa mar kale in aysan jirin meel nabdoon.” ayaa lagu yiri war ay soo saartay MSF Madaxtooyada maamulka Falastiin ayaa ku boorisay beesha caalamka inay si deg deg ah u soo farageliyaan waxa uu ugu yeeray dambiyada ka dhanka ah shacabka Falastiin. Duqeynta Rafah ayaa ku soo beegantay maalmo kadib markii maxkamadda caalamiga ah ee cadaaladda ay amartay Israa’iil inay joojiso duullaanka ay ku hayso Rafah. Maxkamaddu waxay u aragtaa xaaladda bini’aadantinimo ee magaalada in lagu sifeeyay “musiibo,” ayuu yiri madaxweynaha ICJ, isagoo intaas ku daray in saraakiisha Qaramada Midoobay ay muujiyeen in xaaladdu ay ka sii dari doonto “Haddii howlgalka Israa’iil ee Rafah uu sii socdo.

New Delhi: The Supreme Court has said that the commitments made by political parties in their manifestos will not amount to corrupt practice under the election laws. A bench comprising Justice Surya Kant and Justice KV Viswanathan rejected the submission of a voter from the Chamrajpet Assembly Constituency in Karnataka that the commitments by a political party in its manifesto, which eventually lead to direct or indirect financial help to the public at large, will also amount to corrupt practice by a candidate of that party. Apex court dismissed election petition The apex court bench, while dismissing an election petition against the election of Indian National Congress (INC) candidate in Karnataka, said, “The contention of the learned counsel that the commitments by a political party in its manifesto, which eventually lead to direct or indirect financial help to the public at large, will also amount to corrupt practice by a candidate of that party, is too far-fetched and cannot be accepted.” The apex court was hearing an appeal against an order of the Karnataka High Court dismissing an election petition filed by petitioner, Shashanka J Sreedhara, who is a voter from the Chamrajpet Assembly constituency, against BZ Zameer Ahmed Khan, winning candidate of the Indian National Congress (INC). Commitments made by INC for Karnataka assembly polls amounted to corrupt electoral practice: Petitioner The petitioner alleged that commitments made by the Indian National Congress in its election manifesto for the 2023 Karnataka assembly polls were direct and indirect financial help to the public which amounted to corrupt electoral practice and that the five guarantees made by the Indian National Congress party in its manifesto amounts to corrupt practice. “In any case, in the facts and circumstances of these cases, we need not to go into such question elaborately. The appeals are, accordingly, dismissed,” the apex court said. ‘Five guarantees’ of INC promised in manifesto in assembly election not corrupt practices, Karnataka HC earlier held The Karnataka High Court earlier rejected the election petition, holding that the “five guarantees” of the Indian National Congress promised in its manifesto during the Karnataka assembly elections have to be considered as social welfare policies and cannot be termed as corrupt practices under the Representation of Peoples (RP) Act. It had further said that whether they are financially viable or not is altogether a different aspect and it may be termed as wrong policies but not corrupt practices under the RP Act.",

        "content": "People in Pune continue to rage over the 17-year-old boy, son of renowned real estate developer Vishal Agarwal, who, allegedly, under the influence of alcohol, ran over two bike-borne IT professionals with his speeding unregistered Porsche Taycan on May 19. The accused was earlier released on bail and was asked to write a 300-word essay. To protest against the lenient punishment doled out to the Pune Porsche crash accused, an essay-writing competition was organised in the city, on Sunday, in which around 100 people took part. Venue of essay-writing competition The venue of the essay-writing competition was the spot in Kalyani Nagar where the accident took place on May 19. Topics of essay-writing competition According to a report by The Hindu , there were around 10 topics for the essay-writing competition, which included – 1 - What would I have done if my father was a builder 2 - What would I do if I became a policeman 3 - Ill effects of alcohol 4 - My favourite car 5 - The law is the same for all 6 - Is this administration sleeping? 7 - Today’s youth and their relation to addiction 8 - How to build better roads to avoid accidents 9 - Does India have equality in law 10 - My ideal Pune city Winning prize Cash prizes were announced for the three best essays — Rs 11,000, Rs 7,000 and Rs 5,000. Who had organised the essay-writing competition in Pune? According to a report by the Times of India , the essay-writing competition was the brainchild of social worker Changdeo Gite, who said he wished to highlight what many are calling the ‘preferential treatment’ of the boy accused in Pune Porsche accident case. Essay-writing competition ‘my way of protesting’ “The issue is serious and it is ridiculous that one bail condition was to write a 300-word essay after taking the life of two people. I can’t fight this in court, but I wanted to highlight the injustice. The essay-writing competition is my way of protesting,\" Gite was quoted as saying by ToI . As per the report, participants of the essay-writing competition were grown adults between 30-40 years of, with only two or three under the age of 18. Several civil service aspirants and students also took part. The essays were reviewed by a panel of five judges who will now choose a winner. With essays from multiple writers to vet, no decision was made on Sunday. The chief guest for the event was Kasba Peth MLA and Congress Lok Sabha elections candidate Ravindra Dhangekar.",

        "description": "In a bid to avoid angering Tehran",
        "content": "The Biden administration is asking its European allies not to confront Iran on its nuclear program ahead of the U.S. elections in November, several diplomats involved in negotiations told The Wall Street Journal. The U.S. and the West at large have become increasingly about Iran’s rapidly growing nuclear program, its potential to weaponize such capabilities and its stubbornness toward international oversight. In a bid to avoid angering Tehran, the Biden administration is urging against efforts led by France and Britain to censure Iran at the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) member-state board meeting in June, saying that the U.S. will abstain from the motion, the diplomats the WSJ. Some diplomats have expressed fears that if action isn’t taken, it could undermine the IAEA’s credibility and risk weakening the West’s leverage over Tehran, according to the WSJ. A number of them have become frustrated that the Biden administration has hamstrung their attempts to contain Iran’s nuclear program and failed to pursue a stronger policy in dealing with Tehran. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken (L) meets with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi (R) at Vienna International Centre, in Vienna, Austria March 15, 2024. (Photo by Evelyn Hockstein / POOL / AFP) (Photo by EVELYN HOCKSTEIN/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. officials denied that the Biden administration was lobbying against a censure motion or that there was daylight between them and their European counterparts, according to the WSJ. “We are increasing pressure on Iran through sanctions and international isolation,” a U.S. official told the WSJ, noting that the Biden administration is “tightly coordinated” with its European partners ahead of the IAEA board meeting in June. Another official said it is “totally false” that the Biden administration is attempting to avoid confrontation with Iran ahead of U.S. elections. Iran has enriched enough uranium and fissile material to create three nuclear weapons, according to the latest data from the IAEA, the United Nations’ (UN) organization with overseeing and policing Tehran’s nuclear activities. Iran regularly tries to ignore or circumvent IAEA oversight; IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi traveled to Tehran in early May to improve coordination with the Iranian regime to little avail, and European diplomats don’t expect a change in the status quo ahead of the June board meeting, according to the WSJ. Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Grossi speaks to the media at his return from his official visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran, on May 7, 2024, at the Vienna airport in Vienna, Austria. (Photo by Joe Klamar / AFP) (Photo by JOE KLAMAR/AFP via Getty Images) A key goal of the Biden administration was to get Iran back to a framework similar to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), more informally referred to as the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The nuclear deal was spearheaded by the Obama administration and eased up on international sanctions against Iran, in exchange for Tehran’s agreement to restrict its nuclear activities; the Trump administration pulled the U.S. out of the deal in 2018, citing its failure to properly contain Iran’s nuclear program while allowing to Islamic regime to economically thrive under sanctions relief. Iran has expanded its nuclear program since the U.S. pulled out of the deal. The Biden administration has thus far failed to get Iran back into a nuclear agreement, with talks falling apart completely in late 2022. The administration has since attempted to take a diplomatic approach in dealing with Iran in the hopes of containing its nuclear program; the administration fears that if a censure vote is passed at the IAEA in June, it could anger Tehran and cause the regime to become more obstinate at oversight attempts, especially because of regime volatility concerns after the recent death of Iranian President Ebrahim . Critics and lawmakers have the Biden administration’s “appeasement” approach toward Iran, which they claim has only emboldened the country against the rest of the West.

The eight-person team at the State Department in the USA is leading Washington's efforts to ease the economic blowback for countries targeted by China. It emerged in the scramble to help Lithuania during a spat with China over Taiwan two years ago.

A n eight-person team at the State Department is leading Washington's efforts to ease the economic blowback for countries targeted by China. (AP) Countries “knock on the door, they call,” Undersecretary of State Jose Fernandez told The Associated Press in a recent interview. “We run a consulting firm that does not have to advertise for clients, as they come,\" she said. Led by State Department senior adviser Melanie Hart, the group reviews vulnerabilities and develops responses for countries that are cut off or fear losing trade with global powerhouse China. Since the group's launch with Lithuania, more than a dozen countries have approached the Biden administration for assistance, Fernandez said.

The Chinese Embassy in Washington took issue with the notion that Beijing is using economic pressure on other countries, calling it “completely unfounded\". The US, it said, was the one bullying China economically by abusing export controls, treating Chinese companies unfairly and labelling Beijing as a perpetrator of economic coercion. Fernandez said that is a tactic China “is using over and over\". \"They believe that intimidation works. That’s why we got into the act. The time had come to stop this thing.\" he said. For example, when a Norwegian committee in 2010 awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to a Chinese dissident, Beijing stopped buying salmon from the Nordic country.

(AP) Two years later, China rejected banana imports from the Philippines over a territorial dispute in the South China Sea.

READ MORE: First shipment of wine leaves for China since tariffs lifted﻿ In late 2021 and early 2022, Lithuanian businesses saw their cargo shipments to and from China stranded, and they were warned by major European businesses that Lithuanian-made auto parts would be barred from products for the Chinese market. That came after Lithuania allowed Taiwan's de-facto embassy in Vilnius to bear the name Taiwan, instead of Taipei — Taiwan's capital city — as preferred by Beijing. South Australian winemakers are toasting new opportunities after China lifted its tariff on Australian wine. (9News) China considers the self-governed island to be part of Chinese territory and protested the use of Taiwan. Instead of caving in, the northern European country asked for help. The US and its allies stepped up. American diplomats sought new markets for Lithuanian goods. The Export-Import Bank in Washington provided Vilnius with $600 million in export credit, and the Pentagon signed a procurement agreement with the country. And “the firm” kept at it. The State Department works as the first line of response and can coordinate with other US agencies to reach “every tool that the US government has,” according to a department official who asked not to be named to discuss details of the team. While it takes years to reorient global supply chains to reduce reliance on countries such as China, the team tries to offer a quicker way to ease a crisis, the official said, comparing the team to ambulance services that “help you get past that scary emergency time\".

The assistance is confidential, the official said, declining to discuss the tools at the team’s disposal or name the countries that have sought help. Shay Wester, director of Asian economic affairs at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said it was “a significant and much-needed initiative\". “China’s growing use of economic coercion to pressure countries over political disputes is a significant challenge that requires a concerted response,” said Wester, who co-authored an April report on the issue. The responses from other countries show that demand is high for this kind of support, Wester said. This month, Lithuania hosted a conference on resisting economic pressure, and Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said the aim of that action \"is to crush the victims by forcing reversal and public renunciation of its policies\". Liu Pengyu, the Chinese Embassy spokesman, said the problem with Lithuania was “a political not an economic one\". \"They were caused by Lithuania’s acts in bad faith that hurt China’s interests, not China’s pressure on Lithuania,\" he said. Fernandez, who attended the conference, applauded Lithuania for standing up to China. “Lithuania gave us the opportunity to prove that there were alternatives to the coercion,” he said.",

        "content": "Ipswich Town’s Kieran McKenna remains the frontrunner to take the vacant Brighton job, talkSPORT understands. The Northern Irish manager has overseen back-to-back promotions with the Tractor Boys but could be set to leave this summer. McKenna has also been linked with former club Manchester United, with whom he was assistant to Jose Mourinho, and Chelsea . However, talkSPORT understands the 38-year-old is no longer a candidate to replace Mauricio Pochettino at the Blues. Ipswich are thought to be interested in Luton’s Rob Edwards as a potential replacement if McKenna does leave the club. Former Hull manager Liam Rosenior is also a contender after he was sacked by the Tigers despite finishing seventh in the Championship. Brighton are currently looking for their successor to Roberto De Zerbi after it was announced he will leave them this summer. The Italian replaced Graham Potter in September 2022 and was able to guide to the club to Europe for the first time ever last season. De Zerbi has been linked with the Chelsea job but talkSPORT understands they want to appoint Enzo Maresca from Leicester City. McKenna could therefore be set to take the Brighton hot seat ahead of next season, their eighth consecutive top-flight campaign. He guided Ipswich to second in the Championship, just a point behind title winners Leicester and six clear of the play-offs. Their remarkable achievement comes a year after promotion from League One and ends their 22-year Premier League absence. Ipswich will join Leicester and play-off final winners Southampton in the top-flight next season but McKenna may not be in charge. Brighton, who finished 11th, are confident of securing his services ahead of the summer.",

        "description": "NALSAR vice-chancellor professor Srikrishna Deva Rao said there was a need to change the decades-old laws in commensurate with the advancements in technology and new situations",
        "content": "The main objective of the recently amended three criminal laws, to be enforced from July 1, was to strengthen the overall administration of criminal justice system, said NALSAR vice-chancellor professor Srikrishna Deva Rao on Monday. He was speaking at a workshop for journalists convened by the Press Information Bureau of the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. “Though several changes were made to the Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code and the Indian Evidence Act, the approach was piece-meal,” Mr. Rao remarked. These three laws were amended and re-christened Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, Bharatiya Nagarika Suraksha Sanhita and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam respectively. Explaining the salient features of the amended laws, Mr. Rao said there was a need to change the decades-old laws in commensurate with the advancements in technology and new situations. Law makers wanted these laws to be victim-centric rather than punishment oriented though stringer punishments were introduced for some specific crimes. Crimes like mob lynching, which were hitherto not classified under any specific sections, were defined under new sections of the law, he said. Central Detective Training School Director and IPS officer N. Rajashekhara explained the major changes introduced in the three laws. The time limits for speedy trial and adjudication of criminal cases would ensure quicker justice for victims. In addition to defining organised crimes involving huge sums of money, organised crimes inflicting financial losses on a smaller scale like blocking tickets for shows, unauthorised betting or gambling were specifically defined under separate sections. Retired IPS officer and former IGP of Andhra Prdesh cadre E. Damoder described the amendments made to the criminal laws as a ‘sincere and small attempt’ by the government to throw away darkness in administration of criminal justice system in the country.

        "description": "The article explores the origins and impacts of magnetism on Earth, focusing on Frank Close's book 'CHARGE: Why Does Gravity Rule?' and his explanation of how magnetism became integral to the planet's history.",
        "content": "NEW DELHI: Magnetism, one of the most tangible fundamental forces, has been a part of Earth 's history since its formation. In his new book, \" CHARGE : Why Does Gravity Rule?\", theoretical physicist Frank Close explores the origins and impacts of this force, explaining how magnetism became an integral part of our planet. Five billion years ago, as the newborn Earth existed as a hot plasma with swirling electrical currents, these flows created magnetic fields. As the magma cooled and formed the Earth's solid outer crust, magnetism was locked into minerals containing iron, such as magnetite. Today, the Earth's liquid core still generates electric currents, which produce a magnetic field that extends into the atmosphere and beyond, although it remains invisible to our senses. As Frank Close describes, \"Magnetism is a manifestation of electricity, and vice versa. Electricity and magnetism were imprinted into our surroundings from the beginning.\" This ancient magnetism left a tangible imprint on the Earth's crust, where it continues to influence the planet far more powerfully than gravity in certain respects. Around four billion years ago, as the Earth's surface cooled, iron and other atomic elements accumulated in the strata. Iron, one of the most stable and abundant elements, became magnetic when influenced by the magnetic field. This property can be demonstrated using a bar magnet and iron filings, which align themselves to reveal the direction of the magnetic force. The Earth's magnetic field is analogous to a bar magnet, with north and south magnetic poles extending far into space. Historically, magnetic rocks, known as lodestone or magnetite, were discovered in various parts of the world, such as the Isle of Elba and Mount Ida in Asia Minor. These rocks retain their magnetic properties, revealing the ancient magnetic forces at work. There are legends about the discovery of magnetism, such as a shepherd named Magnes whose iron-nailed shoes were gripped by magnetite. While the exact origins are uncertain, the power of magnetism has likely been known for thousands of years, inspired by natural magnetization of iron in rocks and further revealed through activities like smelting. By the sixteenth century, travelers documented significant examples of magnetic rocks from regions like East India and the Chinese coast. The understanding of magnetism evolved through various cultures and languages, becoming an essential part of scientific knowledge. Frank Close's exploration in \"CHARGE: Why Does Gravity Rule?\" highlights how magnetism, though often overshadowed by gravity, plays a crucial role in the Earth's structure and history. The force of magnetism, imprinted in our planet billions of years ago, continues to be a powerful and fascinating aspect of Earth's geophysical dynamics.",

        "content": "Zverev holds his serve and Nadal will now serve to stay in the set. Think most people were predicting Zverev to put the great man away in straight sets and if this does get to 1-1, with the vibe Nadal is generating on court, well I’d say all bets are off..... Nadal serving. 15-30. Zverev with a wonderful hit on the run, surely thinks he has passed his man but Nadal produces a lovely pick up low shot to win the point. Gossamer touch at the net now from Rafa, his short game has been flawless today, winning nine points out of nine at the net. At 40-30, Zverev has the court and point at his command but flaps the ball into the net. That is the hold Zverev needed. Commanding, energy surpressing. Rafa is starting to happen, he’s trying things that are working, the crowd are cheering his every move. Battle now for AZ is not so much the technical but the emotional side of the contest. Nadal holds. Zverev needs a few steely serves, quieten the energy. Hint of a sniff of a chance as Zverev serves at 30-30. RN takes the initiative, he knows that he has to swing for the fences here, Zverev on the back foot and he makes an error into the net. 30-40. Nadal gets the serve back and it creeps in.... Zverev unsettled, loses his timing, a poor shot, and Nadal wins the point with a drop shot! Nadal with a break of serve! That’s what I was saying about Rafa getting into Zverev’s head. The huge celebration after saving break points brought the crowd to life. And then the Zverev forehand - always his shakier side - began to show a few cracks, leading to Nadal’s first break of serve. Fans having a ball now. Although I should say they have been pretty sporting. Big applause for a Zverev forehand winner in the last game. I’ve been at Djokovic-Federer matches in New York where Djokovic hits a winner and there’s tumbleweed Nadal serve under real pressure here but he just about holds on. Crowd roaring him on now as he produces an ace at 30-40. Gets out of jail. A brace of aces in this Zverev hold. Some sporting royalty spotted in the crowd. Not just Manchester City’s Rodri but two of the favourites for this title: Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz. They clearly think it might be Nadal’s French Open finale, even if he isn’t sure. Nadal with a determined hold in the second game, however. His cause helped by Zverev bungling a regulation overhead shot. Excellent point from Nadal at 40-0! Dogged defence into insisting ground strokes, then he picks a drop shot early, gets there, and puts it away for a winner. Fist pump and a roar! Zverev will be looking to go up a gear here and break the back of the match early in the second set. A dominant service hold sends him onwards. In his pre-tournament press conference, Nadal said “If, in the bottom of my heart, I don’t have any hope to have success here and to create a beautiful thing this year, I will not be here in front of you guys.” I’m not sure this match has been “beautiful” thus far but it’s warmed up into a decent spectacle. And, crucially, not one that embarrasses Nadal (although he has just walked off court for an early bathroom break). Certainly better than his most recent outing in Rome, a 6-1, 6-3 humbling at the hands of Hubert Hurkacz. The critical stat so far is surely Zverev’s 78 per cent first serves in. It’s deuce. Reaching for a crosscourt, Nadal finds the net. It’s set point to the German. RN takes charge of the rally with hard, flat, aggressive groundstrokes and forces an error. A second deuce. But eventually Zverev wins the game and Zverev wins the first set. Zverev wins first set 6-3, breaking Nadal in the first game and the ninth game of the opener. Nadal only got 58% of his first serves in. Another hold from Zverev takes him to within a game of the first set. Nadal holds. He looks like he is enjoying himself. He’s moving Zverev around the court a bit more and he’s getting into it. No doubt as to where the crowd’s affections lie, and correctly so: Nadal, a legend, a gent. Zverev, well the less said the better. Zverev’s turn to hold his serve to love. Here’s more from Briggsy: “Zverev really settling to his work now, and hitting at an average of 83mph off both wings. Nadal way behind on 72 for his forehand and 74 for his backhand. That’s a little misleading in a way, because his forehand has a spin-laden heaviness to it which makes the ball harder to deal with, even if it’s not as quick through the air. But still a decisive difference.” After a nervy three, three-and-a-half games, some signs that the players are settling in. Quite the occasion this. Up in the press box, there was an unseemly scramble for seats. Nadal, hearteningly, holds his serve to love. It’s raining in Paris by the way, although obviously we are under the roof on this court. Zverev holds his serve. Vital hold for Nadal, who is on the board. And perhaps encouraged by the fact that Zverev has made a couple of backhand errors in this game. Bit of a delay because a couple of punters in the posh seats are moving around and causing distraction. That’s age for ya. Little drop shot from Zverev, not perfect and it sits up a bit. In his prime, Rafa would have hared over there, slid, and hit a winner. But today, he just gives it up when six or eight yards away, knowing that it would be a waste of energy. Nadal wins the first two points of that game. When he can stand and deliver he still looks mighty but the court coverage is going to be the issue. If Sascha can play the man not the legend here, he should win with plenty in hand. Nadal is up against is straight away. Zverev aggressive, direct, moving the Spanish veteran around and he’s been very dominant there. Before you know it, it’s 0-40 and, not that the great man needed telling, but he knows he’s in a huge fight. Zverev takes the first of the three break points at his disposal. shirt with white shorts, his opponent in a shirt with a yellow front and white back. It’s Nadal to serve first. A few boos ring out among the cheers as Alexander Zverev enters the stadium. The closed roof clearly favours Zverev, both because Nadal is the world’s best windy-weather player (his heavy spin cuts through the breeze) and because Zverev has arguably the best serve in the game right now, which will only be enhanced by the lack of any wind to disrupt his ball-toss. He is landing a mind-boggling 74 per cent of his first serves this season, and unless Nadal gets in his head, I’d expect that figure to climb above 80 today. To a rapturous reception, as you might imagine, and this could be a fantastic occasion. By the way, it’s Alan Tyers here to talk you through the action. Hello and welcome to coverage from the French Open in what could be Rafael Nadal’s final match at Roland Garros. The 14-time champion begins his campaign against Alexander Zverev, which is the standout match in the first round. “It’s not ideal the first match, because I feel competitive to have this match later in the tournament, but it’s how it is,” Nadal said. “I need to be ready since the beginning. Let’s see.” The meeting will bring back contrasting memories for both players of the last time they met, in a French Open semi-final in 2022, when Nadal went on to win yet another title in Paris, the last of his 22 Grand Slam victories. Zverev was forced to retire from that match with an ankle injury. He underwent surgery and ended up missing the rest of the season with another injury, but he returned last year to reach his third consecutive French Open semi-final. With some of the other top players such as Novak Djokovic, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, struggling with injuries of late, this could be Zverev’s chance to finally win a Grand Slam. The German might not have wanted to meet Nadal so early in the tournament but he was happy to have the chance to take him on again. “I really wanted to play him here. I did not want to play him in the first round. I wanted to play him in the semi-finals, finals, a later stage of the tournament,” Zverev said. “But at the end of the day, he’s not seeded, it is how it is, and I think we’re both prepared for a tough battle.” Any plans to pay tribute to Nadal if he loses have been scuppered because he has said this might not necessarily be his final appearance at the tournament. “As you can imagine, we had something planned for him. But ... because he doesn’t know if it’s going to be his last Roland Garros or not, he wants to leave the door open maybe to come back next year as a player. So we are not going to push him, obviously, to do anything,” Mauresmo said. “It’s his decision when he wants to have a proper ceremony, a proper goodbye, a proper farewell. So we’re not going to do it this year. That’s his wish,” she continued. “And even though we were ready to push the button if something happens, we obviously are going to respect what he wants and make sure we are ready whenever he feels he wants to do it. Later this year; next year; anytime he wants.”",

        "content": "The US Dollar (USD) trades a little softer against most major peers on Monday as there is not much to report for the Greenback, with US markets closed for the Memorial Day holidays. However, on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, a change in stance on the (ECB) is starting to form. There is a very quiet economic data calendar on Monday. Most of this week will be rather quiet, with only some soft data and US (Fed) speeches ahead towards Thursday. Then, the second estimate for the Q1 US (GDP) on Thursday and April’s US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) numbers on Friday could hit markets and leave more clues on the disinflationary pathway in the US and what the Fed might do next. (DXY) faces a bit of a horror story on the technical front after its weekly close on Friday. First of all, on the weekly chart, the DXY closed below the 100-week Simple Moving Average (SMA), which is a severe bearish signal and could point to a further downturn. A similar picture is seen on the daily chart, where the DXY was unable to stay afloat above the 55-day SMA at 104.86 and gave up its gains for the week above 105.00. On the upside, the DXY index needs to reclaim those levels it lost last week: the 55-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 104.86 and the 105.00 big round level. Further up, the following levels to consider are 105.12 and 105.52. On the downside, the 200-day SMA at 104.40 and the 100-day SMA around 104.30 are the last line of defence. Once that level snaps, an air pocket is placed between 104.30 and 103.00. Should the US Dollar decline persist, the low of March at 102.35 and the low from December at 100.62 are levels to consider. ECB FAQs The European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy for the region. The ECB primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means keeping inflation at around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is by raising or lowering interest rates. Relatively high interest rates will usually result in a stronger Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde. In extreme situations, the European Central Bank can enact a policy tool called Quantitative Easing. QE is the process by which the ECB prints Euros and uses them to buy assets – usually government or corporate bonds – from banks and other financial institutions. QE usually results in a weaker Euro. QE is a last resort when simply lowering interest rates is unlikely to achieve the objective of price stability. The ECB used it during the Great Financial Crisis in 2009-11, in 2015 when inflation remained stubbornly low, as well as during the covid pandemic. Quantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse of QE. It is undertaken after QE when an economic recovery is underway and inflation starts rising. Whilst in QE the European Central Bank (ECB) purchases government and corporate bonds from financial institutions to provide them with liquidity, in QT the ECB stops buying more bonds, and stops reinvesting the principal maturing on the bonds it already holds. It is usually positive (or bullish) for the Euro.",

        "content": "Indian police said Monday they had arrested a doctor and the owner of an unlicensed hospital where six newborn babies died in a fire in a crowded ward without fire exits. The blaze broke out at the New Born Baby Care hospital in New Delhi’s Vivek Vihar area late Saturday evening. In the crucial first minutes, it was bystanders who spotted the fire and braved the blaze to rescue the newborns inside. “We didn’t even name her... I never even held her in my arms,” Anjar Khan, whose 11-day-old daughter died in the blaze, was quoted as saying by the Hindustan Times. Vinod Sharma, who lost his day-old baby boy, blamed the hospital authorities for the tragedy. “He had a problem with breathing. The doctor had said that he will be fine in a few days,” Sharma was quoted as saying by the Indian Express newspaper. “We didn’t know that the hospital would kill him.” – Five babies rescued alive – Fires are common in India due to poor building practices, overcrowding, and a lack of adherence to safety regulations. The narrow two-storey hospital building was squeezed between a row of homes, without space on either side, making it hard for fire engines to reach. “We were trying to control the fire, but there was no way to enter the building and rescue the 12 babies who were trapped,” local fire officer Atul Garg told reporters. Senior police officer Surendra Chaudhary told AFP that the hospital did “not have a fire exit system”. Its licence had expired in March and the owner had crammed into the ward more than twice the number of beds it previously had permission for. “The hospital had permission for up to five beds but they had installed more than 10 beds,” he said. “In view of all this, we have made the arrests.” Five babies pulled out from the fire are still recovering in another hospital. – ‘Highly flammable’ – The blaze in the hospital on Saturday broke out just hours after a separate fire at an amusement park in India’s western state of Gujarat. The toll from that fire rose to 28 on Monday, police said. The blaze — which ripped through a centre with a bowling alley and other games crowded with youngsters — was triggered by welding work on the ground floor, chief fire officer Ilesh Kher told reporters. “The CCTV footage clearly shows that a spark from the welding work fell on a stack of corrugated cardboard sheets below, causing the fire,” Kher said. “This spread very fast as the material was highly flammable.” The corpses were so badly burned they have not been identified so far. Police have charged seven people with culpable homicide in connection to that fire. The two fires came as northern India was gripped by intense heat, with temperatures in Delhi hitting 46.8 degrees Celsius (116.2 degrees Fahrenheit) on Saturday, according to the India Meteorological Department.

The incident occurred in Ranchi city of India on Monday after a group of people got into a verbal spat with the DJ and bar staff, an Indian media outlet reported. According to details, a group of five men got into an argument with the bar staff over playing music. While the issue was resolved after others intervened and the group left, the suspects later returned after the bar was closed and shot dead the DJ, identified as Sandeep. The viral video of the shooting caught by CCTV camera showed a man brandishing a rifle before pointing it at Sandeep and firing at point-blank range. Viewer Discretion Advised Following the shooting, the staff at the bar informed the police, however, the suspects fled the scene before they could be arrested.

Meanwhile, police said that the suspected shooter was identified as Abhishek Singh while his vehicle was also recovered from the scene. Later, police filed a case over the shooting and were investigating the staff at the bar while CCTV footage from the bar was also obtained to apprehend the suspects. Last year, a radio anchor was shot dead while broadcasting a live stream in the Philippines.

        "content": "ISLAMABAD: The federal and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governments have agreed to jointly work to overcome power losses and recover areas, with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi asserting ‘major breakthrough’ in meeting with KP Chief Minister (CM) Ali Amin Gandapur, ARY News reported on Monday. The development was announced during a press conference following meeting between Ali Amin Gandapur and Mohsin Naqvi. Federal Minister for Energy Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari and the federal interior secretary also attended the meeting. The KP government and the Centre had been at odds over multiple issues, including the loadshedding in the province with CM Gandapur even threatening to take control of the Peshawar Electric Supply Company (Pesco). Moreover, the KP chief minister was also demanding to clear its dues to the province owed to the province by the federal government. Addressing a joint press conference, KP CM Gandapur assured that his government will play its role in unison with the Centre to reduce electricity losses. “A drive with the cooperation of the public representatives and the community members will be launched to create awareness in this regard,” he added. The Chief Minister said it was also agreed to provide immediate relief to the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa till the strategy to overcome losses starts yielding dividends. He said the provincial government will also go for solarisation in different parts of the province so that “electricity losses can be controlled”. “We have conceived a strategy to make Khyber Pakhtunkhwa a load-shedding-free province”, Gandapur said, thanking the federal government for its support and cooperation. In response to a question about the meeting, the Chief Minister said, “We have given each other some targets, and we have made some commitments to each other. We will work together to provide relief to the people of the province.” The Chief Minister added that the outcomes of the meeting would soon come to light, and that the aim of the government is to provide relief to the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Leghari said the plan would be finalized by tomorrow, adding the model which was devised for KP would also be replicated in the other provinces. He said line losses and power theft issues in the country would be addressed jointly. Lauding the Interior Minister for playing a key role in this regard, he said the federal and provincial departments would jointly work to sort out issues pertaining to load-shedding, power theft and recovery. The power load-shedding could be over-powered through elimination of power pilferage, he said. The minister said PTI, PML-N and allied parties jointly took a step to revive the country’s economy. Praising the CM KP, he said that today all political parties have recognised the Pakistan’s agenda. Under the plan, parliamentarians and general public would be involved to create awareness among the masses about elimination of power theft and payment of outstanding dues. ‘Major breakthrough’ Talking to journalists, Mohsin Naqvi said that the meeting concluded with a “major breakthrough”, without specifying details. However, he said, the meeting was held in a pleasant atmosphere, with matters related to public relief came under discussion. “The government and the Ministry of Energy have been engaged in positive talks over the past few days”, he said. Read More: CM Gandapur meets Mohsin Naqvi to discuss KP situation Naqvi stated that the discussions between the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and the Ministry of Energy have been productive, and both parties share the common goal of providing relief to the public. He emphasised that the government is committed to minimising the sufferings of the people and providing them with relief. He also acknowledged that the federal government also has a responsibility to address the issues in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, particularly the law and order situation.",

        "content": "Powerful storms have killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central US / (min cost $ 0 ) or signup to continue reading The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas. On Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City. Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference Sunday. The dead included two children, ages two and five. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff. Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity. The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county's emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. Three people have died in Kentucky. Gov. Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early Monday in a post on social media platform X, citing \"multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes.\" The small community of Charleston took a direct hit from the storm Sunday night, where several homes were destroyed and utilities were knocked out. \"It's a big mess,\" said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs. \"Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever - no water, no power.\" Charleston is an unincorporated community two miles north of Dawson Spring, which was devastated by a tornado in late 2021. Beshear's father, former two-term Gov. Steve Beshear, grew up in Dawson Springs. In Texas, about 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, Abbott said, sitting in front of a ravaged truck stop near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest hit, with winds reaching an estimated 217 kph, officials said. \"The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,\" said Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts of severe weather, including storms that killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. Abbot signed an amended severe weather disaster declaration on Sunday to include Denton, Montague, Cooke and Collin on a list of counties already under a disaster declaration sparked by storms and flooding in late April. Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot. \"A firefighter came to check on us and he said, 'You're very lucky,'\" Parra said. \"The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.\" Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas. The destruction continued a grim month of deadly severe weather in the nation's midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Meteorologists and authorities issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region late Saturday and into Sunday. \"If you are in the path of this storm take cover now!\" the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma, posted on X. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months.

The opposition Democratic Party (DP), the oldest political party, has for years not escaped the internal political bickering epidemic that has infected nearly all other parties in the country. The latest is the resignation of Anthony Waddimba,hitherto serving as the personal Assistant(PA) to the DP President General Norbert Mao who is also the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs under the ruling NRM government of President Yoweri Museveni. Anthony Waddimba in his unusually very long letter-turned dossier listed a number of unpleasant issues that the DP honcho has left “undone and done what he ought not to have done”, which he says has reduced the egumire party to a laughing stock. We at Watchdog Uganda are happy to share verbatim contents of the Anthony Waddimba dossier, which has left Ugandans tongue wagging. Read on:",

        "description": "The ambitious plan aims to transform how the city utilises drone technology to enhance public services",
        "content": "Dublin City Council has launched its first ever inaugural Drone and Urban Air Mobility Strategy. The plan aims to revolutionise the city's use of drone technology to augment public services whilst also exploring future capabilities. Drones have increasingly been used in a number of city services, enhancing efficiency, diminishing costs and simplifying processes. Within Council operations, drones are employed across various sectors including mapping, inspective precarious buildings or used during emergency response. They have also proved practical in accessing difficult-to-reach areas for environmental monitoring and surveys, thus optimising management and overview of urban locations. Read more: Local elections 2024 list of candidates for Dublin City Council areas Read more: Model who flashed Dublin Portal says people who were mad 'probably never get laid’ Assistant Chief Executive and Chair of the Drones High Level Steering Group Eileen Quinlivan said: \"This strategy marks a significant milestone for Dublin City Council . By embracing drone technology, we are not only enhancing our service delivery but also paving the way for a smarter, more sustainable city. \"Drones will revolutionise how we approach various tasks, from emergency response and infrastructure inspections to environmental monitoring and urban planning. The benefits for our staff and citizens are immense, and we are committed to ensuring that Dublin remains at the forefront of this urban innovation.\" The local authority is setting up a dedicated Drone Unit to centralise drone operations and support internal departments in adopting the technology. The unit will build on existing capabilities and resources, maximising efficiencies across the council. It will also play a role in supporting innovation in the drone industry by helping develop new services that benefit citizens and communities as the commercial sector grows. Jim Gavin, Chief Operations Officer at the Irish Aviation Authority, said: \"The Irish Aviation Authority is very supportive of public sector bodies developing drone strategies. We are delighted to support this initiative by Dublin City Council to develop their drone strategy where they will drive innovation and development in the drone sector. \"By harnessing the potential of drones, Dublin City Council is taking proactive steps to enhance public safety, improve efficiency, and foster economic growth. We believe that this initiative will pave the way for advancements in urban air mobility, benefiting both the public and the broader aviation industry.\" Dublin City Council's Smart City programme has been at the forefront of developing the Drone and Urban Air Mobility Strategy, aiming to future-proof the application of new and emerging technologies. The initiative is set to bolster Dublin's economy by creating a dynamic drone technology ecosystem that could attract fresh businesses and establish Dublin as a frontrunner in this cutting-edge industry. Julie Garland, the Founder and CEO of Avtrain, who lent her expertise to the development of the Strategy, highlighted the game-changing impact of drones: \"Drones are revolutionising how we think about urban mobility and public service delivery. \"Dublin's strategy is a step towards a future where drone technology can improve our daily lives, enhance safety, and contribute to a more sustainable environment. By integrating drones into various city services, cities can streamline operations, reduce response times in emergencies, and provide more efficient monitoring of infrastructure and environmental conditions.\" For all the latest news from Dublin and surrounding areas visit our homepage .

        "content": "Rock duo The Black Keys, known for hits including “Lonely Boy” and “Gold on the Ceiling,” recently canceled a 31-stop North American leg of an international tour without giving a reason — but the band is assuring fans its members, Patrick Carney and Dan Auerbach, are “alive and well.” The tour, called the “International Players Tour,” originally kicked off in Oklahoma on Sept. 17, and had dates through the fall in Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Denver, Nashville, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Portland, the San Francisco bay area, Seattle, New York and Boston — among other places. The band was set to play the TD Garden in Boston on Friday, Nov 1. All of those dates are listed as canceled on Ticketmaster, and the band has not given a reason why. The band tweeted to X, formerly known as Twitter, a promotional image for the tour with a “Please Stand By” label on top of it, along with the message: “The band wants to assure everyone that Dan & Patrick are alive and well.” The tweet thread goes on to say that the band “decided to make some changes to the North American leg of the International Players tour” after playing in Europe. “That will enable us to offer a similar exciting, intimate experience for both fans and the band, and will be announcing a revised set of dates shortly,” the tweet thread continues, stating that those who bought tickets would be fully refunded and would get the first opportunity to buy tickets when new plans are announced. The Black Keys had released its new album, “Ohio Players,” in early April, including single “ On The Game .” The two musicians have known each other since the age of 8 or 9 growing up in Akron, Ohio, according to Vulture . They later moved to Nashville, and found major success with albums including “Brothers” and “El Camino,” the latter of which includes some of their most recognizable songs, like “ Lonely Boy .” Only one tour date still exists on the band’s website — a performance on July 6 at the NASCAR Chicago Street Race in Chicago.

        "content": "A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial led by a collaboration between Duke-NUS Medical School, National Heart Center Singapore (NHCS) and Klinikum Nürnberg, Germany, has revealed surprising new insights into how SGLT2 inhibitor drugs, originally developed for diabetes, benefit patients with heart failure. Contrary to common assumptions, these drugs may improve cardiac outcomes and heart health without acting as diuretics. Heart failure is a condition where the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's demands, often leading to fluid build-up in tissues and congestion of the blood circulation. This congestion strains the heart and causes symptoms like breathlessness and swelling. Reducing congestion is key to managing heart failure , as it reduces the workload of the heart and thereby eases pumping. SGLT2 inhibitor drugs are the new blockbuster treatment for chronic heart failure because they very quickly stabilize heart function and reduce hospitalizations and patient deaths. The drugs release more glucose into the urine , and thereby have the potential to pull more fluid from the body into the urine, alleviating the congestion experienced by patients with heart disease. Given this diuretic potential, leaflets accompanying the drugs list dehydration as a common side effect of their use. However, results from this clinical trial, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology , cast doubt on the presumed diuretic action of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure. First author Dr. Adriana Marton, visiting senior research fellow with the Cardiovascular & Metabolic Disorders Program at Duke-NUS, who kicked-off this pilot study in Singapore, said, \"Many experts who relied on the idea that SGLT2 inhibitors act as diuretic drugs raised their eyebrows when we first reported our data, showing that the body instead activates a very elegant defense mechanism that almost entirely abolishes the potential diuretic effects of these drugs.\" Conducted together with NHCS in Singapore, the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, the gold standard of clinical trials, examined the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in patients with chronic heart failure. As expected, the drug sharply increased urine glucose excretion. This increased concentration of glucose in urine creates an osmotic imbalance that should cause more water to be pulled into the urine and therefore increase urine volume. But that's not what happened. Instead, the body responded by releasing more vasopressin, a brain hormone that instructs the kidneys to conserve water. This minimized any rise in urine volume and even after 24 hours, patients' urine volume remained stable despite persistent glucose excretion from dapagliflozin. These results, which are the first to be published from this international collaborative project, contradict the prevailing theory that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce congestion through diuresis or increased urine production. Senior author Associate Professor Jens Titze from the Cardiovascular & Metabolic Disorders Program at Duke-NUS, explained that the brain quickly compensates for potential dehydration caused by these drugs, suggesting that their benefit to patients with heart failure might be through mechanisms other than reducing fluid overload. \"It seems that the brain's internal hydration meter very quickly detects reduced hydration levels, and then forces the kidneys to further concentrate the urine to prevent body water loss. This suggests that we need to rethink our assumptions of how SGLT2 inhibitors benefit patients with heart failure, since decongestion by increased urine production doesn't seem to be the answer,\" said Titze. Associate Professor David Sim, head and senior consultant from the Department of Cardiology at NHCS and a senior co-author of the study, said, \"As a cardiologist caring for many patients with heart failure, I am excited by the fresh perspective this study brings and the wider benefits these drugs may confer. \"We need robust research like this to stimulate new thinking on how to optimally treat heart failure—and ideally to prevent the disease even before it occurs. Our ultimate goal is to translate these insights into better outcomes for our patients, and to support Singaporeans in living long and healthy lives without heart disease .\" While these drugs clearly benefit patients with heart failure or chronic kidney disease, the mechanisms responsible for these beneficial effects are still unclear. One theory is that the process of energy and water conservation induced by these drugs induces metabolic changes in the body that improve organ function. \"We think that the initial glucose and water loss caused by the SGLT2 inhibitors triggers some ancient and highly conserved evolutionary body survival signals that flip metabolic switches to improve heart and kidney function,\" said Titze. \"Imagine walking in the desert on limited food and water. Your body would adapt by slowing non-essential processes to conserve resources, and invest energy only in the processes you really need. We hypothesize that SGLT2 inhibitors trigger similar survival pathways that re-program cell metabolism.\" In parallel to the clinical trial in Singapore, the team's collaborators in Germany have developed methods that are now available to detect activation of these ancient metabolic pathways in patients' urine. The team will use these to uncover the actual mechanisms behind these drugs' organ-protective benefits and investigate how these changes may improve the healthspan not just of patients with heart failure but also with kidney disease, diabetes or living with other aging-related ailments. \"We are very excited because we finally have treatment options that will improve the outcomes for these chronically ill patients, but there clearly is much more to learn about how these drugs protect the kidneys and the heart, and improve longevity, \" explained Dr. Marton. Martin is also a consultant nephrologist and clinical investigator at Klinikum Nürnberg and its medical university, Paracelsus Medizinische Privatuniversität (PMU), where she is currently conducting a follow-up clinical trial in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Lamberth recently granted a delay in Purdy's trial along with two co-defendants. Former President Donald Trump has been subjected to limited gag orders in a variety of criminal and civil cases, from Justice Juan Merchan in the hush money trial to Judge Tanya Chutkan in special counsel Jack Smith's election interference case and Justice Arthur Engoron in New York Attorney General Letitia James' civil fraud lawsuit. However, there is no formal gag order in Smith's Mar-a-Lago documents case, which has been delayed indefinitely by Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee. Smith last week requested from Cannon a partial gag order in that case, inspiring an angry rant from Trump on his Truth Social platform. In his Friday request , Smith told Cannon that a limited gag order is needed in order to discourage Trump from making statements \"that pose a significant, imminent, and foreseeable danger to law enforcement agents.\" READ MORE: What to watch for in Trump trial's closing arguments Smith's motion argues, \"The Government's request is necessary because of several intentionally false and inflammatory statements recently made by Trump that distort the circumstances under which the Federal Bureau of Investigation planned and executed the search warrant at Mar-a-Lago. Those statements create a grossly misleading impression about the intentions and conduct of federal law enforcement agents — falsely suggesting that they were complicit in a plot to assassinate him — and expose those agents, some of whom will be witnesses at trial, to the risk of threats, violence, and harassment.\" Attorney George Conway, a Never Trump conservative who is fundraising for President Joe Biden's reelection campaign, applauded Smith's gag order request during a CNN appearance — while Trump railed against the special counsel on Truth Social. Trump posted , \"I guess they're hoping they can silence me from telling the TRUTH like the Corrupt and Highly Conflicted Judge in New York City has done. Gag Orders have a very strong tendency to BACKFIRE, and if anybody should be GAGGED, it should be Deranged Jack, who was recently caught doing very bad things.\" It remains to be seen what Cannon will decide in response to Smith's request.

Trump has, for his part, consistently sought to make political hay out of the four different indictments he faces in four different jurisdictions.

The Daily Beast reported concerns that the former president’s aligning himself with North Carolina’s far-right candidate for governor, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson , is damaging his chances of taking the state. “He’s an opposition researcher’s dream,” Democratic strategist Morgan Jackson told the Beast. “Mark Robinson is the most extreme candidate for public office, period, in North Carolina, much less the race for governor.” He added, “If you're a CEO and you're thinking of moving your business to North Carolina, and Mark Robinson is the governor, I think your employees are going to tell you they want to go somewhere else.\" Among the extremist opinions Robinson has voiced are denial of the Holocaust and a desire to roll back feminism. “I absolutely want to go back to the America where women couldn’t vote, ” he said in 2020. But a Trump strategist told the Beast, “DJT likes him a lot.\" \"Clearly, it's not great,\" he added. ALSO READ: Inside Donald Trump’s billion-dollar Big Oil heist North Carolina-based GOP strategist Paul Shumaker said Robinson's campaign could have a \"reverse coattails\" effect on Trump — meaning Republicans who vote against Robinson might also vote against Trump rather than split their tickets. \"The Biden campaign will attempt to tie the two together,” Shumaker said. “Trump will distance himself and withdraw his endorsement if Robinson becomes too much of a liability. [I] can't underscore Ds' turnout problems enough.\" CONTINUE READING Show less Former President Donald Trump told a roomful of donors that he has plans to expel student demonstrators from the United States, insiders at the meeting told the Washington Post . Talking to a roomful of wealthy supporters — that he joked contained “98 percent of my Jewish friends” — he promised to deport anybody taking part in what he called a “radical revolution.” The promise would be a fundamental disregard for the right to freedom of speech. “One thing I do is, any student that protests, I throw them out of the country,” he told the group at the meeting on May 14, according to the Post. “You know, there are a lot of foreign students. As soon as they hear that, they’re going to behave,” He also praised the NYPD’s crackdown on Columbia University protesters , and urged police forces elsewhere to take similar action. “Well, if you get me elected, and you should really be doing this, if you get me reelected, we’re going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years,” he said, according to the Post’s insiders. “The private New York meeting offers new insight into his current thinking, ” the Post reported.

        "content": "Mount Baker Wild Theatre (MBWT) captivated audiences with a unique rendition of its latest production, Legally Blonde: The Musical, at Key City Theatre this past week. “Legally Blonde is a feel-good musical based on Heather Hach’s book with music and lyrics by Laurence O’Keefe and Nell Benjamin,” according to the MBWT program. The two-hour show made possible through Musical Theatre International (MTI), demonstrated the sophistication and talent of the cast and crew under Emily McCue’s direction. McCue and her team, including Musical Director Justin Swanson, captured the spirit of the 2001 movie starring Reese Witherspoon. The stellar cast carried the production, reaching a level of professionalism far beyond their high school years. Hailey Conroy plays Elle Woods, Legally Blonde’s heroine and aspiring Harvard law student following a breakup with her long-time boyfriend Warner Huntington III, played by Finn McBurney. Conroy carries the production with the help of a phenomenal supporting cast, including Edison Wilmot as Professor Callahan, Joelle Carlisle as Paulette Buonofonte and Hudson Gross as Emmett Forest. True to the original, Woods wins a seat at Harvard Law School and transforms from a lovestruck schoolgirl to a serious and competent law student, eventually graduating at the top of her once skeptical class. Through a myriad of scenes, choreography, sets, costumes, sound and lighting design, MBWT pulled off its latest production with aplomb while proving that a zebra can change its stripes. “Despite many doubts, Elle’s journey at law school defies all expectations while staying true to herself,” said the MBWT.",

        "content": "(Reuters): Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI has raised $6 billion in a Series B funding round, which is seen as the acceleration of the company’s efforts to push forward in the heating AI race and to challenge market rivals such as OpenAI. The Series B funding round of $6 billion came less than a year after the company’s debut in July 2023 and was backed by investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, among others, xAI said in a blog post on Sunday. The money will be used to bring xAI’s first products to market, build advanced infrastructure and accelerate research and development of future technologies, xAI said. The xAI startup released the Grok chatbot, which was trained to be integrated into the X platform, which Musk also owns. In a blog post on Sunday, the company touted the advancements of the xAI, citing the recent announcements of the improved Grok-1.5 model with long context capability and Grok-1.5V with image understanding. “There will be more to announce in the coming weeks,” Musk said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, in response to the funding announcement. “Pre-money valuation was $18B,” he noted. The AI race has been heating up, with several investors signing big checks for startups looking to compete with market leaders like OpenAI. Tech giant Microsoft has invested about $13 billion in OpenAI, while e-commerce giant Amazon backed Anthropic with $4 billion in funding. Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015 but left in 2018, later saying he was uncomfortable with the profit-driven direction the company was taking under the leadership of CEO Sam Altman.",

        "content": "Social welfare recipients have been warned to take note of a change to this week’s payment due to the upcoming June Bank Holiday. Monday June 3 is a public holiday and therefore all banks and Post Offices will be closed from Sunday until Tuesday. All welfare or pension payments due to be paid into a bank account or at a post office on Monday June 3 will instead be paid at the earlier date of Friday May 31. READ MORE : Many Irish workers missing out on €345 payment they can claim on top of their wages If you normally get paid by cheque and that is due on Monday June 3, it will be posted out a day earlier than usual so you may get it on Friday. Those receiving the child benefit payment, which is due on Tuesday June 4, should not be affected although recipients may be paid early as has been reported in the past by recipients, so parents may see their €140 monthly payment landing on Friday or Saturday. A spokesperson for the Department of Social Protection said: \"Monday 3 June is a Bank Holiday and as a result, any social welfare payments due to be in your account on Monday 3 June will now be paid on Friday 31 May instead. Payments will be paid as normal on Tuesday 4 June. \"All Intreo Centres and Branch Offices will be closed on Bank Holiday Monday 3 June. Intreo Centres and Branch Offices will reopen on Tuesday 4 June.\" Meanwhile, most employees are given paid leave on Monday, so if you qualify for the public holiday benefit, you are entitled to one of the following: If you’re a part-time employee, you are entitled to a day's pay for the public holiday if you meet both these conditions: According to Citizens Information: \"You can ask your employer at least 21 days before a public holiday, which of the alternatives will apply to you. \"If your employer does not respond at least 14 days before the public holiday, you are entitled to take the actual public holiday as a paid day off.\" Sign up for our daily newsletter to get the latest news direct to your inbox Join the Irish Mirror’s breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

        "content": "A viral post has reminded fans of a trailblazing Black trans character that serves as a timely reminder that trans representation in video games was once uncontroversial. A post on on Sunday (26 May) responded to a clip from the 2016 open-world hacking video game, commenting that it was “wild” and, in many ways, ahead of its time. “They had a Black trans woman as the protagonist’s mentor figure and nobody gave a s**t,” the post, which has been viewed more than one million times, and has 22,000 likes, read. The user appears to be referring to San Francisco city councillor Miranda Comay, who mentors protagonist Marcus Holloway throughout the game. A long-time friend of his family, Miranda is introduced after Marcus asks for information about the mysterious pseudo-religious cult New Dawn. Miranda reveals that she has a long and bitter history with the cult, but that she isn’t too fond of Marcus’ hacking collective, DedSec, either. Prior to her becoming a councilwoman, New Dawn harassed her and leaked information about her “surgeries,” seemingly alluding to gender-affirming procedures. While she admits that the ordeal was embarrassing, she has “nothing to hide”. Fans responding to the post expressed surprise that not only did a game from 2016 feature a Black trans character, but that she is incredibly fleshed out and not simply the butt of a joke. “I think the game came out before all the s**t happened so no one cared because it wasn’t a culture war issue yet,” one user suggested, referring to the controversy of more than 10 years ago. “ is more of a cult hit,” another explained. “[ burned people due to the overhype, and the initial PC launch was rough. Those who did eventually stick with it loved the game but it wasn’t really that popular.” Others joked that, given the game is set in San Francisco, the appearance of queer characters isn’t exactly a shock.",

To receive items such as dal, rice, and sugar from fair price shops, a family member must register their fingerprint on the biometric device integrated with the point-of-sale machine. But allegations were raised by the public that many a times the biometric device did not work properly, and they were unable to receive the things. In many places, due to server issues, the device did not receive proper signals. The public urged the government to address this issue. Based on the demand, the Tamil Nadu government announced that the biometric devices in the fair price shops will be replaced with new ones through Taluk Supply Officers. As per the announcement, in Salem district, the officials took back the old devices and give new biometric PoS devices to the staff after installing new software on the devices. Civil Supplies department officials said that in Salem district, out of the total 1,732 ration shops, 1,541 have PoS devices. Out of these 1,541 shops, a total of 1,233 fair price shop staff received the new devices on May 23. The old device had 2G SIM facility, which became a reason for issues in many shops. The new device has 4G SIM and printer facility. So there will be no server issues. The remaining 308 fair price shops will receive the new devices soon, the officials said.

        "content": "Jeff Messer has been coaching baseball at Slippery Rock for four decades, so he knows a good player when he sees one. When he saw Apollo-Ridge grad Brandon Butler last fall during offseason workouts, he knew he had a future standout on his hands. And the future came quickly. When fall workouts were over, Messer met with Butler — as he does with all his players — and told him how impressed he was with his hitting ability. Messer also assured Butler that he would find a place for him in the lineup. “From Day 1, he could always hit the fastball,” Messer said. “It didn’t matter who was throwing it or how hard it was thrown. ... He was our most productive hitter and best hitter in the fall, and then it was just a matter of trying to find a position we thought would be best suited for him.” Butler was installed at third base, and he rewarded Messer’s confidence. He concluded his freshman season with a .339 batting average, which was fourth on the team, and also finished fourth on the team in hits (40) and RBIs (23). And for a young man who is all of 5-foot-8 and 160 pounds, he showed surprising pop, hitting three home runs. Butler started 36 of the 37 games in which he appeared as SRU went 28-18 and 17-11 in the PSAC West. The Rock was defeated by then-No. 24 East Stroudsburg in the first round of the PSAC Tournament. “Personally, I wanted to grow and work on myself more than anything,” Butler said about his goals for his freshman season. “This season went pretty well, but I wanted to do a little bit better than I did. And, most importantly, learn. I played a lot of games, so the game reps meant a lot to me ... and playing with legit baseball players.” For all the promise Butler showed in the run-up to the season, he got off to a slow start. Over the first month, from Feb. 25 to March 30, he hit a paltry .182, collecting only six hits, and three of those were in one game. Then came the first PSAC West series of the year, against IUP, and Butler began to hit his stride. In the four-game series — The Rock won three — Butler went 6 for 13, scored twice and drove in three runs. After a two-double, two-run performance against Mansfield, he had another big PSAC West series, this time against Cal (Pa.). He went 6 for 14 with five runs scored and three RBIs. By the end of the series, his batting average had skyrocketed to .313. His average never dipped below .300 the rest of the season, topping out at .361 after a 4-for-5 performance against Gannon that also included three RBIs and a pair of runs scored. Twelve of his final 24 games were multihit outings. “I was finding a lot of barrels. I felt very comfortable at the plate and at third,” Butler said. “Before that, it was hard transitioning. ... I tell everybody that baseball is a ‘feel’ sport, so if you feel comfortable and are in that right mentality, then you’re more than likely going to do well.” Adapting to third base also had its initial challenges. Though he was recruited as an infielder, a logjam of infielders led Butler to spending most of the preseason playing outfield. But injuries among the infielders forced Messer to juggle his lineup, and a spot opened at third base. Butler had the arm necessary to play the position, but playing the so-called hot corner requires more than arm strength. “He was on-the-job training at third base for us,” Messer admitted. “He got better and better and better as the year went on. That’s one area he knows he’s working to improve on.” Added Butler: “I’ve played everywhere. I’m that guy who can bounce around and go wherever he’s needed, and we needed a third baseman. It took me a little while to get comfortable there at the college level. ... When you’re playing with grown men and the ball is hit over 100 (mph) at you, it’s a lot faster over there. “But once I got comfortable with it, I felt totally fine.” Butler committed a team-high eight errors, but Messer saw enough improvement that he said Butler likely would remain at third for the foreseeable future. Now with a year of college baseball under his belt, Butler looks forward to an offseason of work to prepare for next season. At his aforementioned exit interview, Butler was asked by Messer what his goals were for the summer. Butler quipped that he would like to grow 3 or 4 inches. Highly unlikely, but he also has a more feasible goal of putting on 10 pounds of muscle to further improve his hitting. Messer said he likes Butler’s short, quick swing that stays through the zone longer than many players. He also has been impressed with Butler’s willingness to learn to hit to all fields. That will be important, Messer said, now that opposing coaches have seen his ability to hit the fastball. “He likes to pull. He likes to use the inside of the plate, so to speak,” Messer said. “But there were balls at the end of the year that he stayed on. Even if he didn’t have a productive hit with it, he fought it off and fouled it off to where he got another pitch to hit. “He started thinking about going to the right side more rather than pulling everything to the left side. ... As more and more guys see him, they’re going to know that it’s hard to get a fastball by him.” Seton Hill’s Owen Mandler was named the PSAC West Freshman of the Year, but Messer said he believes the award easily could have gone to Butler. Still, the coach said with the trajectory Butler is on, all-conference honors are sure to follow in the near future. For his part, Butler is just looking to progress to the point that he can not only earn all-conference honors but play professionally some day. “Overall, it wasn’t bad, freshman year,” he said. “It’s a learning experience, feeling comfortable. So I’m hoping these next few years, everything should be falling into place.”",

        "content": "Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham said Monday it would be “really nice” to play with Kylian Mbappe next season. The France captain is expected to join Los Blancos at the end of his Paris Saint-Germain contract this summer. Mbappe could form an all-star attack alongside Vinicius Junior, with Madrid’s top goalscorer this season, Bellingham, offering support. “I don’t pick the team and I certainly don’t make the transfers, but Kylian Mbappe, what a player, who wouldn’t want to play with someone as good as him?”, Bellingham told reporters at a media day before the Champions League final on Saturday. “I don’t want to put any more pressure on the situation, I know for him it’s probably difficult having everyone always talking about him, but it would be really nice.” Real Madrid face Borussia Dortmund at Wembley aiming to win the competition for a record-extending 15th time. Lifting the Champions League trophy is one of the challenges Mbappe, 25, has on his to-do list. Mbappe led PSG to the French Cup last weekend in his final match for the Ligue 1 champions and said his next destination will be revealed soon. “All I wanted was to end things well with my club, with a trophy. I think there is a time for everything and I will announce my future club in good time,” said Mbappe. “I think it will be in a few days so there is no problem. “I don’t know when yet. There are still some details (to be sorted out) but the most important thing was to finish on a high here.” You must be logged in to post a comment. Why are you flagging this comment?

        "content": "Thane: Close on the heels of the Pune Porsche car crash in which two IT professionals were killed, a 17-year-old boy allegedly drove a BMW car without a license on busy streets in Kalyan with a man lying on its bonnet, prompting the police to register a case after videos of the stunt went viral. Police arrested the man lying on the car bonnet, identified as Subham Mithila, and booked the 17-year-old who was at the wheel and his father, a retired government official who owns the car, an official said on Monday. The teenager drove the car on Saturday in the busy Shivaji Chowk area in Kalyan city in Thane district. BMW car ke Bonnet par Sawari, Viral Video Kalyan ka bataya jaa raha hai, Kiya Phir Bade haadse ka intezar ? pic.twitter.com/gkMiXPBDnD “The teenager was inspired by social media reels and made his father buy the second-hand BMW car for Rs 5 lakh, and drove it on the street without a driving license,” said senior police inspector Suresh Gund. The owner of the car has been served with a notice, he said. Two IT professionals were killed after their motorcycle was hit by a speeding Porsche car allegedly driven by a minor boy in Pune in the early hours of May 19 in Kalyani Nagar area. The police claim the teenager was drunk at the time of the accident. Police in Kalyan took action after a viral video showed a youngster performing stunts on the bonnet of a moving car. The 21-year-old on the bonnet was arrested, while a teenager without a license drove the BMW around busy Shivaji Chowk. Read More🔗 https://t.co/lmlOvO8oPr pic.twitter.com/joJZPZ2L8u",

        "content": "Golf can be a stressful game. It requires perfection in almost every facet, and the slightest misstep can send the ball off in an unintended direction. Franklin Regional grad Michael Wareham, however, said he finds sanctuary on the golf course. Sure, the tournaments he plays with his Gannon teammates are fraught with pressure, but golf offers him relief from stress, particularly during practice times. Perhaps that’s why he spends countless hours honing his craft. “I think golf is so cool because you can go out there for hours on end and just do something different for each and every hour,” said Wareham, who just wrapped up his junior year with the Golden Knights. “There’s so many things to improve on and practice, whether it be bunker shots, short-game shots, punch shots, your tee balls, your wedges, irons, putting. “You can sit there for hours upon hours. I also think it’s a nice way to relax and take your mind off things.” Gannon men’s golf coach Dustin Coleman, with 12 seasons at the helm, said he is struck by Wareham’s dedication to the game. Wareham, he said, always is leading the way when it comes to encouraging teammates to go to the range for extra practice or play nine more holes. “He cares about golf and cares about the team just about more than anyone we have,” Coleman said. With Wareham in the fold, it might not be a coincidence that the Golden Knights won their first regional title and qualified for their first NCAA championship during his freshman season. Gannon went back to the NCAAs this year after winning another Atlantic Regional title. Wareham led the charge, shooting 69-68 over the first two rounds to take the individual lead and help the Golden Knights get off to a fast start. He closed with a 76 to go even par for the tournament and finish runner-up to teammate Shaunak Rama. The 68 matched the low round of his collegiate career, which he set earlier in the season at the Dr. Wally Edgell Invitational at Canaan Valley Resort Golf Club in Davis, W.Va. His 18-hole average of 74.3 was a personal best, improving by nearly 1.5 strokes from last season. “I think just growing mentally has been the biggest thing,” Wareham said about his steady improvement. “I don’t think my game has changed that much. ... This year, I’ve been able to get under par and continue to just try and attack flags and make low numbers and keep it going. “And I think one of the biggest things is the putter has been really, really good this year. Probably the biggest physical improvement in my game is the putter.” Along with that, Coleman said, he can see Wareham becoming more confident in his game. “He’s been around the block, and now he’s starting to realize, ‘Yeah, I am one of the best players here,’ ” Coleman said. “I think he knows that. I think sometimes he thought that and tried to convince himself of that ... but now I think he finally believes it.” Besides hours of practice, Wareham said his game has gotten a boost from becoming a member at Hannastown Golf Club. The course counts some of the top amateur players in Western Pennsylvania among its regulars, and Wareham has been able to match his game against players such as Sean Knapp and Palmer Jackson. “It’s a good challenge,” Wareham said of Hannastown. “The greens are always really good. It requires you to do everything well. ... Since I joined there, I have seen great improvements in my game. That comes with playing with great players, playing on a tough course every day, tough conditions.” Jackson, also a Franklin Regional grad, has been a mentor for Wareham. A couple of years older, Jackson, who is concluding his graduate year with the Notre Dame golf team, showed Wareham what was required to play high-level golf. “We’re still really good friends,” Wareham said. “Back in those days, when I was younger, he kind of showed me what really good golf looks like. ... I think he’s had a big impact on my golf career.” It’s a career Wareham hopes lasts beyond college. He still has one more season to play at Gannon, and after that, he said, he will see where the sport takes him. Naturally, he would like to play professionally, but any type of career around the game, he said, would be welcome. Coleman said he believes Wareham has the chops to play at the highest level. Golf, he said, is a sport in which most players don’t reach their peak until around age 30, so, in his estimation, Wareham isn’t close to his prime. Wareham has all the shots. Though not the longest player off the tee, he makes up for it with accuracy and a solid wedge game and putting. The last piece of the puzzle: learning how to win. As much as Wareham enjoys the team accolades — “He’s the No. 1 ‘team’ guy,” Coleman said — he said he wants an individual victory before he leaves the college game. He has come close, finishing as runner-up four times. But the win remains elusive. He was right there for the regional championship before a shaky start to the third round derailed his charge. “Being in that position in the final round was something new for me, being in a four-shot lead,” he said. “I was pretty nervous on that first tee, and I think it’s something I can take and learn from. “It’s funny. I’ve been so close a bunch of times. The biggest goal this year was trying to get a win. But I’ve seen a lot of improvement, and I’ve put myself in position to win plenty of times, so that’s a very promising thing to see.” Coleman said he believes it is only a matter of time. “I think he just needs to get it the one time, and the rest will be a lot easier for him,” he said. “It’s coming. We keep telling him, it’s coming.”",

        "description": "Sir Keir Starmer said claims he lacked the stamina for an election campaign were ‘desperate’.",
        "content": "Sir Keir Starmer hit back at accusations he lacked the energy for the General Election campaign, saying he had been smiling since the start of the year at the prospect of a public vote. Conservatives claimed on Sunday the Labour leader does not have the “stamina” to campaign, saying he had been “resting at home”, although pictures later emerged of Sir Keir meeting voters in Brighton. Speaking at a campaign event in Lancing, West Sussex, on Monday, Sir Keir dismissed the claims as “desperate”. He said: “I’ve had a smile on my face since January 1 2024 because I knew this was going to be an election year. “I’ve wasted nine years of my life in opposition. I’ve worked four-and-a-half years to change this Labour Party, and now I’ve got the chance to take that to the country. “So we’re doing that not only with energy, but with a smile, with positivity across all of our candidates as we go into this election.” In seeking to make 61-year-old Sir Keir’s age an issue, Conservative strategists have appeared to emulate US presidential candidate Donald Trump’s attacks on 81-year-old president Joe Biden. Mr Trump has repeatedly characterised his opponent as “Sleepy Joe”, while one Tory aide has reportedly described Sir Keir as “Sir Sleepy”, in contrast to the younger Rishi Sunak. On the same theme, Tory chairman Richard Holden described Sir Keir’s speech on Monday as “wearisome and rambling”. Taking questions from the media after his speech in Lancing, the Labour leader also took aim at Mr Sunak, saying it was “farcical” for someone who had been “standing in the rain without an umbrella” to claim he was the only person with a plan. The Prime Minister’s key campaign messages have so far focused on the Conservatives having a “clear plan” for the country while claiming Labour has “no plan”. Mr Sunak distanced himself from the Tory attacks on Sir Keir. The 44-year-old Prime Minister said “the substance is what matters” following the comments about his rival. Mr Sunak told reporters: “I’m interested in getting out and about across the country. “We’re a few days into this, we’ve been in the East Midlands, the West Midlands, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, here in the South East today, talking to people – parents – about the future. “The substance is what matters at this election, it’s a choice about the future.” He added: “When it comes to Keir Starmer, that’s the choice that’s on offer – no ideas, no plan and you don’t deliver a better future, you don’t deliver any change, without those things.”",

        "content": "By BL New Delhi Bureau Comments READ LATER The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) said it has blacklisted eight SMS Headers for sending fraudulent communications for committing cyber-crime, in collaboration with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). It was noted that more than 10,000 fraudulent messages were sent using these eight headers in the past three months and in its action, all the 73 SMS headers and 1,522 SMS content templates owned by these Principal Entities (PEs) have been blacklisted and none of these PEs, SMS headers or templates can now be used to send SMS through any telecom operator, the DoT said. “DoT, in collaboration with the MHA, has taken decisive action to protect citizens from potential SMS fraud through the Sanchar Saathi initiative. Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C), MHA, provided information about misuse of eight SMS Headers for sending fraudulent communications for committing cyber-crime,” it said. DoT reiterates its commitment to safeguarding citizens against cybercrime. Citizens can report suspected fraud communications at the Chakshu facility on Sanchar Saathi to help DoT in the prevention of misuse of telecom resources for cyber-crime and financial frauds, it said. The DoT also noted that it does not permit use of mobile numbers for telemarketing activities and if a consumer uses their telephone connection to send promotional messages, their connection will be liable for disconnection on the first complaint and their name and address may be blacklisted for a period of two years. Telemarketing calls can be identified by their prefixes: 180, 140 and 10-digit numbers are not permitted for telemarketing, it said adding that to report spam, consumers can dial 1909 or use the DND (Do Not Disturb) service. Also read: Tech start-ups can seek DoT nod directly for beta testing services: TRAI On Sunday also, the DoT said that it has been reported that fraudsters are making international spoofed calls displaying Indian mobile numbers to Indian citizens and committing cyber-crime and financial frauds. Such calls appear to be originating within India but are being made by cyber-criminals from abroad by manipulating the calling line identity (CLI) and have been misused in recent cases of fake digital arrests, FedEx scams, drugs or narcotics in courier, impersonation as government and police officials, disconnections of mobile numbers by DoT or TRAI officials, etc. The incoming international spoofed calls with Indian landline numbers are being already blocked by the telecom service providers (TSPs) as per the directions issued by DoT, it added.

        "content": "In the annals of Philippine cinema, few names resonate with the enduring legacy of Eva Darren, an actress whose career has spanned decades and whose contributions to the film industry have been nothing short of iconic. However, recent events have cast a shadow over Darren’s illustrious career, as she finds herself at the center of a social media backlash against the Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS). Eva Darren’s illustrious career, marked by memorable roles in films such as “Ang Langit sa Lupa” and “Brides of Blood,” has solidified her status as a cinematic icon. Her impressive versatility and talent have also shone through in notable television appearances in beloved series like “Mula sa Puso” and “May Bukas Pa,” further endearing her to audiences. Her contributions to the entertainment industry have enriched Philippine cinema and television and inspired countless artists and viewers, making her a beloved and influential figure. Her distinguished career, extending over several decades, is characterized by her dynamic performances in both cinematic and television realms. In 1998, her role in the critically lauded film ‘Ligaya Ang Itawag Mo Sa Akin’ (1997) earned her a Gawad Urian nomination for Best Supporting Actress, highlighting her exceptional talent alongside Rosanna Roces. Darren’s depiction of Belen Macaspac in the acclaimed ABS-CBN television series ‘Pangako Sa ‘Yo’ (2000) profoundly resonated with viewers, especially in her role as the adoptive mother of the character portrayed by Kristine Hermosa. Her significant portrayal as a fortuneteller in ‘Sineserye Presents: Patayin Sa Sindak si Barbara’ (2008), co-starring Kris Aquino, further reinforced her esteemed standing. Additionally, in 2008, she appeared in the film ‘Ate,’ alongside Ara Mina and Cristine Reyes, showcasing her versatility. Throughout her expansive career in television, she has assumed various roles, manifesting her adeptness across multiple genres. Her career commenced with ‘Hiwaga sa Bahay na Bato’ in 1963, setting the stage for a prolific career. She continued to engage audiences in episodes of ‘Maalaala Mo Kaya,’ with notable roles such as Lydia in ‘Dancing Shoes’ (1994) and Selma in ‘Lupa’ (1995). Her portrayals as Josefina “Pining” Miranda in ‘Mula sa Puso’ (1997) and Editha in ‘Marinella’ (1999) stand out as particularly memorable. Darren’s skills were evident in series like ‘Darating ang Umaga’ (2003), ‘Now and Forever’ (2005-2006), and ‘Komiks Presents: Pedro Penduko at ang mga Engkantao’ (2007). In more recent years, she has appeared in ‘The Rich Man’s Daughter’ (2015), ‘Wish I May’ (2016), and ‘Kadenang Ginto’ (2018), further contributing to the Philippine entertainment industry with her extraordinary performances. The recent incident at the FAMAS Awards has reignited discussions about the immense respect and recognition that veteran artists like Eva Darren deserve. Her legacy and the impact of her work underscore the need for the industry to honor and uphold the contributions of those who have shaped its history. This event has amplified calls for greater appreciation and acknowledgment of the veterans whose artistry and dedication have paved the way for future generations, highlighting their critical role in the continued evolution of Philippine entertainment. Eva Darren’s son, Fernando de la Pena, voiced his and his mother’s dismay in a heartfelt social media post titled “A Moment of Debacle at the FAMAS Awards Night.” Despite preferring a quiet family life, he detailed how his mother had eagerly prepared for the event, buying a new dress and investing in professional styling, only to be sidelined in a bewildering turn of events. Despite adverse weather, Darren made it to the Manila Hotel, only to be replaced on stage by a young singer, leaving her and her family in shock and seeking answers from the FAMAS PR team, which only offered apologies but no accountability. The incident not only represented a personal affront to Darren, who had not been featured on the FAMAS stage since 1969 when she won Best Supporting Actress, but also highlighted issues of professionalism and respect within the organization. FAMAS’s response, attributing the mishap to logistical errors and misjudgment, did little to quell the growing indignation among the public and the artistic community, who saw it as a grave disrespect to a revered figure in the industry. The controversy has sparked a broader conversation about how veteran artists are treated in the entertainment industry. It has questioned the integrity and operational competency of award-giving bodies like FAMAS. It underscores the need for these organizations to honor and respect all artists’ contributions and reflect on their practices to avoid such disrespectful incidents in the future. In response to the backlash, FAMAS issued a public apology, stating that the failure to locate Ms. Darren during the live show was “negligence on the part of the team” and not intentional. They expressed their commitment to making amends and rebuilding trust, including a visit by the FAMAS Board to honor Darren’s stature if she allows it. This moment has highlighted the challenges veteran actors face in the industry and sparked a conversation about the treatment of esteemed artists. As the dust settles on this unfortunate episode, one thing remains clear: Eva Darren’s legacy is etched in the history of Philippine cinema, and no oversight can diminish her contributions to the art form she has helped shape and define.

        "content": "Innovative technologies are steadily penetrating into all spheres of human life, and gambling is no exception. Not so long ago, online cryptocurrency platforms were hard to even imagine, but today they are gradually becoming commonplace. One of the first such brands was BC Game, founded by BlockDance BV in 2017. Since then, the platform has gone through several stages of its development, expanded the list of services provided, and significantly improved their quality. BC Game casino has been repeatedly nominated for the title of “Casino of the Year” according to various organisations and several times the institution managed to win. BC Game is currently operated by Small House BV (since 1 May 2024) and operates under licence OGL/2023/159/0076 issued by the Curaçao Gambling Control Board (GCB). This document authorises operations in many countries around the world, including the Philippines. BC Game Features and Benefits To begin with, although BC Game is considered a cryptocurrency platform, it is possible to make a deposit to your gaming account using some traditional means of payment – bank cards and mobile payments (GooglePay, ApplePay and SamsungPay). This is very convenient for those Filipino bettors who are not yet too familiar with cryptocurrencies and makes it much easier to log into the game. As for the rest of BC Game’s features, the following can be highlighted: As for BC Game’s support service, it is available in a 24/7 live chat as well as via email. The first option, of course, is faster, so we advise you to use it if necessary. Welcome and Other Bonuses Offered by BC Game For convenience and clarity, all the amounts in this section will be specified in American dollars (USD), just like on the operator’s official website. And one more nuance – if you have BC Game bonus code, don’t forget to activate it to get additional benefits. BC Game has quite a lot of different offers, so let’s focus on the main ones: You will never be bored in BC Game. There are daily and weekly tasks available here (mostly they are related to various activities in BC Game casino), the administration of the platform regularly conducts various promotions and tournaments, distributes BC Game bonus codes that open access to various rewards. So, we advise you to take advantage of all the opportunities that BC Game offers to Filipino players.",

        "content": "The Kundapura taluk administration on Monday promised to conduct a joint survey to identify land to be distributed to Koragas in the taluk, following an agitation by members of the Karnataka Adivasigala Hakkugala Samanvaya Samiti. Samiti members, under the leadership of Udupi district convener Sridhar Nada, sat on a protest in front of the Alur Gram Panchayat office in the taluk on Monday. They said the government had failed to allocate land to the community as per the Mohammed Peer report despite the samiti making several representations. Though government land was identified for distribution, the Revenue Department did not conduct the survey, after initially identifying about 10 acres. As the department failed to initiate land distribution in the second phase, the samiti organised the protest, Mr. Nada said. Later, Kundapura tahsildar Shobha Lakshmi and other officials arrived at the spot and received the memorandum. Ms. Lakshmi told the samiti members that there was a delay in conducting the survey and said that she would order an immediate joint survey to be conducted on June 10. The tahsildar also promised to allocate more land to the community and urged the samiti members to withdraw their protest. Following the assurance, the members withdrew their protest, said Mr. Nada in a statement. Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

Revanna, father of prime accused Prajwal Revanna in the sex scandal case, on Monday said that that he is not aware whether former PM H.D. Deve Gowda wrote a letter to his son. \"I don't know anything about the letter by Deve Gowda,\" Mr Revanna told media persons after visiting the Manjunatha temple in Dharmasthala in Dakshina Kannada district. Earlier, it was reported that former Prime Minister Deve Gowda had told Prajwal to immediately appear before the SIT or face isolation from the family. \"I am in politics for four decades and served people as the Holenarasipura assembly constituency MLA for 25 years. I have faith in the law of the land and I trust Lord Manjunatha,\" he said. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com Mr Revanna said that since the case is in the court it would not be appropriate to comment about it. \"I have great respect for the law but at this juncture, it would be wrong to make remarks,\" he said.

        "description": "The number of campus placements has more than doubled this year compared to last year, says Director of Technical Education C. Nagarani",
        "content": "Nearly 12,000 out of the 25,000 polytechnic students, who graduated from both government and private polytechnic colleges in the State for the academic year 2023-24, have been selected through campus placements by various companies, including some major firms and industries. “The placements have more than doubled compared to the last academic year and about four times compared to 2021-22. This year the highest package of ₹8.6 LPA was offered by ‘Texas Instruments’ for the post of lab interns to Electronics (ECE) students and nine were selected,” Director of Technical Education C. Nagarani, told The Hindu at an event held at Government Polytechnic, here on Monday. Similarly, ‘Thoughtworks’ offered ₹8 LPA for the post of software developer to Computer Science students and 35 were selected. Some other companies include Amar Raja, AM/NS, MEIL, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Maruti Suzuki and Royal Enfield. The starting package in the other companies ranges between ₹2.4 lakh and ₹3.2 lakh for various positions like technician apprentice, trainee and assistant trainee. “This is only the starting salary and after three to four years of experience, they can expect a substantial increase,” Ms. Nagarani says. To improve polytechnic students’ job prospects, she said that the Commissionerate has introduced Classroom Recruitment Training (CRT), academia-industry collaboration workshops are being held to bridge the gap between academic learning and industry requirements and knowledge exchange between educators, industry professionals and students. Centralised placement drives “Placements are normally conducted at the college level, but we have introduced multi-level placement drives at three levels — polytechnic, cluster and Commissionerate/central level — to ensure that students of government, aided and private polytechnics have access to a wide range of opportunities,” she said. She added that the centralised placement drives ensure higher recruitment. “We release a State-level link for student registration, pre-placement talks, examination and interview, announcement of results and issuance of offer letters. We monitor the entire process online, which is particularly beneficial to students in polytechnics in towns like Paderu, Cheepurupalli, Chodavaram and Addanki,” she said. “Texas Instruments, which usually selects B.Tech graduates from IITs and NITs agreed to select polytechnic students from Andhra Pradesh due to the central-level efforts. To track placement progress, the Commissioner’s office implemented a web portal, a real-time monitoring system, with weekly tracking of placements,” she added.

        "content": "Frankfurt, Germany: German business sentiment stagnated in May after several months of improvement, a survey showed Monday, denting hopes that Europe's biggest economy is on course for a strong recovery. The Ifo institute's closely-watched confidence barometer, based on a survey of around 9,000 companies, came in at 89.3 points. It was the same reading as in April, and lower than a forecast of 90.3 from analysts surveyed by financial data firm FactSet. Prior to May, the survey had risen for three consecutive months, fuelling hopes the economy would stage a strong rebound after shrinking last year as it faced myriad headwinds. Despite the unchanged reading, Ifo president Clemens Fuest struck an upbeat note. \"Germany's economy is working its way out of the crisis step by step,\" he said in a statement. Companies were less satisfied with their current business situation but expectations improved, the survey showed. It pointed to improvements in the manufacturing, trade and construction sectors but the picture in the service sector worsened. ING economist Carsten Brzeski said the latest reading represented a \"cold shower to optimists\". It \"suggests that the bottoming out of the German economy is not yet being followed by a strong recovery,\" he said. But Fritzi Koehler-Geib, chief economist at public lender KfW, said there was still a \"little more confidence\" in German companies than just a few months earlier. \"Although the business climate stagnated in May, it remains at a significantly higher level than at the beginning of the year. All in all, the economic trough should be largely over.\" The German economy was hit hard after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 sent energy costs soaring, with the crisis compounded by a manufacturing slowdown and weakness in key trading partners, particularly China. Recovery hopes had been driven in recent months by a string of improving indicators. The German government also nudged up its 2024 growth forecast last month to 0.3 percent, from 0.2 percent previously.",

        "content": "In a bid to combat the rising tide of digital scams, Mastercard and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have forged a strategic partnership. Under the banner of a Memorandum of Understanding, the two entities are pooling their resources to deepen the understanding of the developmental impact of digital scams and to devise effective strategies for detection and mitigation. Digital scams have emerged as a formidable global challenge, exacting staggering financial losses and wreaking havoc on individuals and communities worldwide. Despite the enormity of the problem, much of it remains hidden, with countless incidents going unreported. These scams not only impede progress toward development goals but also corrode the trust essential for fostering an inclusive digital transformation, particularly in developing nations. Recognizing the imperative for a collaborative, multi-stakeholder approach, the UNDP Global Centre for Technology, Innovation, and Sustainable Development in Singapore is spearheading a global coalition. This coalition aims to unite international and local public and private sector entities, as well as civil society, in a concerted effort to comprehensively understand the impact of digital scams on development, with a specific focus on developing countries. Mastercard, renowned for its expertise in safeguarding global networks, is the first private sector organization to join this coalition. Its participation underscores the company’s commitment to bolstering global and regional initiatives aimed at fortifying the cyber resilience of digital economies. Leveraging its extensive experience and technological prowess in combatting fraud, Mastercard will provide invaluable insights, best practices, and industry expertise to elevate cybersecurity standards and combat digital scams. Marcos Neto, UN Assistant Secretary-General and Director of UNDP’s Bureau for Policy and Programme Support, emphasized the urgency of the endeavor, highlighting Mastercard’s pivotal role in augmenting the coalition’s capabilities. Ari Sarker, President, Asia Pacific, Mastercard, echoed this sentiment, stressing the importance of fostering trust in an interconnected world plagued by increasingly sophisticated online scams. Looking ahead, the global coalition will undertake an in-depth analysis of the socio-economic ramifications of digital scams and formulate a comprehensive framework to address these multifaceted challenges. Special attention will be devoted to developing countries, where the impact of such scams is most acutely felt. The insights gleaned from this initiative will inform the creation of a toolkit comprising strategies, best practices, and capacity-building resources aimed at galvanizing collaborative action against digital scams on a global scale.",

        "description": "Dozens of accommodation centres for Ukrainian refugees are set to close, the Taoiseach has said.",
        "content": "Almost 70 contracts for Ukrainian refugee accommodation will expire “shortly”, according to Simon Harris. Mr Harris said that many hotel and community facilities which were being used as refugee accommodation will made available again for local use. Speaking to Ireland AM on Virgin Media, Mr Harris said that the state needs to move “beyond this emergency response” to migration. “Firstly, we need to stop taking the only hotel in the town and there is some good news in relation to this,” he added. “In Co Kerry, for example, we’ve been able to put two hotels that had been used for migration back into use. There are 68 contracts currently being used for Ukrainian accommodation that will not be used shortly and that we’ll see many hotels and other facilities coming back into their community, that’s important for communities to see and to know. “The second thing though is, and I’ve been very honest about this, we have to stop the conversation about migration only being about accommodation. “If you do that you’re going to completely lose the people in this country, you’re going to see a breakdown in social cohesion. “I believe very strongly that Irish people are compassionate. I really believe it. Irish communities have done an incredible job. “We have taken a number of measures to show people that there’s a rules based system, that if you come here and you don’t have a right to be here, you’re going to find out about that quicker and be asked to leave, that our welfare system is there to support you, but it’s never open to abuse.” In recent months the Government has introduced tighter rules around welfare supports for asylum seekers and Ukrainians. Last week, the Government announced plans to means-test asylum seekers. Social Protection Minister Heather Humphreys is currently looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, following a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than 125 euro a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of 232 euro to 38.80 euro per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in state-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year.",

The old man who can't define a woman who thinks he was the VP during COVID wants to protect science from Trump. Alrighty then. Biden’s got a plan to protect science from Trump https://t.co/u9lgvGIg0J From POLITICO: In an effort to Trump-proof, NIH has designated an official to identify political meddling in the agency’s work and is tasking a soon-to-be-established scientific integrity council with reviewing those cases. The White House knows Trump could still cast those plans aside but is calculating that doing so will set off alarms with the media, Congress and the public. The Biden administration likely hopes GOP lawmakers, even those who think the NIH needs an overhaul, will temper Trump’s moves. “Interfering and manipulating science to hit a partisan agenda is inappropriate and is what we’re working to wall against,” Lyric Jorgenson, NIH’s designated scientific integrity official, said in an interview. She added: The plan to protect the agency’s independence is critical because the public needs to be able to rely on NIH to “generate rigorous, trusted evidence to inform public health.” Trump-proof? Really? If only Trump had Biden-Proofed the entire country ... Oh, please 😂 “An official to designate political meddling?” Does that include people like Fauci who for political reason his the origin of Covid? Of course not. This is only for conservatives who the unelected bureaucrats believe are getting in their way The folks who can’t define what a woman is has decided to protect science from the people who can????

        "description": "Pakistan to revive China Belt and Road initiative projects",
        "content": "Pakistan ’s new government is hoping to inject some fresh momentum into projects that fall under China’s Belt and Road Initiative, as it tries to boost the country’s troubled economy. The South Asian nation is looking at joint ventures for renewable energy projects , agriculture collaboration and possibly enticing some Chinese companies to relocate to Pakistan, said Ahsan Iqbal, Pakistan’s federal minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, who also co-heads the committee responsible for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , in an interview. “Yeah, I’m very hopeful because I was there in China recently and I had meetings with their senior leadership,” said Iqbal at his office in Islamabad, decorated with a large map showcasing the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. “So I see great interest on the Chinese side to revive the momentum for CPEC and also to take it into the second phase.” Pakistan was seen as a flagship destination for BRI projects , with CPEC — which includes a port in the southern town of Gwadar and new power plants — the crown jewel. The progress on new projects stalled in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and amid Pakistan’s on-going economic difficulties that have required the International Monetary Fund’s intervention. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who was elected to a second successive term in February, has been looking to revive economic cooperation with China for the past two years. Sharif’s older brother, Nawaz, led the country when Pakistan signed on to the BRI in 2013. Projects worth about $25 billion came online in the first phase, including power plants that ended the nation’s chronic power deficit. A Pakistani committee approved a long-delayed railway upgrade project last week — but scaled it down from $10 billion to $6.8 billion. The project will be done in two phases “so there is not a big burden on Pakistan,” said Iqbal. The railway, in its first phase will run from Karachi, the southern coast city, to Multan, a little over halfway to the capital, Islamabad. The Sharif government has also finished some key BRI projects that were pending for years: a water-supply project in Gwadar, dredging work at the port and an electricity transmission line from Iran. “So all these things really help China see that the new government is again serious and it restored their confidence that now Pakistan is, you know, serious about CPEC initiatives ,” said Iqbal. China has also been a key financial lender, alongside the IMF, with its loans helping Pakistan avoid bankruptcy. The country is struggling with low growth and the fastest rising consumer prices in Asia. Islamabad’s difficulties have seen it fall behind on payments related to Chinese-funded power plants. To mark the tenth anniversary of CPEC last year, China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng unveiled five new corridors including one focused on growth to boost economic activity in Pakistan. The others are related to livelihood, innovation, green energy and regional connectivity. Sharif is likely to visit China soon, said Iqbal. One change in the second phase would likely involve Islamabad taking a step back while urging the private sector to forge partnerships with Chinese firms. The other big focus, albeit a long-shot prospect, is to try and attract Chinese firms thinking of relocating from China amid rising labor costs and heightening geopolitical tensions. “That would be a success because at the moment more than 80 million jobs are being relocated from China to other countries because of the high level cost in China,” said Iqbal. “They have gone to Vietnam and you know, Laos and Cambodia. There is now overcrowding there. So they are certainly looking for new places.”",

Profits at China’s industrial companies rose 4% at an annualized pace in April, compared with March’s 3.5% decrease which ended seven consecutive months of rises. April’s uptick was led by the government’s stimulus measures which came into effect to boost the economy and a recovery in exports. In January-April, industrial profit went up by 4.3% from a year ago to 2.09 trillion yuan ($289 billion). State-owned industrial companies saw a 2.8% fall in profits in the 4-month period, foreign companies ran a 16.7% rise and private companies a 6.4% increase. Profits of computer, communication and other electric equipment manufacturers soared 76% year-on-year in the first four months of 2024.",

        "content": "LONDON (Reuters): The European Central Bank (ECB) is ready to start cutting interest rates next month, but policy must continue to be restrictive this year as wage growth will not normalize until 2026, its chief economist Philip Lane told the Financial Times. The ECB has all but promised a rate cut for June 6, so the debate has shifted to subsequent moves, and markets have dialed back their expectations, betting on just one more cut this year. “Barring major surprises, at this point in time, there is enough in what we see to remove the top level of restriction,” Lane told the FT in an interview published on Monday. “The best way to frame the debate this year is that we still need to be restrictive all year long,” he added. “But within the zone of restrictiveness, we can move down somewhat.” While Lane made no explicit comment about the July policy meeting, a string of policymakers, including fellow board member Isabel Schnabel, have already said that a second step should not come so soon. Wage growth is expected to “visibly” decelerate next year, and policymakers can then debate normalizing policy. At 4%, the ECB’s deposit rate holds back growth, and there is little debate that the first few cuts, at least until 3% but possibly further, merely remove restriction rather than provide stimulus. “We need to see more progress (on inflation) before we move from maintaining the restrictive phase to thinking about normalization,” Lane added. Lane said ECB policymakers needed to keep rates in the restrictive territory this year to ensure that inflation kept easing and did not get stuck above the bank’s target, which “would be very problematic and probably quite painful to eliminate.” A key wage indicator accelerated last week, spooking some, but Lane said the figure was well anticipated and a slowdown was already in the works. “Deceleration does not necessarily mean an immediate return to steady state,” Lane said. “This year, the adjustment is clearly quite gradual.”",

        "description": "People are companies are moving to cheaper places with lower taxes, and Kyle Bass is buying up land in those locations.",
        "content": "Billionaire investor Kyle Bass is scooping up land in Florida, Tennessee, and Texas, touting the states' upside potential as both workers and companies shift to more affordable markets. \"When you think about the US, you look at the coastal region, the West Coast and the Northeast being very high cost, very high tax — one could say mismanaged — jurisdictions,\" he said in a recent interview with Investor's Podcast Network. \"They're moving to pro-business, lower costs, lower, or no-tax jurisdictions.\" Bass' success in real estate is well established. His winning bet against the 2008 housing market was immortalized in the classic book \"The Big Short.\" And his focus on property in lower-cost states is a strategy he's pursued for years now, offering a similar explanation in 2022. Between then and last year, Florida's population jumped over 365,000, while Texas grew by more than 473,000, census data shows. Tennessee's population climbed 77,513. Meanwhile, the exodus of large firms from states such as California and New York has weighed heavily on those markets, with $1 trillion worth of assets having moved away over the past three years, Bloomberg found. \"You have to move real companies where there's affordability, where there's expansive activity, where there are natural resources to accommodate that movement, so I want to buy real estate in front of that macro movement,\" the Hayman Capital founder said. Related stories But Bass' attention on land doesn't stop there. By expanding his holdings, he's also looking to capitalize on environmental mitigation, a market that sells credit to firms that want to offset the ecological impact of their operations. To that end, Bass established Conservation Equity Management in 2021, a private equity firm that sells federal credits in exchange for services such as wetland repair on owned property. \"As more companies and people move to Texas and other pro-business, low-tax states, there will be devastating environmental consequences, forcing firms to consider their physical environmental impacts, carbon footprints and mitigation options,\" he said in 2022. By September of that year, the firm had snapped up $90 million worth of properties in Texas alone, Bloomberg reported. By then, the price-per-acre of rural land had appreciated 123% over the decade , the outlet cited. But price appreciation isn't Bass' only reason for buying so much land. He also touted property investments as a significant hedge against macroeconomic uncertainties. He previously noted a preference for land over gold as a safe haven. \"When I think about gold versus rural land again, I have the population demographic in my tailwind,\" he said in 2022. \"I also have something that I can drive to.\" As to forthcoming risks, Bass' main concern is China. He says economic turmoil in the country, as well as the threat of geopolitical fallout with the US, offers little room for market positivity. This story was originally published in March 2024.",

        "content": "BEIJING (Reuters): China has established its third planned state-backed investment fund to boost its semiconductor industry, with a registered capital of 344 billion yuan ($47.5 billion), the filing with a government-run companies registry showed. The hundreds of billions of yuan invested in the sector puts into perspective President Xi Jinping’s drive to achieve self-sufficiency for China in semiconductors. That commitment has taken on renewed urgency after the U.S. imposed a series of export control measures over the last couple of years, citing fears Beijing could use advanced chips to boost its military capabilities. Chinese chip shares rose, with the CES CN Semiconductor Index rallying more than 3% and set to log the biggest one-day gain in more than a month. The third phase of the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund was officially established on May 24 and registered under the Beijing Municipal Administration for Market Regulation, according to the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System, a government-run credit information agency. The third phase will be the largest of the three funds launched by the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, known as the “Big Fund.” China’s finance ministry is the biggest shareholder with a 17% stake and paid-in capital of 60 billion yuan, according to Tianyancha, a Chinese companies information database company. China Development Bank Capital is the second-largest shareholder with a 10.5% stake. The Ministry of Finance didn’t immediately reply to Reuters request for comment Seventeen other entities are listed as investors, including five major Chinese banks: Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications with each contributing around 6% of the total capital. Reuters reported in September that China would launch the third phase of the Big Fund. The first phase of the fund was established in 2014 with a registered capital of 138.7 billion yuan, and the second phase followed in 2019 with 204 billion yuan. The Big Fund has provided financing to China’s two biggest chip foundries, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, and Hua Hong Semiconductor, as well as to Yangtze Memory Technologies, a manufacturer specialized in flash memory chips, and several smaller companies and funds. One of the major areas the third phase of the fund will focus on is equipment for chip manufacturing, Reuters reported in September. Also, the Big Fund is considering hiring at least two institutions to invest the capital from the third phase.",

        "content": "QNA DOHA: QatarEnergy has announced that the consortium partners in the Sepia joint venture have taken the final investment decision (FID) for the second development phase of the Sepia field, located in the prolific pre-salt Santos Basin, offshore Brazil. The Sepia joint venture is a partnership between QatarEnergy, TotalEnergies, Petronas, Petrogal Brazil, and Petrobras (the operator). The FID was marked by the signing of a contract with Seatrium O&G Americas Limited to construct a floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) unit to operate in the ultra-deep waters of the Sepia field. The FPSO will have a crude oil production capacity of 225,000 barrels of oil per day and a gas processing capacity of ten million cubic meters per day. Minister of State for Energy Affairs, the President and CEO of QatarEnergy HE Saad bin Sherida Al Kaabi welcomed the award of the contract as an important landmark in QatarEnergy's activities in Brazil. The FPSO is expected to result in reducing greenhouse gas emission intensity per barrel of oil equivalent by 30 percent. The reduction is due to the benefits of an all-electric configuration and optimizations in the processing plant to increase energy efficiency. The FPSO also incorporates several environmental technologies, such as zero routine ventilation (recovery of ventilated gases from cargo tanks and the processing), deep seawater capture, use of speed variations in pumps and compressors, cogeneration (Waste Heat Recovery Unit), routine zero burning (torch gas recovery closed flare), valves with requirements for low fugitive emissions and the capture, use and geological storage of CO2 from the gas produced. The FPSO's construction will be carried out in shipyards in Brazil, China, and Singapore. It will be the second FPSO in the Sepia field (in addition to the already operating Carioca FPSO) and will target the northern part of the Sepia field. Copy 27/05/2024 15",

TAIPEI, TAIWAN – Standing across from Taiwan’s newly elected president on Monday, House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, drew a stark parallel between China’s hostility toward the island and the tension that wracked the globe during World War II. \"All democracies must stand together against aggression and tyranny, whether it's [Vladimir Putin] and Russia, the ayatollah of Iran, or Chairman Xi next door to us in China – an unholy alliance is eroding peace around the world,\" McCaul said. \"Not since World War II, my father's war, have we seen such blatant violence and naked aggression.\" The Texas Republican is leading a multi-day diplomatic trip to Taipei with a bipartisan coalition of House lawmakers. The group met with Taiwanese President Lai Ching-tse and Foreign Minister Jaushieh Joseph Wu on their first full day – the first U.S. delegation to meet with the new officials since they took office a little over a week ago. \"I gave them some updates on the weapons and some other things we're doing to help them, but they just wanted me to know that the threat was getting very intense from Chairman Xi,\" McCaul told Fox News Digital after the meetings. CHINA’S FOREIGN MINISTRY BLASTS TAIWAN INAUGURATION, PHILIPPINES STANDOFF IN SOUTH CHINA SEA House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul met with Taiwanese President Lai despite threats from Chinese leader Xi Jinping. (Getty Images | House Committee on Foreign Affairs) Rep. Young Kim, R-Calif., chair of the Foreign Affairs panel's Indo-Pacific subcommittee, told Fox News Digital, \"I thought both meetings went very productively today, we had frank conversations.\" \"In all of our conversations, one thing was made very clear. Nobody wants conflict in the Taiwan Strait,\" Kim said. \"Our goal is not to think about an invasion or a potential conflict, our goal is to ensure there is that deterrence by providing Taiwan what they need to protect themselves and defend themselves.\" The delegation is also made up of House Taiwan Caucus co-chair Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., as well as Reps. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., Jimmy Panetta, D-Calif., and Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa. Both the Taiwanese and U.S. leaders made clear that China’s aggression in the Indo-Pacific is creating an increasingly dire situation. It comes days after China encircled the island with dozens of warships and military planes as \"punishment\" for Lai’s advocacy for a free and independent Taiwan, according to Beijing's Defense Ministry.

( Gui Xinhua/PLA/China Military/Anadolu via Getty Images) During his remarks to media after the lawmakers’ meeting with Lai, Foreign Minister Wu darkly joked that China had \"welcomed\" the U.S. delegation with its military drills. McCaul called it an \"intimidation tactic to punish democracy.\" \"They don't like democracy. I know Chairman Xi would often tell [Former Taiwanese President Tsai] that... democracy doesn't work. Democracy is dysfunctional, democracy is broken,\" he said during the press conference. \"In his government, there is no freedom. There is no democracy. And the people have no power whatsoever.\" Referencing China launching military drills around the same time as his trip to Taiwan last year, McCaul quipped, \"I’m starting to think it’s me they don’t like.\" Wu said of the lawmakers’ visit, \"In this critical time, it’s a powerful gesture. It’s a powerful display of the strong bipartisan support for Taiwan by the United States.\" LAWMAKERS BRAWL AS TAIWAN'S PARLIAMENT DESCENDS INTO CHAOS McCaul brought Lai a Stetson hat as a gesture of goodwill.

The camaraderie between the U.S. lawmakers and Taiwanese officials was palpable during both meetings. In a lighthearted moment before his remarks with Lai, McCaul modeled the American-made Stetson he brought as a gift for Lai. The two men shared a hug and handshake after the conclusion of their public remarks. Elizabeth Elkind is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital leading coverage of the House of Representatives.

        "description": "\"A protracted stalemate might be the only solution for Russia to avoid total economic collapse,\" one economist says.",
        "content": "Russia's economy is completely dominated by its war in Ukraine, so much that Moscow cannot afford either to win or lose the war, according to one European economist. Renaud Foucart, a senior economics lecturer at Lancaster University, pointed to the dire economic situation facing Russia as the war in Ukraine wraps up its second year. Russia's GDP grew 5.5% year-over-year over the third quarter of 2023, according to data from the Russian government. But most of that growth is being fueled by the nation's monster military spending, Foucart said, with plans for the Kremlin to spend a record 36.6 trillion rubles, or $386 billion on defense this year. \"Military pay, ammunition, tanks, planes, and compensation for dead and wounded soldiers, all contribute to the GDP figures. Put simply, the war against Ukraine is now the main driver of Russia's economic growth\" Foucart said in an op-ed for The Conversation this week. Other areas of Russia's economy are hurting as the war drags on. Moscow is slammed with a severe labor shortage , thanks to young professionals fleeing the country or being pulled into the conflict. The nation is now short around 5 million workers , according to one estimate, which is causing wages to soar . Related stories Inflation is high at 7.4% — nearly double the 4% target of its central bank. Meanwhile, direct investment in the country has collapsed , falling around $8.7 billion in the first three quarters of 2023, per data from Russia's central bank. That all puts the Kremlin in a tough position, no matter the outcome of the war in Ukraine. Even if Russia wins, the nation can't afford to rebuild and secure Ukraine, due to the financial costs as well as the impact of remaining isolated from the rest of the global market . Western nations have shunned trade with Russia since it invaded Ukraine in 2022, which economists have said could severely crimp Russia's long-term economic growth. As long as it remains isolated, Russia's \"best hope\" is to become \"entirely dependent\" on China , one of its few remaining strategic allies, Foucart said. Meanwhile, the costs of rebuilding its own nation are already \"massive,\" he added, pointing to problems like broken infrastructure and social unrest in Russia. \"A protracted stalemate might be the only solution for Russia to avoid total economic collapse,\" Foucart wrote. \"The Russian regime has no incentive to end the war and deal with that kind of economic reality. So it cannot afford to win the war, nor can it afford to lose it. Its economy is now entirely geared towards continuing a long and ever deadlier conflict.\" Other economists have warned of trouble coming for Russia amid the toll of its war in Ukraine. Russia's economy will see significantly more degradation ahead, one London-based think tank recently warned, despite talk of Russia's resilience in the face of Western sanctions .

        "content": "Sam the Man's car 'scam': Dozens of customers allege car detailer took their vehicles and then held them to ransom By Freddy Pawle For Daily Mail Australia Published: 15:08 BST, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 15:31 BST, 27 May 2024 e-mail Alleged victims of a 'dodgy' car detailer have claimed their vehicles were held ransom for huge additional payments on works that never happened. The owner of Sam the Man Car Care, Sam Baravelli, 34, trusted to touch up the dream cars of of customers has instead been accused of using their vehicles as a way to extort them from more cash. Dozens of customers allege Mr Baravelli held their car for weeks longer than expected and charged exorbitant amounts - with some claiming they got them back in a worse state. Mr Baravelli was arrested by police last Tuesday after Consumer Affairs Victoria warned the public from taking their business to Sam the Man in January. Police towed away a dozen allegedly stolen vehicles from Baravelli's car shop in Footscray, inner-west Melbourne , before charging him with 33 counts each of car theft and obtaining property by deception. An allegedly dodgy car detailer, Sam Baravelli (pictured being arrested), has been accused of holding customers' cars to extort them of additional payments One of those allegedly affected by Bavarelli was 19-year-old apprentice mechanic, Josh Williams, who said his Nissan Skyline R34 was trashed by the car detailer. What was supposed to be a four week job quickly ballooned out to an almost two month project which wound up costing Mr Williams all of his savings, $17,194.50. After spending all of his money and still not getting his car back, Mr Williams took issues into his own hands and found the car at the business in a horrific condition. 'All of the paint protection has been taken off it, there's quite a few more scratches than were originally there,' he told A Current Affair. Read More Facebook Marketplace scam Australians need to know about 'My interior's absolutely trashed. There's stains everywhere. '(Baravelli) said there's more to be done, I told him I wouldn't pay for it ... If I stopped paying him, he wouldn't give me my car back. 'In a way I was being held ransom and my car was the bait.' Consumer Affairs Victoria director Nicole Rich warned the public of taking their business to Sam the Man after receiving over 70 complaints from members of the public. 'Not only were there breaches of consumer law, but there was also just potentially outright theft of vehicles occurring,' she said. 'We were very worried about Sam the Man Car Care based on the reports we were receiving from Victorian consumers about what was going on and I formed the view we needed to warn the public as a matter of urgency.' The watchdog's warning alleged Mr Barravelli made 'false or misleading representations as to the price of his services (and) increasing the initial quote'. '(Sam the Man allegedly) failed to carry out services within the agreed upon time or within a reasonable period of time and returned consumers' vehicles with further damage while the vehicle remained in Sam the Man's possession.' The warning also claimed that on three occasions, cars left with Sam the Man weren't returned to their owners. Apprentice mechanic, Josh Williams (pictured with his Nissan Skyline R34), claims Baravelli trashed his car despite paying him over $17,000 Police towed a dozen allegedly stolen vehicles from Baravelli's workshop (pictured), before charging him with 33 counts each of car theft and obtaining property by deception Victoria Police allege the scam was much broader and involved him holding 'onto customers' vehicles for unreasonably long periods and refused to return them until they paid a substantially higher fee than initially agreed'. '(Baravelli allegedly) requested payment for services he did not carry out, and also drove customers' cars for personal use'. Police will also allege he continued to take customer's cars and issue quotes after being evicted from the shop. However, Mr Baravelli said there was more to the story and that customers just didn't understand how he worked. 'I've tried to explain it as best I can because I feel like I owe the community a bit,' Baravelli told the program while being arrested. 'I never had the intention of taking anyone's car to do anything. 'All of the cars that are in there have had work done ... they've had work done on the road.' He has since been bailed and set to appear before the Melbourne Magistrates' Court on June 20. A woman from South Melbourne, 45, is also expected to be charged with theft of a motor vehicle and obtain property by deception. Police have urged anyone with information regarding the alleged scam to come forward as investigations remain ongoing.

Alexia Gallegos, from the US, is a mother of three, but it's the contents of her eldest child's school lunches that have been igniting controversy on Instagram. The mother, who insists that 'school lunches don't have to be cold and boring,' recently posted a video on her Instagram account, @lexymariee_, which features a detailed display of her lunch-packing routine. Posting the clip , Gallegos was seen preparing a freshly baked potato, topped with seasoned steak bites, shrimp, broccoli, grated cheese, and herbs, and wrote: 'Baked potato for the win.' A stay-at-home mother has faced backlash on social media after showcasing the elaborate school lunches she prepares for her nine-year-old daughter, including a loaded baked potato After neatly packing the main course into a circular pink Bentgo lunchbox, Gallegos added an array of snacks to her daughter's to-go bag. Read More I posted a photo of my kids' school lunchboxes but never expected such furious backlash over one tiny detail These included: a small container of pistachio nuts, a small container of Haribo Goldbear candy, a packet of chocolate-covered dried strawberries, a packed of sea-salt roasted seaweed and a packet of garden 'Veggie' straws. The mother then added extra snack items, such as two Ferrero Rocher chocolates, a Kinder Joy chocolate, a tub of jellied fruit, beef jerky, a gummy Pizza candy box and strawberry and cream Tic Tacs. To complete the meal, Gallegos included a Stanley flask filled with butterfly-shaped ice cubes and water, and a handwritten note that read: 'Hey beautiful, you are worth it ALWAYS! Keep being you! Love Mommy.' Despite Gallegos' display of motherly affection, over 54,000 Instagram users have expressed their shock and concern over the appropriateness of the lunch - with many criticizing the portion sizes and the nutritional value of the snacks. One person said: 'Sorry I feel bad saying it because you look so happy and made all with love... but this is so much food... also so much sugar for one day...' Another wrote: 'All the plastic waste... and wouldn't one kind of sweets be enough? No apple, no banana....' Meanwhile, one person joked, 'Is she going to school or building it?!,' while another teased, 'That little girl is still sitting in the cafeteria eating her lunch.' After neatly packing the main course into a circular pink Bentgo lunchbox, Gallegos adds an array of snacks to her daughter's to-go bag Despite Gallegos' display of motherly affection, over 54,000 Instagram users have expressed their shock and concern over the appropriateness of the lunch A third quipped: 'Not sure if we are trying to k**l her with diabetes, or room temperature shrimp.' A third said: 'Idk about anything else but that ice p****d me off she's not even gonna see the shape of the butterfly it's going to melt.' A teacher confirmed that the video is likely to be a truthful representation of the child's daily lunch, writing: 'I've seen lunches like this before. Kids take one or two bites of the main and then eat the packaged food. Pack less. They don't need it.' Meanwhile, an Instagram user claiming to be a school administrator, said: 'As a school administrator, we do not allow teachers to warm kids lunches up, so she's eating it cold the next day.' It comes after an Australian mother was forced to defend her choice to send her four-year-old daughter to school with a boiled egg in June 2021.

        "description": "With the US obesity rate hovering at around 40%, tens of millions of Americans could take GLP-1 drugs over the next few years.",
        "content": "The more people who take GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, the faster the US economy could grow, a Goldman Sachs analyst said in a note last month. The US GDP could grow by an extra 1% if 60 million Americans took GLP-1 drugs by 2028, Jan Hatzius, the chief economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote. Hatzius said health-related problems keep people from participating in the labor force and inhibit economic growth. Obesity increases the risk of serious health problems, including heart attacks, strokes, and diabetes. \"Combining current losses in hours worked and labor force participation from sickness and disability, early deaths, and informal caregiving, we estimate that GDP would potentially be over 10% higher if poor health outcomes did not limit labor supply in the US,\" Hatzius said. So drugs that have shown promise in improving a range of patient health outcomes could have a sizable impact on the broader economy. \"The main reason we see meaningful upside from healthcare innovation is that poor health imposes significant economic costs. There are several channels through which poor health weighs on economic activity that could diminish if health outcomes improve,\" Hatzius said. Related stories GLP-1 drugs from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly and Company are sold under the brand names Ozempic and Mounjaro to treat type 2 diabetes, and under the names Wegovy and Zepbound to treat obesity. Sales of the drugs have exploded, with some users seeing drastic weight loss of up to 20%. A study released in August found that patients who took Wegovy for weight loss reduced their risk of heart attacks, strokes, and cardiovascular death by 20%. And with the US obesity rate hovering at around 40%, tens of millions of Americans could be prescribed GLP-1 drugs over the next few years, but just how many will depend on the outcome of clinical trials on these drugs and whether health insurers will cover them. \"If GLP-1 usage ultimately increases by this amount and results in lower obesity rates, we see scope for significant spillovers to the broader economy,\" Hatzius said. One spillover effect could be an increase in productivity, Hatzius said, citing academic studies that found obese individuals are less likely to work and to be less productive at work \"These estimates therefore suggest that obesity-related health complications subtract over 3% from per-capita output, implying an over 1% hit to total output when combined with the over 40% incidence of obesity in the US population,\" Hatzius said. And if there are more productivity gains via improved health outcomes, the impact on GDP growth in excess of its current trend could be between 0.6% and 3.2%. \"Historically, health advancements have lowered the number of life years lost to disease and disability by 10% per decade in DM economies, and we estimate that a 10-year step forward in health progress in excess of current trends could raise the level of US GDP by 1%,\" Hatzius said.

        "content": "With the Kolkata Knight Riders lifting the trophy, star all-rounder Andre Russell said he feels excited over his contributions to the team's journey in the IPL and it's a special feeling. Kolkata defeated Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL 2024 finals at the MA Chidambaram Stadium and registered the title to their name for the third time. ADVERTISEMENT Mitchell Starc, Andre Russell's exceptional spells and Venkatesh Iyer's gritty fifty helped KKR successfully chase the target in the IPL 2024 finals against SRH. Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head who showcased their explosive batting approach in most of the SRH's IPL 2024, got a taste of their own medicine in the finals. In a battle of two big buys, the Australian stars Cummins (Rs 20.5 crore for SRH) and Starc (Rs 24.75 crore for KKR), it was the latter who prevailed. \"When you're a part of this squad, not playing or not involved in the field, but supporting the guys all the way, it's always a good feeling, but this is a special feeling. In the XI, playing a part in the final, contributing as well through my leadership and everything, it's an exciting feeling. It's special,\" Russell said on Jio Cinema. The 36-year-old cricketer further spoke about his batting technique. \"It's just me not clearing my front leg too much, standing as still as possible, and waiting as long as possible. Normally, this is my trigger movement, clearing my left leg, so I tried to keep it as still as possible. So, if the bowler bowls wide, I push straight and I have access because I am standing on the off-stump,\" the West Indies all-rounder added. Earlier, SRH won the toss and elected to bat in the IPL 2024 finals. KKR rocked SRH with continuous wickets, with the big buy justifying his Rs 24.75 crore price tag. Only skipper Pat Cummins (24 in 19 balls, with two fours and a six) and Aiden Markram (20 in 23 balls, with three fours) touched the 20-run mark and SRH was bundled out for 113 in 18.3 overs. Andre Russell (3/19) was the top bowler for KKR. Starc (2/14) and Harshit Rana (2/24) also contributed well with the ball. Sunil Narine, Varun Chakravarthy and Vaibhav Arora took a wicket each. KKR pulled off the run-chase of 114 runs in just 10.3 overs with eight wickets in hand, with Venkatesh Iyer (52* in 26 balls, with four boundaries and three sixes) and Rahmanullah Gurbaz (39 in 32 balls, with five fours and two sixes) shining for KKR.",

        "description": "England all-rounder Will Jacks says his experience playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL) was the \"perfect preparation\" for the T20 World Cup.",
        "content": "Will Jacks averages 18.16 in 12 T20s for England Jacks, 25, is set to feature in his first global tournament for England off the back of making his debut in the IPL, which is widely considered the best franchise league in the world. He played eight times for Royal Challengers Bengaluru, and hit an in a winning run chase against Gujarat Titans as his side recovered from a poor start to reach the play-offs. Jacks left the tournament early to join England, whose preparation for the T20 World Cup is limited. They have only played 13 T20s since winning the tournament in Australia in November 2022. They are in the middle of a four-match series against Pakistan but the opening game was rained off, while may also be affected by bad weather. \"It [the IPL] was perfect preparation,\" Jacks, who made his 12th England T20 appearance in , told BBC Sport. \"It was amazing. I think everything that happens there with the crowd, the atmosphere, obviously the attention, it was completely different to anything I've experienced before but it felt great preparation. \"Going into that game at Edgbaston [on Saturday], I didn't feel really nervous to be honest. Obviously playing for England is unbelievable but I didn't feel like an extra surge of pressure or expectation. \"I think from what I've experienced over the last two months, it kind of came naturally to me and I felt very comfortable with it and the IPL helped. Every game has got such an onus on it and the expectation of the fans and the crowd, it's all there.\" Jacks has been a regular at the top of Surrey's side in the T20 Blast and impressed in T20 franchise leagues in Australia, Pakistan and South Africa. He has struggled to nail down a regular spot in international cricket due to the depth of the talent pool, but feels his role is now clearly defined ahead of travelling to the Caribbean. \"I know I'm going to bat number three now so it's something I've got my head around over the last six months,\" said Jacks. \"We've got two great openers who are going to set the platform and whatever situation I come in at I've got to be ready for that - and that's all been part of the learning curve. \"I feel much more comfortable now than I did in November in the Caribbean, and hopefully that will just keep growing. The more experiences I get there, the better I will come at it.\" Jacks said he \"learned a lot\" by batting at three for RCB with \"different conditions and coming in at different times during the game\" aiding his development. He is also a useful off-spinner and that may be a crucial asset for England with pitches in the Caribbean likely to aid slow bowling. \"I do [expect to bowl],\" said Jacks. \"I'll be ready, I've done my work. I'll be preparing like every other bowler and I'll be ready if needed. \"I'm really excited. I've dreamed of this obviously since I was a little boy and I've missed out on the last few which hurt me a little bit. I really wanted to be there and I'm really excited for this and hopefully we'll go there and win it.\"",

        "content": "In a significant announcement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has declared a public holiday on May 28 to commemorate Youm-e-Takbeer. This decision marks a nationwide celebration of Pakistan’s nuclear capabilities and the day the country emerged as the first Islamic nuclear power. The Cabinet Division has officially issued a notification confirming that May 28 will be a general holiday. This means all government and private institutions across Pakistan will remain closed in observance of Youm-e-Takbeer. Citizens are encouraged to participate in the celebrations and reflect on the historical significance of this day. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif emphasized the importance of Youm-e-Takbeer, describing it as a day that made the country’s defense invincible. He highlighted the role of political and defense forces in strengthening Pakistan’s security. “Youm-e-Takbeer is a reminder of our commitment to thwart the malicious intentions of both external and internal enemies,” he stated. Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and the Pakistan Armed Forces for their pivotal roles in achieving nuclear capability. Additionally, he acknowledged the contributions of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto for initiating Pakistan’s nuclear program. The Prime Minister underscored the need to ensure the country’s economic security, drawing a parallel to the invincibility achieved in defense on May 28. “Let us pledge today to not only defeat external enemies but also thwart elements seeking to create chaos, such as the events of May 9,” he urged. Youm-e-Takbeer is celebrated annually on May 28, commemorating the day in 1998 when Pakistan conducted five successful nuclear tests in response to India’s nuclear tests. These tests were carried out in the Chagai district of Balochistan under the leadership of then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. This historic achievement solidified Pakistan’s position as a nuclear power and is remembered with pride and patriotism. As Pakistan prepares to observe this significant holiday, citizens are reminded of the importance of unity and strength. Youm-e-Takbeer is not just a day off but a symbol of national pride and resilience. It is a day to honor the past and commit to a secure and prosperous future. Join the nation in celebrating Youm-e-Takbeer on May 28 and pay tribute to the remarkable achievements that have made Pakistan a formidable force on the global stage.",

        "content": "Heeramandi’s Tajdaar aka Taha Shah Badussha recently opened up on getting slammed for Cannes appearance. In a recent interview, the actor finally addressed the rumours of going to the film festival without invitation. New Delhi: Last week, actor Taha Shah Badussha made waves with his appearance at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival. While his presence sparked a mix of support and scepticism, the actor has now clarified the purpose behind his Cannes debut. In a recent interview, Taha candidly discussed the reasons for his visit and responded to online chatter. Taha Shah’s candid revelation on Cannes appearance Taha’s appearance at Cannes was tied to the trailer and poster launch of his film Paro at the Bharat Pavilion. Despite some reports claiming he looked “uncertain” on the red carpet and was seen signalling photographers to capture his moments, Taha dismissed the criticism as bizarre. “I don’t get the time to go on social media, but I see screenshots from various groups. Nobody said these things about me earlier. I did some jugaad and went to IFFI last year, but nobody spoke about it. What about that?” he told News18, addressing the rumours. A post shared by Taha Shah Badussha (@taahashah) Taha openly admitted that part of his mission at Cannes was to network. Known for his hustle, he embraced the festival as a platform to make valuable industry connections. “I went to Cannes to launch my film and to make contacts. So many people from America and Canada looked at me and said, ‘This guy is the star of Heeramandi but he’s acting like a newcomer’. I literally went around giving my card to people asking them to be in touch with me and watch Heeramandi ,” he shared. Taha Shah at Cannes 2024 Reflecting on his networking efforts, Taha stressed the importance of perseverance. “I may not need to do this, but I know where I come from. I always say that one day, you’ll find one golden person who will change your life. Out of the 500-600 people I met in Cannes, I need one person to believe in me. I’ll keep hustling. I’ll keep building relationships and putting in my hundred per cent,” he added. A post shared by Taha Shah Badussha (@taahashah) Taha’s Cannes stint came shortly after the release of Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar , which garnered him significant acclaim. The positive reception he received at the French Riviera left him overwhelmed.",

        "description": "Works prioritised into eight groups, including sub-transmission works proposed under the Centrally aided Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme and larger schemes under TransGrid 2.0",
        "content": "The unexpected levels to which summer demand for electricity rose this year have prompted the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) to list out priorities afresh for strengthening the internal power transmission network under a revised ₹663-crore plan outlay for the 2024-25 fiscal. The works have been prioritised into eight groups which include sub-transmission works (33 KV) proposed under the Centrally aided Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) as well as larger schemes under TransGrid 2.0, which is aimed at strengthening Kerala’s internal power transmission system. Outlay slashed The financial crisis it has been going through had forced the power utility to slash the 2024-25 outlay for its transmission wing from the original ₹1,069.86 crore to ₹663 crore. Thirty-two works totalling ₹125 crore aimed at augmenting the 33 kV sub-transmission network have been included in the ‘Priority-1’ list. In a May 22 order, the KSEB management underscored the need for intelligent deployment of resources in the “most needy areas” while tackling regional imbalances in supply. The Priority-1 works, listed for funding under RDSS, are underway. “Execution of works included in this category is very much essential even if RDSS funding is not available, in view of the criticality of these works,” the KSEB has noted. The fierce summer heat had rapidly driven up power demand in the State during March and April. Daily consumption had shot up to a record 115.94 million units (mu) and the peak demand, to 5,797 megawatts (MW). The evening demand had soared, largely driven by the widespread use of ACs and the practice of charging EVs in the late evening hours. Due to the charging of e-vehicles at night, the load on the transformers had risen leading to blown fuses and power outages, according to the KSEB. Demand drops With the strengthening of summer rainfall, however, the demand has dropped dramatically. For instance, the daily consumption on May 26, Sunday, stood at 72.30 mu. Apart from sub-transmission works, the priority list for 2024-25 includes TransGrid works funded through various agencies, and ongoing and new projects.

        "content": "Following the murder of a 21-year-old youth at Malayampalayam in Kodumudi block in Erode in the late hours of Sunday, the parents and relatives of the victim staged a protest outside the Government Headquarters Hospital in Erode here on Monday seeking the arrest of the accused, and demanding action against the Inspector of Police of Malayampalayam police station for failing to act. The police said that S. Harish of Muniyappan Palayam left with his friend Gowtham on a two-wheeler to consume liquor at Sanarmedu Road in the area. Another youth, identified as Vellingiri, intercepted the two-wheeler and had an altercation with Harish. Vellingiri allegedly took a knife and stabbed Harish in the neck and fled the spot. Harish died on the way to hospital. As the news spread, parents and relatives gathered at the hospital. They gathered in front of the mortuary and staged a sit-in. Later, they threatened to stage a protest on the road and rushed towards the entrance. But, the policemen closed the gate and prevented their march. ‘ The protesters said that Harish and Vellingiri had a dispute over a love affair, and had attacked each other during a temple festival. They took up the matter earlier with the Inspector, who failed to act. They alleged that Vellingiri’s friends were also involved in the murder. If the Inspector had taken action, the murder could have been prevented, the relatives said. Later, the protesters forcefully opened the gate and staged a protest outside the hospital. M. Sathish Kumar, Revenue Divisional Officer, Erode, and senior police officials held talks with the protesters and assured them of proper action, after which the protest was withdrawn.

        "content": "The UK government offers support measures for the semiconductor industry but it may still not be enough to measure up to US and European grants. One of Britain's biggest microchip plants is at risk of closure, following Apple's cancellation of a major supply deal. The factory, owned by US semiconductor company Coherent, is based in Newton Aycliffe, in County Durham. Apple recently announced it would be changing some of its FaceID features in its upcoming iPhone version, thus not needing Coherent's chips anymore. The UK Coherent factory has been responsible for producing components for the FaceID technology. As Apple was the factory's primary client, the cancellation could mean the plant being shut down, dealing another major blow to the British semiconductor industry as a whole. The County Durham factory has already had layoffs, with some 100 of 257 people let go last year. Coherent UK is currently exploring options such as selling, or implementing new technology, in an effort to take the plant in a new direction. In a last-time-buy notice to its clients, Coherent UK said, as reported by The Telegraph: \"Unfortunately the supply to the primary customer ceased at the end of Financial Year 2023. This places the ongoing viability of the business in doubt. A strategic review of the business is currently being undertaken with potential new technologies and/or sale of the business as options under consideration.\" According to predictions, the new iPhone 16 models may have bigger screens and slimmer bezels. Apple is also rumoured to be experimenting with folding models for the iPhone, however, these are not likely to launch until 2025, because of difficulties in ensuring that quality is not compromised. As with recent iPhone models, the iPhone 16 is also expected to make greater use of AI, especially generative AI features for its Messaging app and Siri. Furthermore, the company is likely to use bigger language models, which may increase Siri’s comprehension and assistance abilities. These new AI updates are also expected to impact the FaceID feature, especially at a time when more concerns have emerged about facial recognition technology being biased and potentially violating privacy concerns. The British semiconductor industry has been losing out over the past few years, as the global chip industry has made a move to Asia. Back in 2017, Apple dealt a similar blow to Imagination Technologies, another British chip company. After Apple announced it would no longer be using Imagination Technologies' graphics chip designs, the semiconductor company saw its value halve, before it was sold off. Other chip companies such as Wolfson Microelectronics and Volex have also suffered share price devaluations and takeovers in the past few years. This has left the UK dangerously dependent on foreign suppliers, many of which are based in South East Asia, especially Taiwan, which is seeing rising geopolitical tensions with China. Although the UK government has announced a £1 billion(€1.18 billion) semiconductor industry support strategy last year, this has been repeatedly pushed back over the past few months, with it now expected to go in place after the UK elections. Even when it is finally implemented, it may still not be enough to counter the decades-old head start several Asian countries have, nor the substantial semiconductor subsidies offered by the US and Europe.",

The landslide crashed through Yambali village in the country's north at around 3am on Friday while most of the community slept. Hundreds of houses were buried beneath debris almost two stories high as rescuers told local media they heard screams from beneath the earth. Initial reports put the estimated number of casualties at more than 670, but updated figures released by the government's National Disaster Centre this morning raised the shocking toll to more than 2,000. Delivering an official statement today, King Charles said: 'I have witnessed first-hand and have great admiration for the extraordinary resilience of the peoples of Papua New Guinea and the Highlands. I have faith that your communities will come together to support the survivors and the recovery in these heartbreaking circumstances. 'My wife joins me in sending our most heartfelt condolences to the families and communities who have suffered so much as a result of this appallingly traumatic event. Papua New Guinea is very much in our special thoughts and prayers.'

But the remote location of the disaster and the treacherous terrain over which it occurred have impeded the delivery of aid and means the chances of rescue for any remaining survivors are very low.

'But I cannot retrieve the bodies so I am standing here helplessly.' More than 72 hours after the landslide residents are still using spades, sticks and their bare hands to try and shift the debris and reach any survivors. Heavy equipment and aid have been slow to arrive due to the remote location while tribal warfare nearby has forced aid workers to travel in convoys escorted by soldiers and return to the provincial capital, roughly 35 miles away, at night. The official statement from the Palace is pictured The government figure is roughly triple the U.N. estimate of 670 killed by the landslide in the South Pacific island nation's mountainous interior Relief workers gather around provisions to be distributed, in the aftermath of a landslide in Enga Province This picture shows a demolished house at the site of a landslide at Yambali Village Eight people were killed and 30 houses burnt down on Saturday, a U.N. agency official said. Aid convoys on Monday passed the still smoking remains of houses. The first excavator only reached the site late on Sunday, according to a U.N. official. Six bodies have been retrieved so far. Contact with other parts of the country is difficult due to patchy reception and limited electricity at the site. Many people aren't even sure where their loved ones were when the landslide hit because it's common for residents to stay at the homes of friends and relatives, according to Matthew Hewitt Tapus, a pastor based in Port Moresby whose home village is roughly 12 miles from the disaster zone. 'It's not like everyone is in the same house at the same time, so you have fathers who don't know where their children are, mothers who don't know where husbands are, it's chaotic,' he told Reuters by phone. Locals gather at the site of a landslide at Mulitaka village Locals and members of United Nations (UN) take part in search and rescue efforts, led by Papua New Guinea's Defense Force Prime Minister James Marape's office said the disaster was being handled by PNG emergency authorities and Marape was in the capital Port Moresby preparing for the return of parliament on Tuesday, where he faces a no-confidence motion. Even when rescue teams can get to the site, rain, unstable ground and flowing water is making it extremely dangerous for residents and rescue teams to clear debris, according to Serhan Aktoprak, the chief of the U.N. migration agency's mission in PNG. There is still a risk the soil and debris could shift again and more than 250 homes have been abandoned as officials encourage people to evacuate, he said. More than 1,250 people have been displaced. Some local residents also don't want heavy machinery and excavators entering the village and interrupting the mourning, he said. 'At this point, people I think are realising that the chances are very slim, that anyone can basically be taken out alive,' he said. Australia's Defense Minister Richard Marles told the media that his office has been working with their Papua New Guinea counterparts since Friday's disaster. 'The exact nature of the support that we do provide will play out over the coming days. We've obviously (have) airlift capacity to get people there. There may be other equipment that we can bring to bear in terms of the search and rescue (and other matters)... that we are talking through with PNG right now,' he said. Papua New Guinea is a former Australian colony, achieving independence in 1975.

        "content": "Article content Council adds 8.22. Sandwich Street Infrastructure Enhancement Heritage Permit to the consent agenda. Read the Star’s coverage of plans for the city to fund nearly $400,000 in improvements to Sandwich Street — improvements that go alongside upgrades being done by the Gordie Howe bridge team — . Council moves on to the consent agenda. Ward 4 Coun. Mark McKenzie and Ward 3 Coun. Renaldo Agostino declare conflicts of interest on Official Plan Amendment and Zoning By-law Amendment Applications for 835 Tecumseh Road East, 2148 Marentette Avenue, and 2175 Parent Avenue. Both men are members of the Giovanni Caboto Club, which is requesting the ZBA to build housing on the property. Read the Star’s coverage and . Francis asks when residents will be heard and when they can speak to these developments. Payne says it would be when the EOI process happens. No date has been set. Francis refers to a line in the report that indicates developers approach folks at city hall about building on city-owned properties. He wants to know how those conversations are disclosed. Payne explains: “Whenever developers come to us, what we typically do is we hear them out, we listen to what their what their ideas are. We provide guidance based on the expertise of various departments, but ultimately we always direct them back to our formal process which is either an RFP or an EOI process that is then open and transparent.” Francis asks if a developer spoke with anyone at city hall about developing the Roseland property before council decided to make it available for residential development. Payne says she is not aware of any such conversations. City CAO Joe Mancina says the same thing. Francis asks Ray Mensour, city commissioner of community service, when the results of the public survey about development on the Roseland property will come back to council. Mensour says it will come back in a report about the EOI for that property. The survey results will inform the EOI, Mensour says. Francis has questions on the Housing Solutions Made for Windsor. He asks any residents in the gallery who are present because of the Roseland petition to raise their hands. At least two dozen people put their hands up. Francis asks about the public consultation process. Residents want their voices heard. Francis notes that the council majority voted to build housing on these city-owned properties without hearing from the public first. Jelena Payne, the city’s commissioner of economic development, explains that the expression of interest process will allow the city to gather ideas/vision from developers. Once the city has architectural renderings from developers, “viable concepts related to residential developments,” they will be brought to council for “further refinement.” The process can take years, Payne says. “We want to make sure we do our due diligence. We want to make sure we consult the public throughout the process. We have multiple touch points with council throughout the process to, ultimately, hopefully, get the best development possible for the community.” Francis says he thinks the public should have been engaged before council made its decision to move forward with any residential development on city-owned land. This elicits a short round of applause from residents in the audience. Administration says there will be opportunities for public consultation as the process progresses for each lot individually. The report is about issuing requests for expressions of interest (EOI) from developers interested in building housing on several city properties. Check out the Star’s coverage of city council’s decision to build housing on five city-owned properties . Ward 1 Coun. Fred Francis makes a motion to move a petition from residents of the Roseland neighbourhood and surrounding area to a future council meeting as a regular business item so residents can delegate. City clerk Steve Vlachodimos says Francis cannot do that, procedurally, because he voted against the related item about building a luxury condo on Roseland Golf and Curling Club property. A councillor who voted in favour of that item could reopen that debate, Vlachodimos says, but Francis cannot. It would technically be a “motion to reconsider.” Today’s city council meeting has begun.

        "content": "TOMMY Creamer has signed a contract extension at Colwyn Bay FC. Fan favourite Creamer has committed to the Seagulls for another season, having made 77 appearances, and scored 13 goals, during his time at the Bay. The most notable of these goals were spectacular long range efforts against Cefn Druids in September 2022 and Barry Town United in August 2023, which won Sgorio’s Goal of the Month. Creamer joined the Bay in 2021 and made his debut as a late second half substitute away to Penrhyncoch in August 2021, scoring his first goal for the club in the same game in a 4-0 win. However, he missed the majority of that season after suffering a serious injury in a game against Llandudno FC in September, only making his comeback, against Llandudno, at the start of the following season. He was ever-present in Bay’s match day squad during the their season in the Cymru Premier. Creamer progressed through the ranks at Wrexham prior to his release and was a key part of Conwy’s treble-winning side of 2017-18. He then had a successful spell at Rhyl before returning to his home town club Conwy.",
